      <title>Supreme Court Takes A Closer Look At Access To Abortion Pill</title>
      <description>Today, the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that could decide future access to the abortion drug mifepristone. The highly effective pill is taken to terminate a pregnancy, and shortly after Roe v. Wade was overturned, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine sued the Federal Drug Administration for their quick approval and wide accessibility guidelines for mifepristone. Both the GOP and the Biden administration have seized upon this Supreme Court case as a political moment--a chance to talk to voters about the issue. President of the Alliance Defending Freedom, Kristin Waggoner, joins the Rundown to explain her organization’s argument against expanded access to this abortion pill and the huge impact this SCOTUS case may have.
Last week, over one hundred Russians died at the hands of terrorists after four men opened fire at a concert hall in Moscow. However, President Vladimir Putin is blaming Ukraine, despite ISIS-K claiming credit for the attack and various Western intelligence agencies showing evidence corroborating their assertions. FOX News correspondent Benjamin Hall joins the podcast to describe what led up to the carnage, why Putin is shifting blame towards Ukraine, and explain why the United States and the Taliban share disdain for the same terrorist organization.
Plus, commentary from the host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <description>Israel canceled sending a delegation to Washington D.C. to discuss the planned military operation in Rafah after the United States abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire. The United Nations Security Council passed the resolution 14-0. The United Sates has been urging Israel not to launch the offensive into Rafah which would force over a million Palestinians to evacuate.   

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Trey Yingst, FOX news foreign correspondent reporting from Tel Aviv, about the growing tensions between the U.S. and Israel and the continuing operation in the large Al-Shifa medical facility.

      <title>Republican Conference Split As Congresswoman Greene Looks To Oust Speaker Johnson</title>
      <description>Early Saturday morning, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to pass a bipartisan funding bill, that keeps the government open through September. The bill caused some angst in the Republican held House, to question Speaker Johnson's leadership, and now Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has made a move to vacate Johnson from his position. Chair of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic Brad Wenstrup (R-OH-2) joins the Rundown to discuss Congresswoman Greene's move to oust the Speaker, the deadly ISIS-K terror attack at a Russian concert hall, and the Congressman explains the goals of his EDUCATE Act. 

Homeowners in states like California and Florida have struggled to insure their properties due to the prevalence of natural disasters in both states. Last week, State Farm announced plans to drop coverage for 72,000 homes in California starting this summer. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed bills back in December that aimed to stabilize the insurance market; however, some Floridians are still unable to afford their homes. FOX Business real estate contributor and host of “Mansion Global,” Katrina Campins, explains why insurance companies are leaving Florida and how this insurance crisis has driven up the cost of living.

Plus, commentary from FOX News Senior Meteorologist and host of The Janice Dean Podcast, Janice Dean.

      <title>Extra: Why Influencers Are Ticked Off About The TikTok Ban Bill</title>
      <description>Earlier this month, the House voted overwhelmingly to pass a bill banning TikTok if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, doesn’t sell the app to an American owner. 
As the bill awaits a vote in the Senate, many users of the controversial social media platform have voiced their outrage over the legislation. Many TikTok users even say the popular video app has become a major source of income for their families.
Two Influencers angry over the bill are owners of Bar7Ranch, Cody and Erika Archie.
Cody and Erika recently joined host FOX News Rundown host Dave Anthony to discuss how a ban will negatively impact small businesses like theirs, and how they feel about critics of the app who say it is a spying tool for China.
They also shared how they began influencing, why they think videos about their lives and animals are popular, and how people like them have turned short video clips into cash.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear more from TikTok influencers and Cody and Erika Archie. On today’s FOX News Rundown Extra, you’ll hear more about the couple and the app at the center of this international debate.

      <title>From Washington: An Israeli Delegation Heads to Washington</title>
      <description>As an Israeli Delegation heads to Washington for a meeting at the White House next week, the future of a post-war Gaza remains in question as President Biden stands ardent on a two-state solution. White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby joins to discuss what issues will take top priority in next week's meeting between the President and Israeli leaders, why ground operations in Rafah would be a "disaster" for the Gazan refugees with Hamas still at large, and how the U.S. is working to find new means of transporting food and humanitarian aid into Gaza.
President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have received enough delegates to be their party's nominee. However, one question remains: who will Trump choose as his running mate? New names emerge as potential Vice President nominees each week, making the shortlist not so short. Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove joins to discuss who the options for the V.P. ticket are, and why it provides a window into the candidate's thought process.

      <title>From Washington: Another Shutdown Showdown</title>
      <description>Amid discussions about the near trillion-dollar spending bill to keep government operations running, many lawmakers are raising questions about the allocation of funding for foreign aid. Meanwhile, House Republicans are dealing with yet another blow to their majority as Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) announced plans to vacate in April, leaving the margin of error by one single vote in the halls of Congress. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram explores the different variables at play for these unfolding developments.
This week, the Supreme Court heard several arguments relating to free speech. The week began with the Murthy v. Missouri case, in which state officials argued that the Biden administration worked alongside Big Tech companies to censor content related to the pandemic and 2020 presidential election. UC Berkeley Law School Professor John Yoo analyzes the arguments heard and explains what sort of pressure amounts to a violation of the First Amendment.

      <title>Is the President’s Voting Coalition Collapsing?</title>
      <description>President Joe Biden spent time drumming up support in key battleground states this week. In Arizona, the President said that his campaign "desperately" needs help from Latino voters, a demographic that has been increasing its support for former President Donald Trump. FOX News Sunday Anchor and Living the Bream podcast host Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to discuss why the President is losing support from key groups, and other warning signals for both candidates. Plus, Bream breaks down the Supreme Court case regarding the government's alleged attempt to censor conservatives on social media, and how she selects her March Madness bracket.
Work culture in the United States is rapidly changing, especially following the remote work boom that came with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as more of the country returns to office life, young Americans are beginning to contest the traditional 9-to-5 work culture, and how other generations defined a so-called "work-life balance. Founder and managing partner of the Bahnsen Group, David Bahnsen, joins Dana Perino to discuss his new book, Full-Time: Work and the Meaning of Life, and why he thinks the concept of work-life balance is a "mirage."
Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of “Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla.”

      <title>Evening Edition: Senators Want To Declassify TikTok Intel  </title>
      <description>A bipartisan group of Senators, who attended a closed door national security meeting, say the public should also be aware of the classified information they have on the influence and reach of TikTok. The meeting follows the House's recent passage of a bill that requires TikTok to divest or see itself banned in the United States. The Senators say they are very concerned with the amount of personal data TikTok shares with the Chinese government.

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Jake Denton, Research Associate in the Tech Policy Center at The Heritage Foundation, about what could have possibly been said to cause the Senators to become so concerned.

      <title>Texas' Tough Border Bill Spurs Judicial Whiplash</title>
      <description>A federal appeals court blocked a Texas law that would allow the state’s own law enforcement to arrest migrants suspected of illegally crossing the border, a decision that came just hours after the Supreme Court ruled the bill could take effect. This state immigration law, S.B. 4, has two key parts: it would make illegal crossings a Class B misdemeanor and would require state judges to order migrants convicted of crossing to return to Mexico. Texas’ Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber joins the Rundown to give his perspective on the border crisis, why he believes the bill won’t shrink the rising illegal crossings, and what kind of action he wants to see from the Biden administration.
Much of Haiti has become lawless, with hundreds of rival gangs taking control of the country’s capital city, Port-au-Prince. Violent criminals have overrun the island nation, demanding the resignation of Haitian Prime Minister Henry, leaving thousands of innocent civilians dead in their wake and Americans stranded with few escape routes. The State Department is working to get those Americans home, but the task remains difficult as U.S. citizens have been "left to their own devices." FOX News National Correspondent Bryan Llenas joins to describe what he is seeing at the Haitian border in the Dominican Republic and what kind of international help Hatians are pleading for.
Plus, commentary by Jason Rantz, host of “The Jason Rantz Show” and author of "What's Killing America."

      <title>Evening Edition: Texas Immigration Law Back On Hold  </title>
      <description>A federal appeals court has put a Texas law that allows local police to arrest and deport migrants accused of illegally entering the United States back on hold. This decision came just hours after the Supreme Court decided the law can be enforced. Another obstacle in implementing this law is that Mexico said it will not accept migrants expelled by Texas “under any circumstances."  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Lora Ries, Director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at The Heritage Foundation and former Department of Homeland Security official for the Trump Administration, who says the situation on the ground does not match the action being taken.

      <title>The Trouble Surrounding Trump Tower</title>
      <description>Former President Trump is facing a new legal roadblock: he must post over $450 million for bond in his New York civil case due to fines for manipulating property valuations. If the former President is unable to secure the funds for the bond, the courts could move to seize his properties, like Trump Tower, as collateral in the case. Law professor at George Washington University Jonathan Turley joins the Rundown to explain why the judge in the case was able to hand down such a large penalty, why he feels that the fine is not proportional to the crime, and how some of the other legal cases against the former President could factor into the 2024 election.
The House voted 352-65 on a bill that would ban TikTok if their Chinese parent company, ByteDance, doesn’t sell the app to an American owner. Now, the bill awaits a vote in the Senate. President Joe Biden has vowed to sign the legislation if it makes its way to his desk, but TikTok users and influencers are now publicly lobbying against this legislation. Influencers and owners of Bar7Ranch, Cody and Erika Archie, join to discuss how a ban will negatively impact small businesses, how they first began influencing, and their belief that lawmakers are focused on the wrong issues.
Plus, commentary by FOX News Senior Meteorologist, Janice Dean.

      <title>Is The Government Illegally Censoring Social Media Content?</title>
      <description>How much contact should the federal government have with private social media platforms? When does that contact turn into censorship? Those were the factors the Supreme Court weighed on Monday, as they heard arguments in the Murthy v. Missouri case, where Missouri and Louisiana attorneys general allege social media companies like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) suppressed speech by encouraging them to remove misinformation about various topics like the COVID-19 vaccine. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey joins the Rundown to explain his state’s lawsuit, the threat posed by media censorship, and why he wants “a wall of separation between tech and state.”
President Biden travels to two battleground states this week in an effort to win over Arizona and Nevada voters as he heads into a rematch with former President Donald Trump. However, recent polling shows that Trump is ahead in both of these states, spelling trouble for the Biden 2024 reelection campaign. FOX News contributor and Democratic strategist Leslie Marshall joins the podcast to discuss the latest reports that the President is unhappy with his 2024 campaign efforts, a political shift occurring with Black and Hispanic voters, and why she doesn't trust the current polling.
Plus, commentary by New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz.

      <title>Evening Edition: Hamas Leader Killed During Hospital Raid   </title>
      <description>The Israeli military raided the largest hospital in Gaza, the Shifa Hospital, accusing Hamas of using it to hide weapons and militants. The IDF says they killed a high ranking Hamas commander that was hiding in the hospital. Meanwhile, Israelis, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, are reacting to the speech Senator Schumer made last week calling for new elections and a pause in military operations.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official, advisor to two Jerusalem mayors and author of "Inside the Middle East: Making Sense of the most Dangerous and Complicates Region on Earth", who shared his thoughts on the recent military activity and his reasons for saying that, in the end, this war will also help the Palestinians.

      <title>House Oversight Chairman James Comer Gets Ready For Next Hunter Biden Hearing</title>
      <description>The House Oversight Committee is set to have another hearing this week, into the alleged foreign business dealings of the President's son, Hunter Biden. The hearing is meant to focus on inconsistencies between Hunter's closed-door testimony, and the testimony of former business associates such as Devon Archer and Tony Bobulinski. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY-1) joins the FOX News Rundown to discuss the goals of the hearing, what his investigation into Hunter's business dealings has uncovered, and weighs in on the retirement of Colorado Republican Congressman Ken Buck.

A unique period is now underway in college sports. Court rulings in recent years have granted student athletes the right to make money selling their name, image, and likeness (NIL). Eager players are now pursuing deals and sponsorships, but many experts, like former Alabama football coach and sports commentator Nick Saban, are raising red flags, saying the NIL changes jeopardize the future of collegiate sports. Brian Kilmeade, co-host of FOX and Friends and host of One Nation with Brian Kilmeade, joins to discuss how these NIL deals have undeniable benefits for young athletes but, while unregulated, have transformed college sports into “the Wild West,” where the richest schools can dominate.

Plus, commentary from author of "You Will Own Nothing" Carol Roth.

      <title>Extra: What's Behind Boeing's Big Problems?</title>
      <description>Boeing has big problems.
 In January, an Alaskan Airlines flight made headlines after a door plug blew off because of faulty plugs during the flight, causing panic and major safety concerns. Following the incident, 33 of the 89 audits conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration failed, propelling Boeing back into the hot seat. 
 A handful of recent in-flight incidents since then have raised general concerns about airline safety and put even more pressure on the world's largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners.
 Aviation expert and President of Boyd Group International, Michael Boyd, joined host Dave Anthony this past week to discuss Boeing’s recent issues and whether or not air travel is safe.
Boyd explained what factors could be leading to some of the recent mechanical concerns and why he thinks the FAA needs to be doing more to ensure the safety of passengers.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear more about Boeing’s recent issues. On today’s FOX News Rundown Extra, you’ll hear our entire conversation with aviation expert Mike Boyd.

      <title>From Washington: A Presidential Rematch Is Underway</title>
      <description>Last week, the House voted 352 to 65 to ban TikTok if ByteDance refuses to sell the popular Chinese-owned app. Lawmakers fear that the app is sharing American data with the Chinese Communist Party raising national security concerns. Many teens lobbied for their representatives to vote against the ban, yet it prevailed. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA), spearheaded the vote and joins the podcast to discuss why Washington is pushing for the ban.
It's the rematch that not many voters are excited about - both President Biden and former President Trump have secured the delegates needed to obtain their parties' nominations. The latest FOX News Polls project an uphill battle for President Biden, with former President Trump maintaining a slim lead in key swing states. Co-director of the Fox News Poll and professor at the University of Texas at Austin Daron Shaw looks ahead to the general election and provides his analysis of the tight matchups in Arizona and Pennsylvania. Later, he explains why he anticipates a high voter turnout despite the candidates' low popularity.

      <title>Extra: Jillian Michaels On Weight Loss Drugs And America's Problem With Food</title>
      <description>Weight loss was already a multi-billion dollar industry. Now, anti-obesity drugs that began as treatments for type-two diabetes are beginning to make their mark including Ozempic.
Wegovy, a high-dose version of Ozempic, was the first approved by the FDA for weight loss in 2021, followed by Aepbound, a new version of Mounjaro, last year.
 All the drugs help with hunger by imitating hormones that would normally help regulate appetite after you eat.,  
These drugs got even more attention recently when Oprah announced she was leaving the board of Weight Watchers after disclosing she was using a weight loss medication.
FOX News Rundown host Lisa Brady recently spoke with celebrity fitness trainer Jillian Michaels, who's also a certified nutrition and wellness consultant, best-selling author and businesswoman,
Michael took a deeper dive into the science behind the drugs and the bigger picture of health and wellness including why people are so hungry and the root causes the drugs don't address. 
We made some edits for time and thought you might want to hear the whole thing. On the FOX News Rundown, you will hear our entire conversation with celebrity health expert Jillian Michaels and get even more of her take on America’s obesity problem and the medications being promoted to address

      <title>From Washington: Congress Makes A Move On TikTok </title>
      <description>Numerous developments this week in the chambers of Congress, culminating in a decisive 352-65 vote by the House of Representatives to force a sale or ban TikTok, sending it off to the Senate to make their decision. Meanwhile, Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) disclosed his imminent departure from Congress, adding to the rush of House members departing before the end of their terms. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram and FOX News Congressional Correspondent Aishah Hasnie delve into the intricacies of these unfolding developments.
Earlier this week, President Joe Biden said that Israel would cross a "red line" if they sent troops to the Southern Gaza city of Rafah, resulting in more Palestinian casualties. Democratic support for Israel is shrinking within Washington D.C. and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been too willing to tolerate the casualties in Gaza. FOX News Correspondent Benjamin Hall explains why Democrats are starting to decrease their support for Israel and why some Israelis fear hostages won't make it home.

      <title>Evening Edition: Veteran-Led Group Tries To Evacuate Americans From The Violence In Haiti </title>
      <description>Ultra violent Haitian gangs are continuing their rampage across the island nation, looting the homes of government officials, setting fires and randomly shooting people. The gangs control most of the capital city of Port-au-Prince and the international airport there. The U.S. Marine Corp has sent a special response team to protect the U.S. embassy there and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced this week that he is sending hundreds of soldiers to his shores to stop Haitian migrants from entering.    

FOX's John Saucier speaks with Bryan Stern, who leads Project DYNAMO and is multiple-tour combat veteran of the United States Army and Navy, about the current situation on the ground and his group's efforts to save lives.

      <title>“It’s Personal For These Guys”: Shannon Bream Breaks Down The Long Presidential Race Ahead</title>
      <description>No, it's not déjà vu. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are presumed 2024 rivals, as the two have enough delegates to be nominated at their parties' conventions this summer. However, several states and a few territories still have their primary elections coming up in the next few days. FOX News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream joins the podcast to discuss how former President Trump is benefiting from his legal issues, rumors that Robert F. Kennedy’s running mate shortlist includes NFL quarterback Aaron Rogers, and the House legislation aimed at reeling in TikTok.
With growing concerns about the youth mental health crisis, many are calling into question how parenting styles impact a child's mental well-being. A parenting style that has emerged over the past few decades is "gentle parenting," a form that seeks to avoid punishment, putting the child's feelings above all else. Independent journalist and author of “Bad Therapy: Why the Kids Aren’t Growing Up,” Abigail Shrier joins the FOX News Rundown to discuss why she believes gentle parenting is failing America's children and causing more mental health issues in young people, and shares parenting style tips to keep kids living a structured life.
Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.
Plus, commentary from ambassador for the Leadership Institute’s Riley Gaines Center, Olivia Krolczyk.

        <![CDATA[<p>No, it's not déjà vu. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are presumed 2024 rivals, as the two have enough delegates to be nominated at their parties' conventions this summer. However, several states and a few territories still have their primary elections coming up in the next few days. FOX News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream joins the podcast to discuss how former President Trump is benefiting from his legal issues, rumors that Robert F. Kennedy’s running mate shortlist includes NFL quarterback Aaron Rogers, and the House legislation aimed at reeling in TikTok.</p><p>With growing concerns about the youth mental health crisis, many are calling into question how parenting styles impact a child's mental well-being. A parenting style that has emerged over the past few decades is "gentle parenting," a form that seeks to avoid punishment, putting the child's feelings above all else. Independent journalist and author of “Bad Therapy: Why the Kids Aren’t Growing Up,” Abigail Shrier joins the FOX News Rundown to discuss why she believes gentle parenting is failing America's children and causing more mental health issues in young people, and shares parenting style tips to keep kids living a structured life.</p><p>Don't miss the good news with Tonya J.

      <title>Two Years After Nearly Being Killed In Ukraine, Ben Hall Continues Searching For Heroes</title>
      <description>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has been underway for over two years now, and lawmakers are urging Congress to approve nearly $60 billion of military aid. The bill, however, remains stalled in the House, with many debating the merits of funding this foreign conflict overseas. Today marks two years since FOX News correspondent Benjamin Hall survived a Russian bomb attack in Ukraine that killed two of his colleagues. On the Rundown, he remembers the lives of photojournalist Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian producer Sasha Kushnyova and why journalism can never be silenced, not even in the shadow of war.

The National Health Service of England banned puberty blockers as treatment for children with gender dysphoria, bringing mixed reactions from medical professionals across the globe. The move is a reversal of previous policy in the nation. The NHS justified the controversial move, citing that the safety and effectiveness of puberty blockers are not yet backed by scientific evidence. FOX News contributor and Professor of Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, Dr. Marc Siegel, joins the podcast to share his thoughts on the NHS' decision, what he has seen from studies of gender dysphoria, and how he believes the medical issue should be treated in the future.

Plus, commentary from FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce.

      <title>Evening Edition: Should Illegal Immigrants Be Counted In The Census?  </title>
      <description>As millions of migrants continue to cross the Southern border, Republicans are pushing a bill that would keep noncitizens from being counted on the Census. The Census, taking place every ten years, decides the number of congressional seats in a state and how the federal government distributes billions of dollars in funds. Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TX) offered an amendment to a Senate funding bill last week that would have excluded illegal immigrants form the Census but it failed after 51 Democrats and Independents voted against the measure or were not present.    

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Rich Edson, FOX News Channel senior national correspondent, about the impact of illegal immigrants on the Census.

      <title>Special Counsel Hur Lands In Capitol Hill Hot Seat</title>
      <description>Tuesday's five-hour-long House Judiciary Committee hearing saw Special Counsel Robert Hur placed in the hot seat for his decision to recommend no charges for President Biden's mishandling of classified documents. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle grilled Special Counsel Hur, as comparisons were made between President Biden's and former President Trump's documents cases. FOX News contributor and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy joins the Rundown to discuss key parts of Special Counsel Hur's testimony and why he believes the comparisons between President Biden's case and former President Trump's case are misguided.
In January, an Alaskan Airlines flight made headlines after a door plug blew off during the flight, causing panic and major safety concerns. Following the incident, 33 of the 89 audits conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration failed, propelling Boeing back into the hot seat. Aviation expert and President of Boyd Group International, Michael Boyd, joins the podcast to discuss the recent audits, share why the FAA is also at fault for the manufacturer's oversights, and explain why air travel continues to be the safest mode of transportation in the country.
Plus, commentary from former Vice President Mike Pence.

      <title>Lawmakers Push Bipartisan TikTok Bill: 'Divest From Chinese Ownership, Or Get Banned'</title>
      <description>Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are demanding TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, sell the social media app to an American owner or be banned in the United States. The House will vote on the "Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act" later this week, and teens are now calling their representatives in protest. This is not the first time Congress has proposed such legislation, but it's inching closer to being passed, with President Biden saying he will sign the bill if it makes it to his desk. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) joins the Rundown to explain what this bill would actually mean for TikTok and the national security threat posed by TikTok’s ties to the Chinese Communist Party.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that the next step in his country's efforts to defeat the terror group Hamas is to go after militants in the southern Gazan city of Rafah. However, President Joe Biden says doing so will cross a "red line," publicly warning Netanyahu that the effort could hurt Israel more than it helps. FOX News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst joins the podcast to give the latest developments from inside Tel Aviv, Israel and shares how civilians in Gaza are coping with food insecurity as the Muslims’ sacred holiday of Ramadan begins.
Plus, commentary from host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

        <![CDATA[<p>Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are demanding TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, sell the social media app to an American owner or be banned in the United States. The House will vote on the "Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act" later this week, and teens are now calling their representatives in protest. This is not the first time Congress has proposed such legislation, but it's inching closer to being passed, with President Biden saying he will sign the bill if it makes it to his desk. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) joins the Rundown to explain what this bill would actually mean for TikTok and the national security threat posed by TikTok’s ties to the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that the next step in his country's efforts to defeat the terror group Hamas is to go after militants in the southern Gazan city of Rafah. However, President Joe Biden says doing so will cross a "red line," publicly warning Netanyahu that the effort could hurt Israel more than it helps. FOX News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst joins the podcast to give the latest developments from inside Tel Aviv, Israel and shares how civilians in Gaza are coping with food insecurity as the Muslims’ sacred holiday of Ramadan begins.</p><p>Plus, commentary from host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.</p><p><br></p><p>Photo Credits: Fox News Channel</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Border Crisis Takes Center Stage After State Of The Union</title>
      <description>President Biden delivered his State Of The Union Address last week, highlighting policy achievements and plans for the future, but it was overshadowed by concerns over the crisis at the southern border in the wake of the alleged murder of Laken Riley by an illegal immigrant. This as the Senate weighs taking up an impeachment trial of DHS Secretary Mayorkas for his handling of immigration. Congresswoman Harriet Hageman (R-WY) joins the Rundown to discuss how she would question Secretary Mayorkas if the Senate holds a trial, what she is looking to find out during Special Counsel Hur's public hearing this week regarding President Biden's mishandling of classified documents, and weighs in on why Republicans opposed the Senate's bipartisan border bill. 

Millions are seeking help from what’s become a multi-billion dollar industry: weight loss drugs. From Ozempic to Mounjaro, users are praising the weight-loss effects of these drugs, originally intended to treat type 2 diabetes. Obesity remains an epidemic in America, with CDC data collected in recent years showing four-in-ten U.S. adults are affected by obesity. As these semaglutide drugs remain in the news for helping celebrities like Oprah or Elon Musk, some warn how this could impact one’s health in the long-term. Celebrity fitness trainer and certified nutrition and wellness consultant Jillian Michaels joins the podcast to explain the science behind how these popular drugs curb your hunger, the dangers of relying on medication for fitness, and how our food can make us even hungrier.

Plus, commentary from FOX News Contributor Joe Concha.

      <title>Extra: Should Parents Be Punished For Their Kids' Crimes?</title>
      <description>In a rare case, Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of Oxford High School shooter Ethan Crumble was convicted last month and could face up to fifteen years in prison for her role in the shooting. Prosecutors said she failed to warn authorities about threats her son had made. Now, Ethan’s father, James Crumbley, is also on trial in Michigan for manslaughter.
Shortly after James Crumbley’s trial began, FOX News contributor and George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley joined host Dave Anthony to discuss this unusual case and the legal questions it raises.
Turley explained how the cases against the mother and father differed and explained why he is uncomfortable with the general idea of holding parents legally responsible for the violent actions of their children.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear more about this complicated case. On today’s FOX News Rundown Extra, you’ll hear the entire FOX News contributor and George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley.

      <title>From Washington: As President Touts Economic Record, Most Americans Feel They're Falling Behind</title>
      <description>One of the biggest challenges President Biden faces in his re-election bid is the economy. According to the latest FOX News poll, only 26% of Americans feel optimistic about where the economy stands. In his State of the Union address this past week he tried to reverse that sentiment, touting his record and claiming the U.S. economy is "literally the envy of the world". However, did his words pack a punch for the countless American families who feel they're struggling? Chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors Jared Bernstein discusses why he believes the state of the job market and wage growth are signs of a strong economy, and shares his thoughts on credit card debt being at an all-time high and how President Biden plans to tackle high-interest rates.
Super Tuesday is traditionally the biggest day for the presidential primaries in the United States. This past week, fifteen states and one territory voted for who they wanted to become the eventual presidential nominee. Former President Donald Trump won every state except Vermont, which went for Nikki Haley before she suspended her campaign the following morning. Guy Benson, host of the Guy Benson Show, reacts to Tuesday's results, looks ahead to the general election, and explains why he thinks the State of the Union address was "inappropriately partisan."

      <title>Extra: Why Blue Cities Are Backing Away From Progressive Crime Policies </title>
      <description>There's pushback on some progressive policies lately in liberal strongholds, spurred by crime.
In San Francisco, voters passed two ballot propositions from the city's Democratic Mayor London Breed,  including drug screening and treatment for some city welfare recipients, though sobriety is not a requirement.
The measure also changes police policy and procedure. Officers will now have more leeway to chase someone believed to be committing a felony or violent misdemeanor,  and they can use drones, facial recognition technology, and public surveillance cameras.
In Washington D.C., the city council passed a crime bill that makes it easier for judges to keep certain violent suspects behind bars before trial, expands the definition of carjacking, and creates a new crime for organized retail theft. It also allows DNA collection after arrests--but it's limited to suspects in violent felonies and sexual assault misdemeanors--and only after a judge finds probable cause.
Opponents of these shifts in San Francisco and D.C. have some concerns in common, including a focus on penalties instead of help and the potential for disproportionate impacts on minorities.
Earlier this week, host Lisa Brady spoke to Rafael Mangual, criminal justice expert and the Nick Ohnell Fellow at the Manhattan Institute, about these changes, how effective they may be, and why Democrats across the country are changing their messaging on the crime issue.
Mangual also weighed in on the New York Democratic Governor's decision to deploy hundreds of National Guard members to help crack down on violent crime in New York City’s subways.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear more about this shift in how cities and Blue states are addressing crime. On today’s FOX News Rundown Extra, you’ll hear our entire conversation with criminal justice expert Rafael Mangual.

      <title>From Washington: How The Supreme Court Could Impact the Presidential Race</title>
      <description>Earlier this week, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of former President Trump, keeping him on the ballot in states like Colorado that attempted to disqualify him, arguing he played a role in the January 6th insurrection. Now, the former president is looking ahead to April, when the Supreme Court will hear arguments over whether he is immune from prosecution in his election subversion case. Fox News Chief Legal Correspondent and Anchor of FOX News Sunday Shannon Bream explains the latest opinions out of the High Court and how they could impact the 2024 presidential race.
 
Will TikTok finally be banished? The House Energy and Commerce Committee voted unanimously to advance a bill that would require the app to divest from its Chinese-owned developer or be prohibited in the United States. National security officials have raised concerns about the social media platform, warning a foreign adversary can use the app to surveil its users and collect intelligence. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the legislation, the outcry from young people across the country, and the challenges lawmakers face once this bill officially passes.

      <title>Evening Edition: National Guard Sent To Protect NYC Subways  </title>
      <description>New York State Governor Kathleen Hochul announced this week that members of the National guard and the New York State Police will be bolstering the NYPD to help protect subway stations across the city. The move comes after a spike in violent crimes has plagued the train system in the opening months of the year. Reactions have differed with some saying 'its about time' and others calling for changes to bail reform and the prosecution of criminals as the real answers. 

FOX's John Saucier speaks with CB Cotton, FOX News correspondent based in New York, about the plan, what will the National Guard's role be and reaction to it.

      <title>President Biden Takes Aim At Former President Trump During State Of The Union</title>
      <description>In his State of the Union address, President Biden touted his administration’s accomplishments on everything from revitalizing the U.S. economy to protecting freedom and democracy to prioritizing Americans’ concerns over abortion rights and student loan debt. He highlighted his White House’s policy victories; however, ahead of 2024, many are still critical of his handling of foreign affairs in Afghanistan, Israel, and Ukraine and the chaotic crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. FOX News Audio Politcal Anchor Jared Halpern and FOX News Audio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar joins the Rundown to break down whether President Biden successfully pitched his achievement to the American people, how his speech may have influenced those concerned about the President's age, and the counterpoints aired in Alabama Senator Katie Britt’s Republican response.
 
The 2024 Oscars are this Sunday, and it seems like no surprise to moviegoers and critics alike that the two movies that dominated the big screen this summer are up for a few of the "Big Five" categories. At the 96th Academy Awards, Barbie is one of ten movies nominated for Best Picture, with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer earning a nomination for Best Director. Although "Barbenheimer" remains a cultural phenomenon, John Jurgensen, Style News Desk reporter at the Wall Street Journal, joins the podcast to discuss which actors are likely to take home an Oscar, which films are expected to win, and the movie industry’s growing pains in the age of streaming.
 
Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.
 
Plus, commentary from host of the “Kennedy Saves The World” podcast, Kennedy.

      <title>Evening Edition: Will Israel Expand War With Fight Against Hezbollah In Lebanon?  </title>
      <description>Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant this week said that the rising tensions with Hezbollah at the Lebanese border is bringing them closer to a military escalation against the Iran-backed paramilitary group. A Lebanese newspaper with connections to Hezbollah claims Israel gave them a date of March 15th to stop the cross border attacks or they will begin operations against them. The United States and France have both recently sent diplomats to Beirut to try and calm the situation and prevent a broader conflict.

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with David Daoud, Senior Fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies and Hezbollah expert, who says while Hezbollah gets their marching orders from Iran, Lebanon is also using the terror group to force concessions from Israel.

      <title>A High Stakes State of the Union Address</title>
      <description>This evening, President Joe Biden will deliver the annual State of the Union address. He is expected to focus on the administration's efforts to lower prescription drug prices and protect Americans' access to abortion. However, as he runs for reelection this year, pundits are forecasting the address may sound more like a campaign speech. FOX News contributor and former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, Marc Thiessen, joins the Rundown to share why the President should be concerned about showing his age during the speech and the obstacles he may face in touting his administration’s achievements.
Blue cities across the nation are walking back progressive crime policies and opting for tougher measures to regain public safety. In San Francisco, voters overwhelmingly supported new reforms that hope to curb crime and place restrictions on the city's welfare program. In Washington, D.C., the city council passed the Secure D.C. Omnibus Amendment Act of 2024 to tackle its own crime crisis. Member of the Council on Criminal Justice and Manhattan Institute Fellow, Rafael Mangual, joins the Rundown to discuss how police reform in the wake of the death of George Floyd contributed to crime waves across the country, what these new measures can do to help keep cities safe, and weighs in on New York Governor Kathy Hochul's decision to mobilize the National Guard to New York City.
Plus, commentary by former Congressman Jason Chaffetz, host of the Jason in the House podcast.

      <title>Former President Trump Trounces Ambassador Haley As He Nears Nomination</title>
      <description>Former President Trump won every state except for Vermont on Super Tuesday, solidifying his momentum and presumptive nominee status heading towards the 2024 Republican National Convention. The results have left many pundits questioning whether former U.N. Ambassador Haley will remain in the GOP race. Fox News Radio political analyst Josh Kraushaar and Fox News Audio Washington D.C. Correspondent Jared Halpern join the Rundown to give their analysis of former President Trump’s decisive victory on Tuesday, what’s next for former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, and what President Biden must do to persuade voters ahead of a likely Trump-Biden rematch in 2024.

Last year, Michigan school shooter Ethan Crumbley was sentenced to life in prison without parole for killing four classmates in 2021. In a first-of-its-kind case, a jury will decide if both parents are at fault. His mother, Jennifer Crumbley, was convicted last month and could face up to fifteen years in prison. Her husband, James Crumbley, goes on trial for manslaughter this week. FOX News contributor and George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley joins to discuss how each parent's case differs and the precedent this sets for future cases.

Plus, commentary from the host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Bret Baier on Super Tuesday: 'Trump World vs. Democrats and Independents'</title>
      <description>Today is Super Tuesday, with fifteen contests occurring throughout the United States. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley won her first primary over the weekend, defeating former President Donald Trump in Washington D.C.; however, only two thousand people voted.  Now, all eyes are on the remaining two Republicans in the race after the Supreme Court ruled earlier that Trump's name will appear on ballots nationwide.  FOX's Chief Political Anchor and host of Special Report, Bret Baier, joins the Rundown to preview the contests, break down the Supreme Court's decision, and discuss whether or not President Joe Biden will address voters' concerns about his age.
Even as former President Donald Trump heads into Super Tuesday facing off against his former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, the Trump campaign has shifted focus away from the primary and onto President Biden. The former President has criticized President Biden's handling of Ukraine, Israel, and the economy in recent speeches. With the Republican nomination potentially decided as soon as March 12th, what could lie ahead for the campaign? Trump 2024 National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt joins the podcast to discuss the campaign's feelings heading into Super Tuesday, what issues are most important to former President Trump, and why the campaign has shifted focus toward the general election.
Plus, commentary by FOX News Senior Meteorologist, Janice Dean.

      <title>Evening Edition: SCOTUS Rules 9-0, Former President Can Stay On State Ballots</title>
      <description>In their 9-0 decision, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday that former President Trump cannot be removed from Colorado’s state ballot—or any state ballot for that matter. The High Court unanimously agreed that the 14th Amendment gave states no powers for an “insurrectionist ban” and that states cannot bar candidates from running for federal offices. Former President Trump celebrated the decision on social media, calling it a “big win for America.” University of California at Berkeley Law Professor and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General, John Yoo, joins the podcast to discuss how the Court came to this decision, their expected ruling on presidential immunity, and its implications for the 2024 presidential race.

      <title>As Putin Escalates, How Should The U.S. Respond?</title>
      <description>Headed into Super Tuesday, both President Biden and former President Trump look poised to take their parties respective nominations. With former President Trump gaining momentum in the polls, President Biden is looking to use Thursday's State of the Union address to reset his campaign and silence criticisms that he is too old for a second term. Meantime, Republicans in Congress remain divided about funding for Ukraine and Israel and whether or not they would agree to more foreign spending in exchange for border security measures. For a conversation on this and more, FOX News Chief Washington Correspondent Mike Emanuel is joined by Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK).  

President Grover Cleveland was sworn into office as the twenty-fourth president of the United States 131 years ago today. Cleveland was the only president in history to serve two non-consecutive terms, a feat that former President Donald Trump is now attempting in 2024, as he remains the front-runner in the Republican race. FOX News contributor and former Senior Advisor to President George W. Bush, Karl Rove, joins the Rundown to share the history of President Cleveland's two terms and discuss the similarities between him and former President Trump.

Plus, Commentary from former Senator Scott Brown (R-MA).

      <title>Extra: The Very Real Dangers Of Ultra-Processed Junk Food</title>
      <description>New research out this past week raised an even bigger red flag about junk food and the amount people are eating
The study on "ultra-processed" foods, items that contain numerous ingredients with no nutritional value, found a myriad of health risks for people who consume these products. 
It linked the consumption of common snacks and other products to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, depression, and anxiety. It also cites that nearly 58 percent of all calories consumed by Americans come from ultra-processed items. 
Registered dietitian nutritionist, author, and adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU, Dr. Lisa Young, joined host Lisa Brady on the FOX News Rundown to discuss the study and the risks involved in eating these foods.
Dr. Young discussed why "ultra-processed" foods have become such a big part of the American diet and how people can work on cutting back on them.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear more about this study that highlights the dangers of junk food. On today’s FOX News Rundown Extra, you’ll hear our entire conversation with Dr. Lisa Young and learn more about eating healthy and what diet habits can be helpful.

      <title>From Washington: The Stakes At Hand On Super Tuesday</title>
      <description>Super Tuesday is a few days away, with former President Donald Trump remaining the top Republican competitor. So far, Trump has racked up 182 delegates, and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley only has 24 (and has shown no signs of dropping out). Senior Political Correspondent of National Review and a contributing columnist at the Washington Post, Jim Geraghty, joins to preview Tuesday's contests, share why Trump needs to unite the Republican party and explain why President Joe Biden is less popular today than in 2020. 
President Biden will deliver his third State of the Union address on Thursday night. The President's team is hoping to use the speech as an opportunity to convince voters that he is the stable choice for the country. However, many voters still need to be convinced. The speech will come two days after Super Tuesday, during a high-stakes election year. Co-host of The Five and Democratic Strategist Jessica Tarlov previews the State of the Union and discusses what listeners can expect from the President in terms of messaging and the policies and accomplishments he will likely tout.

      <title>Extra: Should Students Get Paid To Go To School?</title>
      <description>Chronic absenteeism in school has been a growing problem in the U.S. for years. The COVID-19 pandemic only made it worse. Several cities have even attempted programs that incentivize kids to show up to class. 
 
Ohio State Representative Dani Isaacsohn (D-Cincinnati) is co-sponsoring a bill that addresses truancy in his state by paying parents and students for exceptional attendance. 
 
Isaachohn joined the Rundown’s Lisa Brady to explain why he feels that the incentives could help solve Ohio’s education crisis. 
 
The lawmaker discussed attendance programs attempted by other cities and how their results helped them form their proposal. He also addressed the idea’s critics, who say it rewards parents and kids for simply doing what they’re supposed to do.

We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear more about this program to help truancy. On today’s FOX News Rundown Extra, you’ll hear even more from Ohio State Representative Dani Isaacsohn (D-Cincinatti) and his controversial idea to help his state’s education system.

      <title>From Washington: President Biden &amp; Former President Trump Play Blame Game Over The Border</title>
      <description>The battle over who's to blame for the border crisis has intensified following President Biden and former President Trump's simultaneous Texas trips. In Brownsville, President Biden pointed the finger at Republicans for the border crisis, blaming them for border legislation stalling in Washington. Meanwhile, former President Trump went to Eagle Pass, where he put the blame squarely on the President's shoulders -- claiming the uptick in crime committed by illegal immigrants and the lack of control at our border was due to his inaction. Joining live from Brownsville, FOX News Correspondent Griff Jenkins discusses what he's seeing at the border, the uncertain future of impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the likelihood of the President and former President working together.

The longest-serving Senate Leader ever is stepping aside, sending shockwaves across the beltway. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) surprised many this past week by announcing he'll end his historic run at the end of this year, opening the leader spot for the first time since January of 2007. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram reflects on the longest tenure in Senate history.

      <title>Shannon Bream On Trump Immunity Claim, Leader McConnell's Exit, and Super Tuesday</title>
      <description>After a record seventeen years on the job, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnel announced earlier this week that he'd be stepping down from the role in November. Under his leadership, he helped alter the Senate Judiciary, with the Senate confirming three conservative Supreme Court justices under his leadership. FOX News Sunday Anchor and Living the Bream podcast host Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to discuss Senator McConnel's historic decision, former President Donald Trump's Supreme Court case, and what to expect on Super Tuesday.

A new study on "ultra-processed" foods, items that contain numerous ingredients with no nutritional value, is raising an alarm as it found a myriad of health risks for people who consume these products. The study found links to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, depression, and anxiety. It also cites that nearly 58 percent of all calories consumed by Americans come from ultra-processed items. Registered dietitian nutritionist, author, and adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU, Dr. Lisa Young, joins the podcast to discuss the risks involved in eating these foods and how Americans can work on cutting them out of their diet.

Plus, commentary by former Acting U.S. Attorney General, Matt Whitaker.

      <title>Evening Edition: Israel And Hamas Have Differing Accounts On Aid Convoy Deaths   </title>
      <description>Gaza health officials claim that Israeli military forces fired on Palestinians trying to receive humanitarian aid in Gaza. After the accusations, the IDF released an aerial video showing Gazans swarming the aid vehicles which they say caused a stampede. Gaza health officials claim a hundred people were killed and nearly seven hundred injured in the incident.   

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Brent Sadler, Senior Research Fellow at Heritage and expert on Naval Warfare and Advanced Technology, about the 'fog of war' and how it makes determining what happened in an incident like this very hard.

      <itunes:subtitle>Evening Edition: Israel And Hamas Have Differing Accounts On Aid Convoy Deaths   </itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Gaza health officials claim that Israeli military forces fired on Palestinians trying to receive humanitarian aid in Gaza. After the accusations, the IDF released an aerial video showing Gazans swarming the aid vehicles which they say caused a stampede. Gaza health officials claim a hundred people were killed and nearly seven hundred injured in the incident.   

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Brent Sadler, Senior Research Fellow at Heritage and expert on Naval Warfare and Advanced Technology, about the 'fog of war' and how it makes determining what happened in an incident like this very hard.

      <title>Dueling Presidential Border Stops</title>
      <description>Today, both President Biden and former President Trump are set to make visits to the U.S.-Mexico border. Immigration has become a top issue for voters this year, with a recent slew of violent crimes committed by illegal migrants adding urgency to the situation. Many believe President Biden is considering an executive order to help relieve the border crisis; however, the White House has said that no action will be taken following the President's trip to Brownsville, Texas. Senior Contributor at The Federalist Christopher Bedford and former Obama Administration official Jose Aristimuño join to give their perspectives on the two presidents' trip to the Southern border, what messaging each candidate will likely focus on, and what they must do to win over voters on the issue of immigration.
American consumers looking for relief in their wallets got bad news in January, as the numbers show households spent even more on their consumer goods and services. That worse-than-expected CPI report from earlier this month has economists concerned, and that report also revealed an unexpected, painful expense that’s been rising fast…auto insurance. Senior economic analyst at Bankrate, Mark Hamrick, joins the Rundown to explain why insurance rates are spiking now and the crucial mistakes being made by Americans deciding on their budgeting needs. 
Plus, commentary by stand-up comedian Jim Florentine.

      <title>Evening Edition: Sen. McConnell Announces He Is Stepping Down From Senate GOP Leadership  </title>
      <description>Senate Majority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell, history's longest serving leader of the Senate, has announced he will be leaving that position come this November. Senator McConnell, who just turned eighty four, maybe best remembered for blocking President Obama's pick for filling a Supreme court vacancy back in 2016 and shifting lower-courts to a more conservative ideology. And now the question is, who will take his position later this year?   

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Jared Halpern, FOX News Audio Washington correspondent and host of the 'From Washington' podcast, about Senator McConnell's long legacy and who may replace him.

      <title>Hunter Heads To Washington</title>
      <description>Hunter Biden is set to testify today in a closed-door hearing with House Oversight Chair James Comer and House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan leading the questioning about the President's son's overseas business dealings. The case hangs on Republican claims that the Biden family financially gained from selling the "Biden Brand.” They allege that access to then-Vice President Biden was being peddled to foreign business leaders. FOX News Justice correspondent David Spunt joins the Rundown to explain how this hearing will be conducted, what to expect from Hunter Biden's testimony, and the kind of evidence that could be presented during the deposition.
The State Department has recently issued a travel advisory for those looking to visit Mexico; at the same time, national data suggests spring breakers traveling will surge this year. The U.S. has asked travelers to remain vigilant while vacationing, as violent crime has increased in popular vacation destinations. One such instance of violent crime in the Bahamas last month, where two American women were drugged and raped. President of Global Situation Room and former Director of Global Engagement for the Obama administration, Brett Bruen, joins the podcast to explain why travelers must always research their destinations thoroughly, how Americans can stay safe abroad, and the value of registering with the embassy at their destination.
Plus, commentary by former White House speechwriter and Fox News Contributor Marc Thiessen.

      <title>Why Won't Nikki Haley Quit The Race?</title>
      <description>Today is Michigan's primary, where former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley is looking to win a share of delegates, while former President Trump is hoping to build on his already strong lead. The former President continues to call for Haley to drop out of the race after his win in the South Carolina primary, Haley’s home state. Director of the FOX News Decision Desk, Arnon Mishkin, joins the Rundown to discuss the ongoing race for the White House, what he is seeing ahead of the Michigan primary election, and shares his thoughts on why Ambassador Haley has not dropped out of the race.
Florida lawmakers passed a bill last week that would restrict young people’s social media access, which would effectively prohibit those under 16 from accessing Instagram or TikTok. The Supreme Court debated this law on Monday, signaling that some aspects of the bill are unconstitutional. Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Paul Renner, is leading the charge to pass measure HB 1 to ensure Florida protects its children against what he warns are the “harmful and addictive” effects of social media. On the podcast, he explains what protections the bill affords, the negative consequences social media is having on children’s mental and physical health, and how the Florida House is balancing this measure with also protecting parents’ rights.
Plus, commentary by columnist David Marcus.

      <title>Evening Edition: Google Chatbot Answers Cause Concerns Over A-I Bias   </title>
      <description>Google needing to issue another 'mea culpa' after social media users pointed out their chatbot, Gemini, concerning behavior like giving indecisive answers to questions on whether pedophilia was wrong and it refused to show images of White people. This comes after a week where Gemini was said to have given answers and showed images with embarrassing historical inaccuracies. Google continues to remain the most used search engine but how does this impact their A-I ambitions?        

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Kelly O'Grady, FOX Business Network correspondent, who shares the latest accusations the A-I chat is programmed to be bias.

      <itunes:subtitle>Evening Edition: Google Chatbot Answers Cause Concerns Over A-I Bias   </itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Google needing to issue another 'mea culpa' after social media users pointed out their chatbot, Gemini, concerning behavior like giving indecisive answers to questions on whether pedophilia was wrong and it refused to show images of White people. This comes after a week where Gemini was said to have given answers and showed images with embarrassing historical inaccuracies. Google continues to remain the most used search engine but how does this impact their A-I ambitions?        

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Kelly O'Grady, FOX Business Network correspondent, who shares the latest accusations the A-I chat is programmed to be bias.

      <title>Former President Trump Wins Big In South Carolina As Nikki Haley Vows To Continue Campaign</title>
      <description>Former President Trump scored a decisive victory over former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her home state's primary this weekend. Despite the 20-point loss, Haley has vowed to continue her campaign against President Trump, citing the need for younger leadership in government. This while the Senate must conduct the impeachment trial of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the House Oversight Committee continues its ongoing investigation into the Biden family. South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace (R-SC-1) joins the Rundown to discuss why she believes it is time for the GOP to unite behind former President Trump, where she sees the Biden investigation heading, and talks about the challenges Republicans face with such a narrow House majority. 

Surveys estimate that nearly 77 million Americans have a criminal record. Essentially, 1 in every 3 adults has experienced an arrest, conviction, or incarceration. Once folks have served their time and are released, the barriers to re-entering society, like gaining steady employment or affordable housing, can prove extremely difficult. In many states, their criminal record even disqualifies individuals from many opportunities. Vice President at Prison Fellowship Kate Trammell says that there are about 44,000 restrictive federal laws that punish people who have served prison sentences. On the podcast, she explains how reforming these laws will lead to lower crime and better criminal rehabilitation.

Plus, commentary from Co-Host of The Five, and Democratic Strategist Jessica Tarlov.

      <title>Extra: Why Don't Americans Want To Be Police Officers Anymore?</title>
      <description>As cities try to cope with crime across the country, those efforts are being hindered by the nationwide police shortage. In Louisiana, the problem is bad Governor Landry has recently declared a state of emergency to address his state’s severe law enforcement recruitment problem.
Earlier this week, Retired NYPD Inspector and FOX News contributor Paul Mauro joined host Lisa Brady on the FOX News Rundown to discuss what’s causing this officer shortage and potential solutions to their problem.
Mauro also reacted to Police departments who have had to lower recruitment standards in an attempt to drum up interest in becoming a cop.
The conversation was very extensive and we had to make edits for time. On today’s FOX News Rundown Extra, you’ll hear the entire interview with Retired NYPD Inspector and FOX News contributor Paul Mauro about America's police shortage and how politics and the “Defund The Police” movement exacerbated it.

      <title>From Washington: War On Ukraine Enters Third Year</title>
      <description>Saturday, February 24th marked two years since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy remains determined to defeat Russia and continues to request aid and resources from the U.S., urging that a lack of support from President Biden could lead to dire consequences for his country. Though the President announced the U.S. would be implementing more than 500 new sanctions against Russia on Friday, no aid can be sent to Ukraine until a foreign aid package can successfully pass through Congress, which has proven to be a challenge. National security expert Rebecca Grant explains the state of the region two years on. Later, Ukraine’s Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova discusses the important U.S.-Ukraine relationship.
The House has voted to impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, the first time a member of the President's cabinet has faced an impeachment since the 1870s. Republican lawmakers are preparing to hold a full Senate trial holding the Biden administration responsible for the crisis at the Southern Border. However, many Washington insiders believe the Senate will likely acquit Secretary Mayorkas. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram explains how a Senate impeachment trial differs from a presidential one and the political implications it brings for both parties involved.

      <title>Extra: An Alarming New Trend In The Border Crisis </title>
      <description>The crisis at the U.S. southern border has dominated headlines and debates in Washington for years.
However, there has been a shift at the border, with migrants now entering less via Texas and instead illegally crossing through Arizona and California. And that’s not the only big change; Chinese migrants are now the fastest-growing group entering the United States from Mexico. A development that raises even more national security concerns.
FOX News Correspondent Griff Jenkins has been covering the border crisis for years. Earlier this week he joined the Rundown’s Dave Anthony to discuss what he’s seen at the border, the increasing number of illegal Chinese migrants, and his new FOX Nation special, “24/7: Border Crisis.” 
Griff, who has traveled throughout Central and South America and has spoken with many migrants along the way, shared some incredible stories about his time reporting on the issue.
The conversation was very extensive and we had to make edits for time. On today’s FOX News Rundown Extra, you’ll hear the entire interview with FOX News Correspondent Griff Jenkins and get even more of his firsthand knowledge about the border crisis.

While Congress argues over funding for Kyiv, Ukrainian forces continue their brave battle to retain their sovereignty. What is the state of the war now and what is the path to ending it?

      <title>Legal Fights, Student Debt, And Frozen Embryos</title>
      <description>Alabama’s Supreme Court has ruled that frozen embryos are considered children, prompting the 2024 presidential candidates to weigh in on where they stand on the issue of abortion. President Biden condemned the decision as “unacceptable” and vowed to restore the protection of Roe v. Wade under federal law. Former Ambassador Nikki Haley said that to her, an embryo is a life; however, she stressed that we must be careful not to take away access to fertility treatments or IVF. FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to discuss the Alabama Supreme Court ruling on embryos and previews Saturday’s South Carolina primary.
A Massachusetts school is in crisis, with Brockton High School teachers calling on their Governor Maura Healey to send National Guard troops to support them. At an emergency school meeting weeks ago, teachers pleaded with the community to call for action against the students’ rampant fighting, drug use, and reckless behavior. Brockton High School Committee member Tony Rodrigues joins the podcast to describe the dangerous environment of “chaos and violence” among the Brockton High School student body, why they are calling for the Massachusetts National Guard to help support them, and what steps must be taken to make the school safe for students and staff.
Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.
Plus, commentary from FOX News contributor Joe Concha.

      <title>Pundits Question Haley’s Nomination Path, "Where Can She Start Winning?"</title>
      <description>This Saturday, the two remaining Republican presidential candidates will go head-to-head in the South Carolina primary. Former President Donald Trump is expected to leave the Palmetto State victorious, yet former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley plans to stay in the race until Super Tuesday. Trump continues to dominate the polls despite his mounting legal issues, with the first trial slated to begin next month. Yet, Haley isn't thrown off by the numbers. Vice President at Targeted Victory and former Senior Advisor to Tim Scott, Matt Gorman, joins the Rundown to preview this weekend's contest and Haley’s chances at the nomination.

Buyers and sellers across the nation find themselves in a strange predicament, as high mortgage rates have frozen the real estate market, forcing many young folks to rent instead of buy. As the Federal Reserve weighs cutting rates, homebuilders have ramped up production to fill the void left by sellers holding on to their low rates. FOX News Real Estate Contributor Katrina Campins joins the Rundown to discuss the factors that are influencing the housing markets, where young buyers are turning to for solutions, and why she thinks there needs to be a renaissance of affordable housing.

Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of “Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla.”

      <title>Evening Edition: The United States Vetoes Another U.N. Ceasefire Resolution  </title>
      <description>The United States once again vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire to the war in Gaza. The U.S. proposed its own resolution that supported releasing all hostages taken in the Oct. 7th terror attack. The Security Council voted 13-1, Great Britain abstained, on the resolution put forth mainly by Arab countries. 

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Jonathan Schanzer, Senior Vice President for Research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, explains why the U.S. rejected the resolution and what happened to the one suggested by Washington.

      <title>The Evolving Border Crisis</title>
      <description>Lawmakers in Washington are still concerned about the record number of illegal migrants entering the United States through the southern border. However, there has been a shift at the border, with migrants now entering less via Texas and more illegal crossings instead via Arizona and California. Yet, that's not the only big change; Chinese migrants are now the fastest-growing group entering the United States from Mexico. FOX News Correspondent Griff Jenkins joins the Rundown to discuss what he's seen at the border, national security concerns about the increasing number of illegal Chinese migrants, and his new FOX Nation special, "24/7: Border Crisis."

As crime continues to sweep across the nation, the number of police officers on the streets enforcing our laws has sharply declined. In Louisiana, Governor Landry has declared a state of emergency over the lack of officers amid severely lagging recruitment. Police departments have even had to lower recruitment standards in some cases to better drum up interest in donning the badge, but worries over safety and reputation have potential officers hesitant to join. Retired NYPD Inspector and FOX News contributor Paul Mauro joins the podcast to discuss what’s causing this officer shortage, why lowering recruitment standards should concern citizens, and solutions to this crisis.

Plus, commentary by a former investment banker and author of 'You Will Own Nothing,' Carol Roth.

      <title>Navalny Death Sparks International Outrage &amp; Protest Within Russia</title>
      <description>Nearly 400 people were detained across Russia for publicly mourning the death of Alexei Navalny. The Russian opposition leader died in an Arctic prison colony last week. The Kremlin claims Navalny died of sudden death syndrome, yet most Western leaders such as President Biden have argued President Vladimir Putin is responsible for Navalny’s death. Benjamin Hall, senior FOX News correspondent and host of the podcast “Searching for Heroes with Benjamin Hall,” joins the Rundown to explain the current state of affairs in Russia, why Navalny's demise has sparked international outrage, and discuss the war in Ukraine as it approaches two years since Russia invaded.
As the workplace begins to look younger and younger, with Gen Z employees set to soon overtake Baby Boomers in the workforce, concerns persist about where office culture is heading. A viral trend has emerged recently of "Zoomers" filming themselves getting laid off, and posting them on TikTok. This along with remote work demands have employers worried for the future generation of workers. Co-host of The Big Money Show on FOX Business, Taylor Riggs, joins the podcast to discuss Gen Z's workplace etiquette, how artificial intelligence is impacting the world of business, and touches upon inflation’s impact on consumer spending.
Plus, commentary from host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Evening Edition: The White House Has A Russia Problem  </title>
      <description>Secretary of State Antony Blinken attending the Munich Security Conference over the weekend discussed Russia's new nuclear military moves in space with his Chinese and Indian counterparts. The Secretary spoke with the leaders about U.S. relations, Taiwan, the war in Ukraine and the shipping crisis in the Red Sea. This also comes just days after we got word that Russian opposition Alexei Navalny died in prison, something the West blames Putin and his brutal regime for. Meanwhile, Russian forces have captured a city in Eastern Ukraine in their first victory of this kind in many months.   

FOX's Gurnal Scott speaks with Lucas Tomlinson, FOX News correspondent based in Washington D.C., about the growing calls to act against Russia in response to the latest events.

      <title>The House Weighs Foreign Aid &amp; Mayorkas Impeachment Shifts To The Senate</title>
      <description>The Senate's foreign aid package arrives in the House this week, where it is expected to face opposition from Republicans, after Speaker Mike Johnson stated that he would not consider bringing the bill to the floor. This as Department Of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' impeachment process moves forward to the Senate. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN-3) joins the Rundown to discuss the Senate foreign aid bill, what he expects to come out of the impeachment trial of Secretary Mayorkas, and shares what can be done to secure the southern border. 

Monday is Presidents Day, a time for Americans to honor and celebrate the leaders who helped shape the nation. However, many people focus on what the president is doing while in the White House, but what happens when they leave office? On the Rundown, President of Global Affairs at Goldman Sachs and former advisor to two secretaries of state, Jared Cohen, shares details from his new book “Life After Power,” which explores seven presidents and their search for a purpose beyond the White House.

Plus, commentary by author and vice president of communications for Focus on The Family, Paul Batura.

      <title>Extra: The Targeting Of Gun Transactions</title>
      <description>For years, Second Amendment advocates have long raised concerns about both the government and the public sector collecting and tracking gun purchase data. They say this is a privacy issue and a pathway to deny people their rights to own a weapon or target gun owners legally.
 
The state of California recently passed a law that says banks and credit card companies must assign merchant category codes to firearm sellers by May of next year so they can flag suspicious activity and alert law enforcement. 
 
Members of Congress have also recently raised alarms over reports the Treasury Department is conducting surveillance on gun owners.
On the FOX News Rundown this week, Jessica Rosenthal spoke with Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, who has been outspoken about his opposition to such practices and why tracking gun purchases is a violation of the law. 

Jessica also spoke with former ATF Senior Executive Scott Sweetow about how effective a database on gun purchases could be when trying to stop gun trafficking and mass shooters.

We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversations with both guests. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more from Montana AG Austin Knudsen and former ATF agent  Scott Sweetow about gun data collection and whether or not that information would a helpful tool for law enforcement.

      <title>From Washington: Speaker Johnson's Job Continues To Get Harder</title>
      <description>Former Congressman Tom Suozzi will return to the House after defeating Republican Mazi Pilip in a special election held in New York last week, flipping the seat to the Democrats. He will fill the vacancy left by the expulsion of Republican George Santos. Politico Reporter Olivia Beavers examines what parties can learn from last Tuesday's results and how Souzzi's win could impact the politics and policies coming out of Capitol Hill.
No matter how hard you try to avoid them, you will be inundated with campaign and PAC ads every election cycle. Some get more attention than others. A $7 million ad for Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. created some buzz this week after it aired during last Sunday’s game. Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley's campaign placed a $4 million ad buy in South Carolina as she hopes to keep her campaign alive. But does all that money poured into ads pay off?  FOX News Contributor and former Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush Karl Rove discusses the efficacy of political advertising and explains the types of voters they're aimed toward.

      <title>Extra: Dana Perino And Dan Senor Return To Discuss Israel And The Biden-Netanyahu Relationship</title>
      <description>Dan Senor is a former Bush White House foreign policy adviser, the host of the podcast 'Call Me Back', and the author of the book, "The Genius of Israel The Surprising Resilience of a Divided Nation in a Turbulent World." 

FOX News' Dana Perino first spoke with Dan on the Fox News Rundown back in November, just weeks after Hamas' brutal terror attacks against Israel on October 7th. Back then, the two discussed the country's unique history and its resilience. 

Dana wanted to sit down with him again this past week to get his take on the ongoing war, his recent trip to Israel, and if the country remained as determined as ever to defeat Hamas as it did last fall. 

In the segment that ran earlier this week, Dana and Dan also talked about the threat from Iran and the growing pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to free the remaining hostages and end the war. 

The conversation was very extensive and we had to make edits for time. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear the entire discussion between Dana Perino and former Bush White House foreign policy adviser Dana Perino about the war in Israel and the politics that surround it.

      <title>From Washington: Why Russia Is Upping The Ante</title>
      <description>A wave of alarming news came out of Russia this past week. On Friday, we learned of the death of Kremlin opposition leader Alexei Navalny at a Russian prison colony. And just days before that, a cryptic warning about an emerging Russian space-based threat from the House Intelligence Committee chairman sparked major concern in Washington and across the country. Retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg joins to discuss how he believes the West should respond to these alarming developments, and how they could impact the debate over Ukraine funding and America's commitment to the NATO alliance.  
Earlier this week, the House narrowly voted 214 to 213 to impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, highlighting the GOP's continued efforts to hold the Biden administration responsible for the growing crisis at the southern border. This historic event marks the first time in nearly 150 years a cabinet secretary has been impeached. However, it is expected Mayorkas will acquitted by the Senate as many Democrats argue that the GOP's actions are nothing more than a political stunt. FOX News Congressional Correspondent Aishah Hasnie joins to explain how Republicans were able to pull off this week's historic vote.

      <description>On Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified at a hearing about her prosecution of former President Donald Trump and many others connected to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream joined the Rundown to discuss this case and others that former President Trump is facing. Later, she explains National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's comments about a pressing national security threat and Russia's reported pursuit of nuclear weapons in space.

Over the past decades, heart disease and related ailments have been on the rise in the United States, bringing heart health to the forefront. Associate Director for Structural and Congenital Heart at Hackensack University Medical Center, Dr. Craig Basman, joins the Rundown to discuss the basics of understanding what makes a healthy heart, how to monitor your cardiovascular wellness, and what things to avoid if you are predisposed to heart conditions.

      <title>A Balance Of Power Bellwether? </title>
      <description>The Republican majority in the House has one less seat after Tuesday’s special election in New York’s 3rd congressional district saw Democrat Tom Suozzi elected to replace former Congressman George Santos. Congressman-elect Souzzi previously lost to Santos in 2022 after serving three terms. Once sworn in, his presence in Congress will bring the balance of power to a slim two-seat Republican majority. FOX News Radio's political analyst Josh Kraushaar joins to break down whether or not this special election could be an accurate predictor of what's to come in November and why Suozzi’s victory may serve as a lesson for the White House’s 2024 playbook.

      <title>"A Right To Privacy": Credit Cards Companies To Track Gun Purchases</title>
      <description>American Express, Visa, Mastercard, and other major credit card companies will soon allow banks to monitor customer firearm and ammunition purchases, potentially allowing these companies to flag suspicious purchases and report them to law enforcement. Supporters of the law—currently in effect in California and being weighed in other states—say this will help identify suspicious purchase patterns to stop mass shootings, but Second Amendment proponents would have their privacy infringed upon. On the Rundown, retired ATF executive Scott Sweetow and Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen join to discuss what this law means for the rights of gun owners, their privacy, and the "precarious position" it puts these private companies in.
Inflation isn't coming down as quickly as economists predicted. However, it is not nearly as high as it once was, with White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre telling reporters that the Biden administration is working to bring it down even more. Yet, many Americans still feel like they are still paying more for everyday goods and putting more necessities on their credit cards. Senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and Trump 2024 campaign adviser, Stephen Moore, joins the Rundown to discuss how inflation continues to impact the country and explain why many Americans are finding themselves in a dangerous debt cycle.
Plus, commentary by Jason Rantz, Host of the Jason Rantz Show and author of "What's Killing America."

According to a report from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, thousands of migrants from dozens of different countries have been apprehended since last October. Two migrants detained in Maine, just months ago, were flagged as "Transnational Criminal Organized Crime matches."  

FOX's John Saucier speaks with FOX's Molly Line, Boston -based correspondent for the FOX News Channel, about the increasing number of migrants crossing our northern border.

      <title>Is The President's Israel Support Waning?</title>
      <description>It has been 129 days since Hamas' deadly terror attack on Israel, which left nearly 1200 Israelis dead and hundreds taken hostage, along with American citizens. As the Israeli Defense Force plans its offensive into the Gazan city of Rafah, believed to be the final stronghold for Hamas terrorists, the Biden administration is catching criticism over the President's comments on Israel's military activity in Gaza. Former foreign policy adviser to President George W. Bush, author of “The Genius of Israel,” and host of the ‘Call Me Back’ podcast, Dan Senor, joins the Rundown to discuss what he has seen on the ground in Israel, his assessment of the Biden administration's handling of the escalating conflict, and talks about widespread fears within America’s Jewish community.
New York's third congressional district is holding a special election Tuesday for ex-Congressman George Santos' vacant House seat in the state's wealthiest district. Redistricting has caused NY-3 to become slightly blue in the very red suburbs of Manhattan. Former Democratic Representative Tom Suozzi is looking to reclaim the district after losing it to Santos in 2022. However, Republican candidate and Nassau County legislator Mazi Pilip is running for the empty seat despite her opponent's continuous claim that she is “Santos 2.0.” Pilip joins the Rundown to discuss her campaign, her belief that Democrats have failed the NY-3 voters in the past, and her nuanced position as a pro-life candidate who stands against a national abortion ban.

      <title>President Biden's Mental Capabilities Spark Republican Calls For 25th Amendment </title>
      <description>The release of Special Counsel Hur's report on President Biden's mishandling of classified documents, has sparked new age concerns and calls from Congressional Republicans for the invoking of the 25th Amendment. This while Israel continues its combat of Hamas forces in Gaza and the House gets ready for another impeachment vote for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Congressman Clay Higgins (R-LA-3) joins the Rundown to discuss his view on President Biden's leadership during the crisis in the Middle East, where he stands on calls to invoke the 25th Amendment, and what he believes needs to be done to secure the Southern Border. 

It's almost Valentine's Day, and a lot of people are on their phones looking for love. A recent Forbes poll says that 70% of people who use dating apps have found "the one." However, not everyone is so lucky. Unfortunately for them, places like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge seem to be the only way to find romance these days. Dating coach Damona Hoffman joins the Rundown to discuss how dating apps have changed relationships and our culture. She also explains why some people are afraid to meet others "in real life" and why discussing politics on the first date is no longer taboo.

Plus, commentary from Columnist and Author David Marcus.

      <itunes:summary>The release of Special Counsel Hur's report on President Biden's mishandling of classified documents, has sparked new age concerns and calls from Congressional Republicans for the invoking of the 25th Amendment. This while Israel continues its combat of Hamas forces in Gaza and the House gets ready for another impeachment vote for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Congressman Clay Higgins (R-LA-3) joins the Rundown to discuss his view on President Biden's leadership during the crisis in the Middle East, where he stands on calls to invoke the 25th Amendment, and what he believes needs to be done to secure the Southern Border. 

It's almost Valentine's Day, and a lot of people are on their phones looking for love. A recent Forbes poll says that 70% of people who use dating apps have found "the one." However, not everyone is so lucky. Unfortunately for them, places like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge seem to be the only way to find romance these days. Dating coach Damona Hoffman joins the Rundown to discuss how dating apps have changed relationships and our culture. She also explains why some people are afraid to meet others "in real life" and why discussing politics on the first date is no longer taboo.

Plus, commentary from Columnist and Author David Marcus.

      <title>Extra: The High Stakes Of Legal Sports Betting</title>
      <description>Sports gambling is a big business and only getting bigger. But as more states legalize it and wagering apps are more readily available, there is a concern that many Americans are unprepared for how addictive sports betting can be.

This week on the FOX News Rundown, host Lisa Brady spoke with recovering gambling addict, and internationally certified gambling counselor Harry Levant about how betting cost him almost everything including his life. Levant was incredibly transparent about his past problems and what he's now doing to help people avoid the dangers of gambling.

For that story, Lisa also spoke to Diana Goode, Executive Director of the Connecticut Council for Problem Gambling, who is working to help both addicts and their families cope with the addiction. Goode offered advice to those who may be addicted and suggested ways for the government to regulate these popular apps and prevent people from ruining their lives.

Due to time limitations, we were only able to air short clips of Lisa's interview with Goode in our original segment. However, she offered some very helpful information for anyone seeking help. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the entire incredible conversation with Connecticut Council for Problem Gambling Executive Director Diana Goode and learn more about the risks that come with the rise of sports gambling.

      <title>From Washington: Special Counsel Findings Raise Concerns About President Biden</title>
      <description>A Special Counsel report released last Thursday may have let President Biden off the hook legally but raised questions about his mental competency that now have many Americans more concerned about his age. Former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Andy McCarthy shares what he finds strange about the special counsel's legal findings and discusses key points from the oral arguments at the Supreme Court over former President Donald Trump's eligibility to be on the ballot in Colorado.

Former President Trump won the Nevada Caucus, securing the state's 26 delegates. Despite her name being on the ballot for the Nevada Primary, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley lost to the 'None of the candidates' option by over 30 points. Still, the former Governor insists she's staying in the race through Super Tuesday. And though President Biden won the Democratic primary in Nevada, he's now facing questions about his age and mental acuity. Co-host of America's Newsroom Bill Hemmer discusses the current state of the presidential primary and how events that unfolded this past week could impact the road to Super Tuesday.

      <title>Extra: Will Cain Has A Warning For The NFL</title>
      <description>The Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers are facing off in Las Vegas tomorrow at Super Bowl LVIII. A rematch of the big game four years ago, some are predicting Sunday will be the highest-rated Super Bowl of all time.

Will Cain, host of The Will Cain Show and FOX and Friends Weekend, will be there covering the game for FOX News.

Earlier this week, Will Cain joined host Chris Foster on the FOX News Rundown to preview the matchup and discuss the hype surrounding the weekend, and America's love for football.

Cain also weighed in on one of tomorrow's biggest narratives: Taylor Swift's relationship with the Chiefs' star tight end Travis Kelce. While professional football has never seemed bigger, thanks in part to the pop star, FOX News' Will Cain warned the NFL needs to be careful about turning off their fans with too much 'Swifty' pandering.

We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Will Cain. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more of Will Cain's takes on the Super Bowl, the NFL ... and Taylor Swift.

      <title>From Washington: Back To Square One For Lawmakers </title>
      <description>After a bipartisan border bill was blocked on the Senate floor this week, lawmakers on Capitol Hill may be working through the weekend to pass a foreign aid package without border security. With questions as to whether this bill was doomed from the start, Congress is back to the same drawing board they faced in the fall of 2023. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram and Congressional Correspondent Aishah Hasnie discuss House Majority Leader Mike Johnson's political bind and ponder how he will handle putting a new bill on the House floor.
﻿The latest report from the Congressional Budget Office shows that the Social Security Old Age and Survivor's Trust Fund will run out of money by 2033. Last year, President Biden continuously alleged that Republicans wanted to cut entitlements. However, former President Donald Trump says that cutting Social Security is unnecessary because natural resources like oil and gas will cover the cost. President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Maya MacGuineas weighs in on the future of Social Security and why candidates are not telling the truth about what lies ahead for the program.

      <title>The Age-Old Question About President Biden</title>
      <description>President Biden has come under new scrutiny after Special Counsel Robert Hur released his report on POTUS' mishandling of classified documents. While the special counsel will not issue any criminal charges, the report revealed that the President seemed confused and forgetful during questioning and described him as an "elderly man with a poor memory." President Biden's attorneys have disputed these descriptions, requesting that Special Counsel Hur amend the characterization of the President. Anchor of FOX News Sunday and the Livin' The Bream podcast Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to discuss the Special Counsel report, how it could damage the Biden 2024 campaign, and shares her insight on the Supreme Court hearing arguments in former President Trump's election case against the state of Colorado.
The Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers are going head-to-head in Las Vegas this weekend in the Super Bowl...a rematch of the big game four years ago. Host of The Will Cain Show and FOX and Friends Weekend, Will Cain, joins to discuss who he thinks is favored to win and why he believes the NFL needs to be cautious about how much Taylor Swift they show during the game. Later, he weighs in on how sports gambling has begun to more accurately predict game outcomes and why he is excited to bring his son to the game.
Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.
Plus, commentary from FOX News contributor Joe Concha.

      <title>Evening Edition: Why Two GOP Contests In Nevada? </title>
      <description>First, it was a primary in Nevada and now there is a caucus in the state where Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are battling for support. But neither candidate was in both political contests because rules in the state only allow you to enter one or the other. So, why two contests and how important is either for the remaining two big name GOP candidates?
FOX's John Saucier speaks with Alicia Acuna, FOX News Senior Correspondent in Las Vegas covering the caucuses, who says legal and political disputes made this happen.

      <title>Oregon's Overdose Crisis...After Decriminalizing Drugs</title>
      <description>In 2020, Oregon voters became the first state to largely decriminalize drug use and small amounts of hard drugs like cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl. Lawmakers pitched Measure 110 as a progressive, fresh approach to helping treat addiction rather than punish it, and the law passed with 58 percent support. Oregon's governor recently declared a drug emergency, as overdose deaths have been climbing year after year and Democratic lawmakers who first pushed to decriminalize drugs are admitting it isn't working. Oregon State Representative Kevin Mannix is a Republican who opposed the measure, and he joins the Rundown to explain how drug decriminalization has caused a rise in overdoses, why drug traffickers are now targeting Oregon, and what he believes could be a compassionate solution to help addicts while keeping drugs off the streets in his state.

Although he is facing several criminal trials this year, former President Donald Trump remains the Republican frontrunner in the race for commander-in-chief. He continues to allege that the legal proceedings are a form of election interference, with one case making it to the Supreme Court. Today, the Justices will consider his appeal to a Colorado Supreme Court ruling that could disqualify him from the Centennial State's primary ballot for participating in an insurrection on January 6th. FOX News Legal Editor, Kerri Urbahn, joins to break down the legal questions at play in this decision and what this unprecedented case could mean for the election.

Plus, commentary by columnist and co-author of "Stolen Youth," Bethany Mandel.

      <title>Evening Edition: Florida Schools Seeing Benefits From Cell Phone Bans  </title>
      <description>Florida lawmakers enacted a law that requires public schools to prohibit cell phone use during school hours or “instructional time” and they are seeing the benefits from it. Schools that are putting in more extreme rules that include confiscation of phones if they are seen using them have seen spikes in focus and engagement while seeing drops in bullying.
FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Danamarie Mcnicholl, Miami correspondent for FOX News, about the ban and how school officials and parents are reacting to it.

      <title>Long-Negotiated Border Bill Declared "Dead On Arrival"</title>
      <description>Late Sunday night, the Senate revealed the text for their long-negotiated bipartisan border bill. Supporters of the legislation say that it will stem the record flow of migrants into the United States while ending most catch-and-release cases. House Speaker Mike Johnson has called the bill "dead on arrival," pointing out flaws in the text and calling out President Biden to take executive action on the crisis. President of the National Border Patrol Council Brandon Judd joins the Rundown to discuss why the Border Patrol Union has endorsed the bill, what the changes in immigration law can do to limit the number of migrants entering the country, and what he has seen at the border in recent days.
The FBI continues to assert that China poses the most significant threat to the nation's homeland security. Last week, Director Christopher Wray testified before the House, saying that the Chinese government continues to target key aspects of U.S. infrastructure. These attacks are being launched online, but they pose real-world threats to American citizens, potentially hindering the country's water supply or electrical grid. Founder and CEO of Applied AI Company, John Cofrancesco, joins to explain how China could gain access to U.S. infrastructure, the state of the nation's cyber defenses, and why we should still be wary of TikTok.
Plus, commentary by Fox Nation host and country music star, John Rich.

      <title>Evening Edition: Migrant Suspects In NYPD Attack Arrested, One Indicted  </title>
      <description>Three men have been tracked down and arrested in Arizona in connection with the violent beating of New York City police officers in Times Square. Also, on Tuesday, a grand jury indicted one of the suspects in the attack. Meanwhile, in comments not made before in other controversial criminal cases, Governor Hochel seems to have made a swipe at NYC DA Alvin Bragg for letting the suspects go without bail.   

FOX's John Saucier speaks with Paul Mauro, attorney, former NYPD inspector and co-founder of ‘Ops Desk’, who says the suspects escape could have been avoided and it all reeks of politics.

      <title>When Sports Gambling Costs You Everything</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/02/06/when-sports-gambling-costs-you-everything/</link>
      <description>It is primary day in Nevada; however, the contest won't count toward deciding the Republican nominee. The state's GOP leaders decided to instead award its delegates in caucuses being held Thursday. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will appear on the state's primary ballot today but is essentially forfeiting Thursday's contest to former President Donald Trump. If you're confused, you're not alone. Pollster and President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter, joins the Rundown to explain what's happening in Nevada and breaks down the state of the 2024 presidential election.

In recent years, sports betting has become a billion-dollar industry throughout the country, as more and more states make the move to legalize the use of mobile apps to place wagers on sporting events. With accessibility on the rise, so is the number of gambling addicts, with new research showing more than half of college aged adults having placed bets on mobile apps. Recovering gambling addict, and internationally certified gambling counselor Harry Levant joins to share how his addiction nearly drove him to take his own life, discuss the flaws in the industry and why they fail to protect the consumer, and what he would like to see done to regulate sportsbooks.

Plus, commentary from Vice President &amp; General Counsel at Net Choice Carl Szabo.

      <title>Evening Edition: Republicans Rally In Opposition To Border Bill </title>
      <description>Over a dozen GOP senators have expressed their opposition to a bipartisan Senate deal that includes border security and aid to Ukraine and Israel. A major snagging point is that the bill give President Biden the power to nullify the law. While the bill needs sixty votes to pass, many view it as dead on arrival. 

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Chad Pergram, senior congressional correspondent for FOX News, who says while things could change, this bill doesn't look like it will survive.

      <title>Nation Copes With Migrant Crisis As Congress Weighs Options</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/02/05/nation-copes-with-migrant-crisis-as-congress-weighs-options/</link>
      <description>December 2023 saw a record number of illegal immigrants crossing the border, with over 300,000 reported encounters. As the crisis continues, Congress is weighing legislation to address the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the United states. Congressman Tony Gonzales (R-TX-23) joins the Rundown to discuss how the crisis has impacted his district, what the Biden Administration can do to help secure ports of entry, and shares his thoughts on the Administration's response to Iran proxy attacks in the Middle East.
Despite a surprisingly good January jobs report and other recent positive data, many Americans are still anxious about the economy. 40% of voters say they are falling behind financially as the cost of essentials remains higher than a few years ago. Co-host of the Big Money Show on Fox Business, Taylor Riggs, joins the Rundown to discuss why so many people find it hard to trust the data and still feel squeezed. However, she also explains why she doesn't think the country is heading toward a recession.
 
Plus, commentary from FOX News Contributor Tammy Bruce.

      <title>Extra: The Fight To Hold Social Media Companies Accountable</title>
      <description>This past week we spoke to New Mexico's Attorney General Raul Torrez. He traveled to Washington DC to watch the Senate Judiciary Committee's Big Tech hearing in person. There the senators heard from some of the biggest social media company CEOs in the business about their policies or lack of them regarding child safety on their platforms.

While most of the CEOs were highly defensive, there was one blockbuster moment during which Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley prompted Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to apologize to the dozens of parents seated behind him whose children had either been harmed online or committed suicide after cyberbullying or being sexually extorted.

The CEOs of Discord, Meta, TikTok, Snapchat, and X, formerly known as Twitter, tried to sound open to new legislation, but when asked point blank if they were open to specific existing proposed legislation most would not support the five bills already out there.

Torrez is suing Meta for failing to remove child sexual abuse material. Before he was AG Torrez successfully prosecuted violent and sexual crimes and served in the Obama Department of Justice.

We did not get to air this during the week so we'll play the full interview here on the FOX News Rundown Extra. You will hear his take on why he thinks big tech should be held legally accountable for failing to protect children from their products.

      <title>From Washington: Attitudes Changes Towards U.S. Economy </title>
      <description>As Americans settle into the new year, it seems the majority are feeling better about the economy — as spending increases and consumer sentiments become more positive, according to researchers. This, combined with a low unemployment rate and a burst of new jobs in the market, indicates high inflation could soon be a thing of the past. However, as the Federal Reserve holds interest rates at a record high, how long will it be until Americans begin to feel true relief after years of unprecedented prices? FOX Business White House Correspondent Edward Lawrence shares why Fed Chair Jerome Powell is choosing to keep interest rates the same for yet another month and how the economy is playing a role on the 2024 campaign trail.
Last month, the Supreme Court lifted an order by the Court of Appeals saying that border patrol agents cannot interfere with razor wire Texas installed along the border, except in medical emergencies. Because thousands of migrants enter the United States every day, the Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, said that the state would not stop putting up razor wire. Governor Greg Abbott calls the crisis an invasion, accusing the federal government of failing to protect his state. George Washington University Law School Professor Jonathan Turley describes the tense legal battle between the state and federal government.

      <title>Extra: Dana Perino Talks 'New Normals', Old Presidents, And Our Volatile World With Jared Cohen</title>
      <description>Jared Cohen is President of Global Affairs at Goldman Sachs, a bestselling author of five books, and a former advisor to two Secretaries of State: Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton
Because of Jared's impressive background, FOX News' Dana Perino wanted to speak with him on the FOX News Rundown about the ongoing conflicts in the Mideast, the three U.S. soldiers killed in a drone attack in Jordan last weekend, and other issues facing the United States and the world.
Jared shared why he believes Iran is creating a dangerous 'new normal' in the region and why the pandemic distracted America's intelligence community from the threat of global terror.
Dana and Jared also spoke about his upcoming book, "Life After Power: Seven Presidents And Their Search For Purpose Beyond The White House," which delves into the lives of several Presidents after they left the Oval Office.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear Dana Perino's entire conversation with international policy expert Jared Cohen. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more about Jared's take on world affairs, plus more about his career and his unique perspective on life.

      <title>From Washington: Can The U.S. Avoid A War In The Middle East?</title>
      <description>After three U.S. soldiers were killed during a drone attack on a base located in Jordan, the United States carried out retaliatory airstrikes against Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq Friday evening. Amid increasing global tensions, questions remain as to whether our military is prepared and capable to handle a war in the Middle East. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense and Co-founder of the Marathon Initiative Eldridge Colby examines whether a greater conflict can be avoided. Later, he reflects on Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's health emergency and how it reflects on our military readiness.

This week, the House Homeland Security Committee approved two articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, accusing the Biden administration's top border and immigration official of overlooking and refusing to enforce federal laws. Meanwhile, tensions build as lawmakers struggle to agree on a bipartisan border bill, a bill that they've waited for since December. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram shares the possible next steps to all unanswered congressional questions.

      <title>Evening Edition: Better Than Expected Jobs Report, Is It Believable?</title>
      <description>The January jobs report showed that over 350K jobs were added last month, above the 180K jobs expected, but wage inflation did rise and labor force participation has declined. Also, planned layoffs did jump 136% from December with the layoffs mostly impacting tech and finance industries. Now we wait to see if the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting in March. 

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Chris Markowski, financial analyst and host of 'The Watchdog on Wall Street' podcast, who says he is not buying the numbers.

      <title>White House "Desperate" For Border Solution As Congress Negotiates Deal</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/02/02/white-house-desperate-for-border-solution-as-congress-negotiates-deal/</link>
      <description>After months of negotiations, the Senate's new bipartisan bill aimed to reduce the surge of migrants at the southern border is now threatened by former President Trump. Trump has been publicly shaming the deal and urging lawmakers to oppose it, saying the plan is stupid. As lawmakers continue to pressure the Biden administration into taking action, the president says he has done all he can do to secure the border. FOX News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream weighs in on the border debate and how it’s impacting the 2024 presidential race. 
 
It has been one year since the Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. The derailment caused soil and ground water contamination throughout the area, and the response by the EPA and Biden Administration was widely criticized by residents of the town. Ohio State Senator Michael A. Rulli represents the district and joins the Rundown to discuss what East Palestine looks like a year out from the accident, how the chemical spill impacted the health and safety of residents, and what he would like to see from the Biden administration to help fix the lasting effects of the catastrophe.
 
Plus, commentary from New York Post Columnist and author of the book "Stolen Youth" Karol Markowicz.

      <description>The big game is right around the corner and securing the site has been in the works for quite some time now. The NFL's Super Bowl is always considered a 'SEAR level 1', meaning it always receives the highest ranking security level. Besides local and state law enforcement the game will be being monitored by artificial intelligence that will aid humans in making sure everyone is safe. 

FOX's John Saucier speaks with Peter Evans, CEO of 'Xtract One Technologies', about this technology and how it is used to secure all types of gatherings.

      <title>Senators Clash With Tech CEOs Over Children's Online Safety</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/02/01/senators-clash-with-tech-ceos-over-childrens-online-safety/</link>
      <description>The CEOs of prominent tech and social media companies appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, addressing the Senate Judiciary Committee's Child Online Safety hearing. Senators from both sides of the aisle clashed with CEOs on what measures they are taking to ensure underage user's safety from sex trafficking and cyberbullying. Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) joins the Rundown, to discuss her bi-partisan proposal, the Kids Online Safety Act, what she thought of the tech CEOs' testimonies, and explains how Congress can step in to regulate social media companies.
 
ABC Shark Tank personality and business tycoon Mark Cuban has come under fire this week for comments regarding corporate America's diversity, equity, and inclusion practices. Cuban took to X to say he would use race and gender as a factor when hiring if it puts his business in the best position to succeed. Although the debate surrounding DEI is not new, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says his comments are dead wrong. Andrea Lucas, a commissioner for the EEOC, joined the Rundown to break down the intentions behind DEI and explain why some confuse equity and equality.
 
Plus, commentary from former Texas Governor Rick Perry.

      <title>Evening Edition: House Republicans Advance Historic Impeachment Of Sec. Mayorkas  </title>
      <description>The House Committee on Homeland Security voted to approve articles of impeachment for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. A cabinet secretary has not been impeached in the United States for nearly one hundred fifty years. If the full House, with the GOP having just a two vote majority, passes the articles it will force the Senate start a trial.
FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Chad Pergram, senior congressional correspondent for FOX News, who explains the historic significance of this and the politics of impeachment.

      <title>'This City Has Failed Us': Rampant Crime &amp; Fed-Up Residents</title>
      <description>Imagine your boss telling you it’s so dangerous outside the office that you should not go outside your place of work to get lunch or coffee. That life has been a reality for residents and workers in Oakland, California, where the largest private employer in the city, Kaiser Permanente, issued a memo to workers warning them about the safety risks due to the area’s rampant crime. Crime has surged in Oakland, and many community members don’t believe that the city’s Mayor Sheng Thao or Alameda County’s District Attorney Pam Price are offering meaningful solutions. In fact, there is an effort to recall both of them. On the Rundown, founder of the Neighbors Together Oakland nonprofit Seneca Scott explains how he is fighting to restore safety to his beloved community, what is motivating residents to push for recall efforts, and he details exactly how Oakland became so plagued with crime.
Over the weekend, Neuralink, Elon Musk's neurotechnology company, implanted a brain chip into its first human subject. The company launched in 2016 and aims to "restore autonomy to those with unmet medical needs." Although this is not first-of-its-kind technology, famous scientist Stephen Hawking used a computer to communicate after being paralyzed by ALS. The company decided to move forward with human subject testing despite calls from Congress to investigate reports of negative effects on monkeys. Many believe that with this tech, Musk may be on the brink of a medical breakthrough. Rolfe Winkler, digital health reporter for The Wall Street Journal, joins to talk about how the technology works, how it will help paralyzed individuals, and how Elon Musk plans to advance the technology to compete with artificial intelligence.
Plus, commentary by Arnon Mishkin, FOX News Decision Desk Director.

      <title>Evening Edition: How Will The U.S. Respond To Deadly Drone Attack In Jordan?</title>
      <description>President Biden has promised to respond to the deadly drone attack by an Iranian-proxy group that killed three American soldiers and injured more than forty. The investigation into who is responsible for the attack continues regardless of an Iranian-backed proxy in Iraq taking credit for the attack. The attack has led to calls for a direct response to Iran and it could become a defining moment for President Biden.
FOX's John Saucier speaks with Jennifer Griffin, senior national security correspondent for FOX News, about what we know about the attack and what could a response from Washington look like?

      <title>"Pushing The Redlines": How Iran Proxy Attacks Became The "New Normal"</title>
      <description>Over the weekend, three U.S. soldiers were killed in a drone attack in Jordan, which was carried out by an Iranian proxy group. With the Israel-Hamas war at an impasse, lawmakers agree Iran's hostilities will soon require American retaliation. Special guest host Dana Perino sat down with Jared Cohen, Goldman Sachs' President of Global Affairs and former advisor to two different U.S. secretaries of state. He explains how Iran has increasingly tested the Biden administration with their proxy attacks on U.S. forces, Iran's ambitions in the region, and the threat of worsening home-grown terrorism due to radicalization in the Middle East. Later, he gives a preview of his new book about presidential retirement called "Life After Power."
The standoff in Texas continues, as the Lone Star State is refusing to comply with a court order to remove razor wire along the Rio Grande River that prevents migrants from making it onto U.S. soil. 25 Republican governors have banded together to support Texas Governor Gregg Abbott in his fight. Oklahoma's Kevin Stitt is one of them, and he joined the Rundown to discuss why he's standing with Texas and what he thinks the Biden administration needs to do to prevent migrants from entering the United States illegally.
Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of "Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla."

      <title>Evening Edition: Drone Strike In Jordan Kills U.S. Troops  </title>
      <description>A drone strike on a U.S. military base in Jordan has killed three service members and injured over thirty. The 'Islamic Resistance of Iraq', an Iranian-backed terror group, has claimed responsibility for the attack. Also, six Western nations have joined the United States in halting funding to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency after a report issued by Israel alleges a dozen UNRWA employees actively took part in the terror attack of October 7th.
FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Alex Hogan, FOX News foreign correspondent and podcast host now in Tel Aviv, about the drone strike, President Biden vowing to respond to it and the disturbing report on UNRWA.

      <title>Nikki Haley Takes Her Campaign To South Carolina, "Her Name Is On The Line"</title>
      <description>Less than a month remains before South Carolina's winner-take-all primary contest, between former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and former President Trump. The former President has repeatedly called for Haley to drop out of the race, citing polling and lack of party support, but Haley insists the race is not over, until every voter makes their pick for the GOP nominee. Congressman Ralph Norman (R-SC-5) joins the Rundown to discuss why he put his support behind Nikki Haley, why he believes she has what it takes to beat the former President, and addresses GOP leadership urging Haley to drop out of the race before the South Carolina Primary.
 
Despite being on the decline for the last few years, drunk driving fatalities are increasing in the United States. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is working toward requiring new vehicles to include technology to detect when a driver is drunk. However, a future where cars prevent intoxicated persons from getting behind the wheel is still years away. On the Rundown, James C. Fell, a nationally recognized traffic safety researcher and a principal research scientist within NORC at the University of Chicago, explains the technology and what happens when one's blood alcohol level goes beyond the legal limit.
 
Plus, commentary from host of the evening opinion show Tomi Lahren is Fearless on Outkick.com, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Extra: Is America Ready For The Next Major War? Experts Say No.</title>
      <description>American prosperity and military supremacy since the end of World War Two have made the U.S. "the world's policeman," many times being forced to intervene in global conflicts. 
A Heritage Foundation report finds our military strength is not what it used to be, or needs to be, to guarantee American interests are protected.

Earlier this week, Dakota Wood joined host Christ Foster to speak about the report and the growing concerns about our country's ability to deal with multiple armed conflicts ... or even a single conflict.
The interview was informative and alarming as the retired Marine discussed our military recruitment problems and our old, outdated equipment. The two also discussed the American people's concerns about Pentagon waste and whether more funding for the military is the answer.

      <title>From Washington: The Shifting Politics Of Abortion</title>
      <description>While many Americans are opposed to a rematch between the 2020 presidential candidates, the Biden campaign has been focused on making former President Trump the Republican challenger in 2024. Congressman Dean Phillips (D-MN) says it's too soon for President Biden to be in general election mode and explains why he's challenging the incumbent. Later, Democratic Strategist and Former 2020 Biden Campaign Surrogate Kevin Walling discusses Democrats' strategy throughout the rest of the primary season and discusses which issues will be at the center of the Biden campaign's messaging ahead of the general election in November.
For decades abortion has commonly been an election issue for Republicans. That may not be in the case in 2024 as Democrats feel Americans are still angry about the overturning of Roe v. Wade. President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are putting the topic in the forefront as they gear up their campaign to stay in the White House. But how will the issue be on the minds of voters when head to the polls come November? GOP pollster and President of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter joins to discuss how much the abortion issue matters to independent voters, why Republicans must navigate the issue wisely if they want to come out with a win later this year, and what other issues are top of mind for Americans.

      <title>Extra: Why The GOP Is Still Demanding Answers Regarding COVID's Origins.</title>
      <description>Following former President Trump's decisive victory over former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in the New Hampshire Primary, many Republicans called for the party to unite and focus on the general election against President Biden.
One of those Republicans was Kansas Senator Roger Marshall. 
He thinks the GOP needs to stop fighting among itself and work to put an end to what he sees as the Biden Administration's harmful policies on the border and the economy. 
Sen. Marshall joined host Dave Anthony on the Rundown to discuss his support for Trump, the border crisis, and what he hopes a potential bipartisan immigration bill should look like.
The Kansas Senator, who is a physician as well, also weighed in on the ongoing investigation into the origins of COVID and what he thinks the American people will learn as Dr. Anthony Fauci, former Director at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and other health officials from that period continue to get scrutinized by Congress.
 
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Kansas Senator Roger Marshall. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more of his take on the 2024 presidential race, the border crisis, and what he sees as a cover-up surrounding the origins of COVID-19.

      <title>From Washington: Nikki Haley Vows To Fight On, But Does She Have A Path To Victory?</title>
      <description>Although former President Donald Trump's New Hampshire primary victory further strengthened his status as the clear front-runner, his Republican challenger former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has vowed to stay in the GOP presidential race. Professor of Government at the University of Texas-Austin and member of the FOX News National Decision team Daron Shaw shares his takeaways from Tuesday's results in New Hampshire and looks ahead to the next primary contests.

﻿Despite efforts in Washington to achieve a bipartisan Senate deal linking border security funding and Ukraine aid, GOP lawmakers are confronting a difficult obstacle: former President Donald Trump. With one of the most influential leaders of the GOP lobbying against the plan, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell privately acknowledged he faces a steep, uphill battle getting the support to make the deal happen in Washington. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram reports on McConnell's border "quandary."

      <title>Is President Biden Banking On A Single Issue To Win Reelection?</title>
      <description>President Biden continues to make abortion a main focus of his reelection campaign, directly blaming former President Donald Trump for the lack of abortion access in the U.S.. The tactic comes at a time when many voters are unhappy with his handling of the economy and the border. FOX News Sunday Anchor and host of the Living the Bream podcast Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to recap the New Hampshire primary, explain why voters are unhappy with the current state of the economy, and detail how Biden is using abortion to drum up support from Democrats.
 
Chronic absenteeism in school has been a growing problem in the U.S. for years. The COVID-19 pandemic only made it worse. Several cities have even attempted programs that incentivize kids to show up to class. Ohio State Representative Dani Isaacsohn (D-Cincinatti) is co-sponsoring a bill that addresses truancy in his state by paying parents and students for exceptional attendance. He joins the Rundown to explain why he feels that the incentives could solve Ohio's education crisis, and how research from other attendance programs helped them form their proposal.
 
Plus, commentary from host of the Kennedy Saves The World Podcast, Kennedy.

He joins the Rundown to explain why he feels that the incentives could solve Ohio's education crisis, and how research from other attendance programs helped them form their proposal.</p><p> </p><p>Plus, commentary from host of the <em>Kennedy Saves The World </em>Podcast, Kennedy.</p><p><br></p><p>(Image: Adam Bettcher Via AP)</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Evening Edition: UN Says Gaza Medical Facility Sheltering Refugees Was Bombed  </title>
      <description>The United Nations says a facility housing hundreds of Palestinian refugees was struck by Israeli tanks killing a dozen and injuring over seventy. The IDF denies the attack saying Hamas militants are hiding in Khan Younis medical facilities. Washington has denounced the attack and relief agencies are saying the siege in Khan Younis is causing major problems to the distribution of humanitarian aid.

FOX's Alex Hogan speaks with Thomas White, the Gaza director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), who says the IDF has to be more careful, especially with military operations near centers of humanitarian efforts.

      <title>More Republicans Agree, "It's Time To Unite Behind Trump"</title>
      <description>Former President Donald Trump defeated former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley by ten points in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. As the race continues, Trump continues to win support from members of the Republican Party, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Senator Tim Scott, and Vivek Ramaswamy, all of whom have suspended their campaigns. Kansas Senator Roger Marshall endorsed Trump in the 2024 race and says there is "no path to victory" for Haley. He joins the Rundown to discuss the results of the primary, why the country needs to secure the border, and the need for lawmakers to continue investigating the origins of COVID-19.
As conflicts in the Middle East continue to escalate, questions about America's military readiness are being posed by government officials. Iranian proxies have not stopped attacks against U.S. forces in the region, and in the South Pacific, China continues to signal that an invasion of Taiwan could be imminent. Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow and Editor of their annual Index of U.S. Military Strength, Dakota Wood, joins the podcast to discuss the report's findings, how the lack of military readiness impacts our allies across the globe, and the steps that the federal government could take to ensure that U.S. armed forces will be ready for the next global conflict.
Plus, commentary from FOX News contributor Joe Concha.

      <description>After winning both Iowa and New Hampshire, former President Trump gave a speech touting his victories while also disparaging his last GOP opponent, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.

      <title>Former President Trump &amp; President Biden Both Score Wins In New Hampshire As Rematch Looms Large </title>
      <description>Former President Trump has won the New Hampshire primary, beating his last GOP opponent former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley in a closer than expected race. Political pundits and primary polls alike forecast that Trump will handily win the next primary in Haley's home state of South Carolina, which could cement his status as the GOP's nominee for president in 2024. Meantime, President Biden won his primary bid against Minnesota Congressman Dean Phillips, led by a write-in campaign following the DNC's decision to move the first primary of their election calendar to South Carolina. Fox News Radio political analyst Josh Kraushaar and Fox News Audio Political Anchor and Washington Correspondent Jared Halpern join the Rundown to discuss Nikki Haley's decision to speak first following the primary being called for the former President, what the win means for the Trump campaign, and what Haley will do to make up ground going into the South Carolina primary.

More than six million American seniors are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and experts say the number will double in the next 25 years. However, a new study released this week shows there may be hope for early detection. Researchers in Sweden discovered that specific proteins found in blood can accurately detect the disease before symptoms arise. FOX News medical correspondent and Professor of Medicine at NYU Langone, Dr. Marc Siegel, joins the Rundown to discuss how Alzheimer's affects the body, share how the new test works, and explain why younger patients may want to take preventative measures.

      <title>New Hampshire Becomes A Real Two-Person Race</title>
      <description>She was the second candidate to announce her campaign; now, she is one of the last candidates left in the race. Many forecast that the New Hampshire primary could be former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley’s last chance to prove the strength of her candidacy against former President Donald Trump. Haley came in third during the Iowa Caucuses; however, now that Florida Governor DeSantis has suspended his campaign, it gives Haley a shot at running in a two-person race. Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff and FOX News contributor Karl Rove discusses what could make Nikki Haley competitive in these primaries and why Governor DeSantis chose the right time to step down.
Now that just two contenders remain in the Republican primary race, Nikki Haley is hopeful that the state’s open primary will give her momentum by picking up independent voters. Meanwhile, President Biden is mounting a write-in campaign against Minnesota Congressman Dean Phillips in the state after the Democratic National Committee moved the primary schedule, with South Carolina now taking New Hampshire's place as the first primary on their calendar. FOX News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar joins to discuss Nikki Haley’s potential path for success in New Hampshire, why this is a pivotal moment in the 2024 campaign, and how the DNC's decision to remove New Hampshire from this year's primary process could hurt President Biden.
Plus, commentary by the host of “Fox Across America” and “Fox News Saturday Night,” Jimmy Failla.

        <![CDATA[<p>She was the second candidate to announce her campaign; now, she is one of the last candidates left in the race. Many forecast that the New Hampshire primary could be former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley’s last chance to prove the strength of her candidacy against former President Donald Trump. Haley came in third during the Iowa Caucuses; however, now that Florida Governor DeSantis has suspended his campaign, it gives Haley a shot at running in a two-person race. Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff and FOX News contributor Karl Rove discusses what could make Nikki Haley competitive in these primaries and why Governor DeSantis chose the right time to step down.</p><p>Now that just two contenders remain in the Republican primary race, Nikki Haley is hopeful that the state’s open primary will give her momentum by picking up independent voters. Meanwhile, President Biden is mounting a write-in campaign against Minnesota Congressman Dean Phillips in the state after the Democratic National Committee moved the primary schedule, with South Carolina now taking New Hampshire's place as the first primary on their calendar. FOX News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar joins to discuss Nikki Haley’s potential path for success in New Hampshire, why this is a pivotal moment in the 2024 campaign, and how the DNC's decision to remove New Hampshire from this year's primary process could hurt President Biden.</p><p>Plus, commentary by the host of “Fox Across America” and “Fox News Saturday Night,” Jimmy Failla.</p><p><br></p><p>Photo Credits: AP</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Evening Edition: Automakers Pump The Brakes On Electric Vehicles</title>
      <description>Many of America's biggest automakers are pumping the brakes on their manufacturing of electric vehicles, with Ford being one of the latest to slash production of their F-150 electric pickup. American drivers skeptical of full electric cars are now leaning toward hybrids, which saw their sales rise 65% in 2023. EVs are not just struggling to attract buyers because of their prices; recent extreme weather across the country showed electric cars struggling to perform in the cold. Fox Business correspondent Jeff Flock joins the podcast to discuss why car manufacturers are cutting their EV production, the trends of American car ownership, and revelations about the shortcomings of electric cars.

      <title>Extra: Are Democrats And Republicans Conspiring Against Third Parties?</title>
      <description>Less than ten months to Election Day in November, a Trump-Biden rematch is looking more and more likely, even though voters surveyed consistently say that's not what they want. So the bipartisan organization No Labels continues its efforts to offer an alternative, seeking ballot access across the country while considering potential candidates for a possible unity ticket. They've had some legal fights already along with questions raised about who their donors are, something the nonprofit group is not required to disclose. Now, they're facing a different headwind, accusing other, mainly left-wing, groups of illegally trying to block their efforts and subverting voters' rights. A complaint filed with the Justice Department points to activists and party officials. This past week, FOX News Rundown host Lisa Brady spoke to former Republican North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, a National Co-Chair of No Labels about the complaint, their movement and one progressive group's claim that they have a hidden agenda. We made some edits for time and thought you might like to listen to the whole thing. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more from No Labels Co-Chair Pat McCrory and learn more about his group's mission and how they're answering their critics on both sides of the aisle.

      <title>From Washington: The White House Response To Houthi Rebels In The Red Sea</title>
      <description>This week, Houthi rebels in Yemen and the southwest border dominated conversations within the White House. While Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was released from the hospital, the U.S. struck Houthi sites in Yemen as the rebels continued to attack commercial ships in the Red Sea. Texas and the federal government continue to fight over the southern border after a migrant and her two children drowned in the Rio Grande River. The White House alleges Texas refused border patrol agents to access that part of the border, insinuating the incident could have been prevented. FOX Business Network's White House Correspondent Edward Lawrence explains how the White House is responding to these events.
The 2024 Presidential Election kicked off last week in Iowa, and now the top three Republican presidential candidates are headed to New Hampshire to vie for voters' support. Iowans placed the majority of their support behind former President Donald Trump, leaving Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley battling for second -- but will the results be the same in New Hampshire? To give some insight into the energy on the ground, Chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party Chris Ager shares the history behind the New Hampshire Primary, which candidates are resonating with most with voters, and how he believes the results that come out of his state could impact the campaign trail.

      <title>Extra: A Critical Senate Showdown In Michigan</title>
      <description>Earlier this week,  FOX News Rundown host Dave Anthony spoke with former Congressman Mike Rogers.
 
After leaving politics for a few years, Rogers is now running for Senate in Michigan.  
 
But before even having a chance at winning the seat being vacated Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow, he must win a highly competitive Republican primary where his main opponents are former Detroit Police Chief James Craig and former Congressman Peter Meijer.

Rogers discussed his campaign, and the importance of flipping Michigan's seat red if the GOP hopes to win back control of the Senate.
 
The Former Chair of the House Intel Committee also weighed in on the debate over securing the border and the Biden Administration's handling of the conflicts in the Middle East and Europe
 
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with former Congressman and Michigan GOP Senate Candidate Mike Turner. 

On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even from Turner and learn about the Michigan Senate race that will get major attention this election season.

      <title>From Washington: Iowa's Results Are In, Now To New Hampshire</title>
      <description>Former President Donald Trump ran away with a resounding victory in the Iowa Caucuses, winning over 50% of the vote. It was a close race for second place with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis narrowly beating former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Now, the candidates are looking ahead at New Hampshire to see what the primaries will reveal about the state of the Republican Party. FOX News Decision Desk Director Arnon Mishkin provides his takeaways from Iowa and lays out the challenges candidates face in the elections.
Congress passed a short-term spending bill that extended government funding through March, narrowly avoiding a partial government shutdown. House Speaker Mike Johnson is now facing the same pressures and dangers to his speakership experienced by his predecessor, Speaker Kevin McCarthy, as he attempts to unite his divided party. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram provides a recap of the week in Congress and discusses the state of division within the House and Senate.

      <title>Shannon Bream On Trump Courtroom Battles &amp; The Primaries Ahead: “It’s Sink Or Swim”</title>
      <description>Former President Donald Trump aims to replicate his success in Iowa at the New Hampshire primary in a few days. After coming in third in the Hawkeye State, Nikki Haley has been campaigning hard in New Hampshire, looking to assert herself as a strong second to the former President. Despite polling in the single digits, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has decided to skip the state entirely and head to South Carolina to shore up his voter support. FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to preview the upcoming contest and break down the latest from the Supreme Court.
Polling shows the majority of Americans have little enthusiasm for a Biden-Trump rematch in 2024, and the No Labels Party believes this leaves a lane for them to challenge the status quo with a third-party run. As they search for candidates for a “Unity ticket” in 2024, they have faced severe difficulties getting on the ballot. They allege these roadblocks are part of a racketeering conspiracy and have called on the U.S. Justice Department to investigate. Former Governor of North Carolina and now national co-chair of the No Labels Party, Pat McCrory, joins the podcast to discuss their organization's plan to appeal to American moderates who want an alternative, the opposition they’ve faced getting on the ballot, and what kind of candidates they want for their “Unity ticket.”
Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.
Plus, commentary by Fox News Medical Contributor and author of "Panic Attack," Dr. Nicole Saphier.

      <title>Evening Edition: DOJ Calls Uvalde Shooting Response A 'Significant Failure' </title>
      <description>U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland was in Uvalde, Texas today and shared the findings of the Department of Justice's “Critical Incident Review”, their report into the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in the Spring of 2022. Nineteen children and two teachers were killed by an eighteen-year-old shooter before police finally took him out. Local and state law enforcement, both showing up to the scene of the shooting, have faced harsh criticism over their response that many just saw as too slow with no real effort to quickly neutralize the shooter.

FOX's John Saucier speaks with FOX's Casey Stegall, senior correspondent for FOX News, about the findings in the report and the reaction to it.

      <title>Will A Fishermen's Supreme Court Case Reel In Government Overreach?</title>
      <description>This week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce, a case that could overturn a decades-old legal precedent that gave the government broad powers to regulate businesses. Fishermen across the east coast argue that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has gone too far in its supervision of fisheries, forcing some boats to even foot the bill for government workers. Seafreeze Limited's Fisheries Liaison Meghan Lapp and New Civil Liberties Alliance President Mark Chenoweth join to discuss their position as plaintiffs in the case, why they feel the regulatory agency has gone too far, and what the Court can do to fix this issue.

While Republicans have their sights set on the New Hampshire primary next week, they are also keeping a close eye on the balance of power in the next Congress. Michigan Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow is not running for another term, leaving her seat up for grabs. Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin is the frontrunner in the Democratic race, and polls show she is neck-and-neck with any of the three leading Republicans. One of them is former Congressman Mike Rogers. He joined the podcast to discuss what he thinks the major issues plaguing the country are and his plans if elected senator.

Plus, commentary from host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Evening Edition: The U.S. Again Labels 'Houthis' A Terror Group </title>
      <description>In response to attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Boden administration has redesigned the 'Houthis' in Yemen a terrorist organization. The Houthis will now be on a global terror watchlist that will trigger sanctions on the group. The Trump administration designated them a terror group as the administration left office and the current State Department took them off in 2021.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Richard Goldberg, senior advisor at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and former member of the White House National Security Council, about what this means to efforts to stop attacks on shipping.

      <title>Will The Granite State Grant Trump The Nomination?</title>
      <description>With Iowa behind them, candidates are now focused on persuading New Hampshire voters ahead of the primary. The Nikki Haley campaign vowed to be even stronger in this second voting contest for the GOP nomination. Despite coming in third at the Iowa Caucuses, Haley firmly believes that America "deserves better" and that she is the right fit for commander in chief. Former President Donald Trump won Iowa by 30 points and is looking to take home another victory next week. Chris Ryan, host of New Hampshire Today on WGIR AM, joins the Rundown to give his analysis of the state of the New Hampshire primary race and evaluate Haley's campaign strategy leading up to it.

California may soon ban tackle football for children under the age of 12, after growing concerns about the safety of young athletes when it comes to brain injuries. Assembly Bill 734 would phase out tackle football for younger players, but some communities in the Golden State are pushing back. Chairman and President of the California Youth Football Alliance, Ron White, joins the podcast to share his perspective as a coach, administrator, and mentor to the youth football community for over 30 years. White explains why he thinks the bill to ban tackle football is an overreaction, the value of parental choice in sports, revelations about the tie between tackle football injuries and CTE, and what his organization is doing to fight this California legislation.

Plus, commentary from FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce.

Chris Ryan, host of New Hampshire Today on WGIR AM, joins the Rundown to give his analysis of the state of the New Hampshire primary race and evaluate Haley's campaign strategy leading up to it.</p><p><br></p><p>California may soon ban tackle football for children under the age of 12, after growing concerns about the safety of young athletes when it comes to brain injuries. Assembly Bill 734 would phase out tackle football for younger players, but some communities in the Golden State are pushing back. Chairman and President of the California Youth Football Alliance, Ron White, joins the podcast to share his perspective as a coach, administrator, and mentor to the youth football community for over 30 years. White explains why he thinks the bill to ban tackle football is an overreaction, the value of parental choice in sports, revelations about the tie between tackle football injuries and CTE, and what his organization is doing to fight this California legislation.</p><p><br></p><p>Plus, commentary from FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce.</p><p><br></p><p>Photo Credit: (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Iowa Caucuses Show Strong Support For Former President Trump</title>
      <description>The Iowa Caucuses have come to an end with a decisive victory for the frontrunner, former President Trump. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has touted his distant second-place finish ahead of the next contest in New Hampshire, while Former South Carolina Nikki Haley declared the election a "two-person race" heading into the next Primary. Fox News Radio political analyst Josh Kraushaar and Fox News Audio Political Anchor and Washington Correspondent Jared Halpern join the Rundown to discuss former President Trump's dominance in Iowa and forecast likelihoods in the next GOP primaries in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.

Over 100 days have passed since the war in Gaza began, and Israel has faced increased international pressure to scale back fighting in the region. The Israeli government has stated that they plan to respect the rules of war, however, they have also vowed to continue the conflict until they achieve their goal of eliminating Hamas and rescuing the captured hostages in Gaza. FOX News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst joins the Rundown to discuss how Israel is defending itself against genocide accusations and the latest attacks in the Red Sea.

Plus, commentary by former Congressman Jason Chaffetz, host of 'The Jason in the House' podcast.

      <title>From Washington: Iowans Brave The Cold For This Year's Caucuses</title>
      <description>Republicans will gather in 1,600 precincts in Iowa on Monday, and after listening to speeches by each campaign, voters will write down their favorite candidate. The handwritten names are tallied on-site and reported both to the state party through traditional means and entered into an app for viewing. Former Aide to Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, Jimmy Centers previews the Iowa Caucuses, expecting ​this year's assembly to be especially interesting due to an increase of first-time caucus-goers, strong opposition to the incumbent candidate...and below-freezing temperatures. 

The Iowa Caucuses are on Monday, and former President Donald Trump is shaping up to be a shoo-in. However, inclement weather and sub-zero temperatures may make it difficult for people in the Hawkeye State to cast their ballot. Following his departure from the race, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was caught on a hot mic saying fellow candidate Nikki Haley would get "smoked" in the contest. On Wednesday, former President Trump shared at the FOX News Town Hall that he agrees with Christie for once. FOX News Radio's Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar and FOX News Radio's Washington D.C. Correspondent and political anchor Jared Halpern preview the event and discuss the remaining candidates' strategy to take home a win.

      <title>Extra: Jimmy Failla Talks Comedy, Cancel Culture, And His Alleged Mob Ties</title>
      <description>Jimmy Failla's got another gig.
He's already a stand-up comedian, a weekday radio show, "FOX Across America", and a new book coming out.
But if he wasn't busy already, he now has his own TV show debuting this weekend, "FOX News Saturday Night with Jimmy Failla."
Earlier this week, Failla join host Chris Foster on the FOX News Rundown to talk about all of those jobs and answer some serious - and not so serious - questions about his career.
Jimmy talks for a living so this was a great time and the conversation went on too long to fit into the regular weekday podcast and radio show.
On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear the whole interview and learn so much more about Jimmy Failla including what he considered his favorite comedy album, how he manages to eat between jobs, and if he's actually in fact related to an infamous mobster.

      <title>From Washington: Defense Secretary's Health Raises Questions Amid Middle East Conflict</title>
      <description>This week, the U.S. and U.K. launched significant airstrikes against Houthi military targets in Yemen. The airstrikes were carried out by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin while hospitalized at Walter Reed Military Medical Center. The Defense Secretary is under scrutiny due to the lack of transparency about his health concerns, prompting many to question the country's military readiness. FOX News White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich discusses Secretary Austin's future and provides updates amid the escalating conflict in the Middle East.

On Wednesday, Hunter Biden shocked Representatives when he appeared at a House Oversight Committee hearing, defying a subpoena for a closed-door testimony. Meanwhile, the House Homeland Security Committee held an impeachment hearing for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in which they criticized his performance in handling the crisis at the U.S. Southern border. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram shares a firsthand look at the drama that unfolded at the Capitol this week.

      <title>Shannon Bream On Iowa, Christie Fallout, &amp; Defense Secretary Scandal</title>
      <description>Republican candidates are making their final preparations for the Iowa Caucuses. Former President Trump still holds a commanding lead in the polls over his challengers, but Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is hoping his door-to-door campaign tactics will deliver his campaign a win. Anchor of FOX News Sunday Shannon Bream joins to discuss how Governor Christie dropping out of the race impacts candidates like former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, the scandal caused by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's unannounced hospital stay, and how the border crisis will play into the 2024 election.

“FOX Across America” radio show host Jimmy Failia was a New York City cab driver before becoming a popular stand-up comedian. Now, in addition to his show and new comedy special, Failia has another job to add to his resume: the host of "FOX News Saturday Night with Jimmy Failia." He joins the Rundown to discuss his new gig, preview his book, "Cancel Culture Dictionary: An A to Z Guide to Winning the War on Fun," and share how he got his start at FOX.

Plus, commentary from co-host of Fox &amp; Friends Weekends and host of ‘The Will Cain Podcast’ Will Cain.

      <title>Hunter Biden Crashes Capitol Hill Hearing</title>
      <description>Hunter Biden made a surprise appearance on Capitol Hill this week, as he crashed a hearing that was held to determine whether or not he would be held in contempt for defying a House subpoena. House Republicans have been investigating Biden's overseas business dealings, and his father, the President's potential involvement. FOX News Legal Editor Kerri Kupec Urbahn joins to discuss the legal ramifications Hunter Biden faces for defying the House subpoena, why she believes Hunter made the appearance before Congress, and how his gun charges in California impact the federal investigation into his business dealings.

Congress is yet again working down to the minute to avoid a possible government shutdown. The first funding deadline is next week, but a larger shutdown is on the horizon if Congress fails to reach a deal by February 2nd. Over the weekend, Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) worked out a continuing resolution to fund the government until then. However, many Republicans in the House are against it. Congressman Matt Rosendale (R-MT) is one of them and joins the Rundown to discuss his opposition to the CR and why he thinks the House should impeach the Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.

Plus, commentary by National Security Expert, Dr. Rebecca Grant.

      <title>Evening Edition: Navigating The Media Coverage Of Gaza Conflict </title>
      <description>The Israel-Hamas conflict has entered its third month and the 'fog of war' continues to effect the media coverage of it.

Now, a new watchdog group has been assembled to monitor the reporting coming from the war.      

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Brad Todd, lead advisor for the '10/7 Project', about the group and how they are fighting against disinformation.

      <title>How Unstoppable Is A Trump GOP Nomination?</title>
      <description>With the Iowa caucuses less than a week away,
all the polls are showing one clear message: former President Donald Trump
remains the Republican frontrunner. In the face of unprecedented legal troubles
and mounting lawsuits, the former president’s campaign has thrived as he speaks
out against these cases, which he calls election interference. Trump will join
Martha MacCallum, anchor and executive editor of The Story, and Bret Baier, FOX's
chief political anchor, on Wednesday for a town hall to discuss his
presidential campaign. Martha MacCallum joined the Rundown from Iowa to preview
the event and discuss where the candidates stand ahead of the first contest.

An Alaska Airlines flight made an emergency
landing as an equipment malfunction caused an emergency exit door to fly off of
the plane at 16,000 feet. The incident has called into question the safety of
the Boeing 737 Max 9, as Alaska Airlines has discovered more loose hardware on
other planes in their fleet. The National Transportation Safety Board has
launched an investigation into the cause of the door plug failure. Former NTSB
Accident Investigator and senior aerospace engineer and President of
Transportation Safety and Security Consulting, Charley Pereira, joins to
discuss the potential causes of the emergency, the potential consequences of
this failure, and what the FAA must do to ensure passenger safety.

Plus, commentary by columnist David Marcus.

      <title>Biden Reelection Campaign Hits The Road, Facing Uphill Battle</title>
      <description>On Monday, President Biden delivered remarks in Charleston at the Mother Emanuel AME Church on Monday, recalling the deadly shooting that took place there in 2015 and denouncing white supremacy. This is part of his revamped reelection campaign, making key stops in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, discussing the goals of the administration should they win a second term and attacking former President Trump for his "MAGA" agenda. Still, the President is facing poor polling among minority voters, a key group in his base. Democratic Strategist and former Communication Director for Senator Klobuchar, Tim Hogan, joins to discuss President Biden's reelection campaign, the troubles he is facing from his voter base, and the necessary strategy for Team Biden heading into the general election.

January has Americans turning to New Year's resolutions involving their health: eating well, exercising, and even drinking less. However, a recent survey showed 44 percent of young adults planned a resolution related to their own mental health. Improving your well-being can involve so much more than just sticking to your diet goals; it's finding the calm in everyday life. Ross Rayburn, Peloton’s lead instructor of yoga and meditation, joins the podcast to discuss his new book, "Turning Inward: The Practice of Introversion for a Calm, Joyful, Authentic Life," how he approaches teaching meditation to skeptics, and advice for staying calm during an election year.

Plus, commentary from host of the “Kennedy Saves The World” podcast, Kennedy.

      <title>Evening Edition: Boeing 737 MAX Planes Grounded After Door Flies Off  </title>
      <description>The Federal Aviation Administration Friday ordered the grounding of nearly two hundred of Boeing's 737 MAX planes worldwide after the door plug of an Alaska Airlines plane blew off mid-flight. Alaska and United Airlines both made the decision to ground all of their 737 MAX fleet as they waited instructions on inspections of the planes. There were no fatalities in the Alaska Airlines incident but it is the latest problem with a plane that was grounded worldwide after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed nearly three hundred and fifty people.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Mike Boyd, President of the Boyd Group International, focusing on aviation  forecasting and consulting, and pilot, about the Alaska Airlines incident and how this grounding could impact air travel in the immediate future.

      <title>Rep. Mike Turner On Securing the Border, Funding Negotiations &amp; 2024 GOP Agenda</title>
      <description>As Congress returns from the holiday break, members come face-to-face with looming deadlines for funding decisions. With mounting pressure to continue aiding allies in Israel, Ukraine, and the Indo-Pacific while also prioritizing funding to secure our Southern border, House Republicans, Senate Democrats, and a Democratic White House must come together to reach an agreement — but will they be able to in time? On the Rundown, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner (R-OH) explains why securing the border should be a priority over funding allies overseas. He also discusses Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin being hospitalized in intensive care for five days without notifying the public, the potential of the Israel-Hamas war expanding in the Middle East region, and why the U.S. must keep an eye on adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea to ensure they don’t strengthen relations.

216,000 jobs were created in December, showing that the American labor market remains strong even as high interest rates persist. The latest data highlights that inflation and job growth are easing back toward pre-pandemic norms. Despite the good news, recent polls show that Americans continue to be dissatisfied with the state of the U.S. economy. Co-anchor of the Big Money Show on FOX Business, Brian Brenberg, joins the Rundown to break down the latest jobs report and why the President’s “Bidenomics” message isn’t resonating with Americans.

Plus, commentary by Jason Rantz, Host of the Jason Rantz Show and author of “What’s Killing America.”

      <title>Extra: Is It Time For The U.S. To Stop Sending Military Aid To Ukraine?</title>
      <description>When Congress returns this week, they face a long to-do list that includes the debate over approving more additional military aid for Ukraine
The American people's support for funding Ukraine's efforts against Russia has waned significantly since the war began nearly three years ago. Further complicating things, many Republicans say they will not vote for any additional foreign aid until the U.S.'s southern border is addressed.
Earlier this week, Congressman Michael Waltz (R-FL) joined host Dave Anthony to discuss why he thought backing Ukraine remains in America's interest, but also laid out why the war-torn country cannot simply receive a blank check.

      <itunes:summary>When Congress returns this week, they face a long to-do list that includes the debate over approving more additional military aid for Ukraine
The American people's support for funding Ukraine's efforts against Russia has waned significantly since the war began nearly three years ago. Further complicating things, many Republicans say they will not vote for any additional foreign aid until the U.S.'s southern border is addressed.
Earlier this week, Congressman Michael Waltz (R-FL) joined host Dave Anthony to discuss why he thought backing Ukraine remains in America's interest, but also laid out why the war-torn country cannot simply receive a blank check.
Rep. Waltz also discussed the ongoing crisis in the Red Sea and how the Houthi rebels continue to attack ships and disrupt global trade.

      <title>From Washington: Inside Iowa's Caucus</title>
      <description>Delegates from the Hawkeye State will gather in just one week to kick off the 2024 Presidential Primary season, casting their ballot for who they want to represent their respective parties come November. Chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa Jeff Kaufmann explains how the caucus procedure will play out, determines whether the Iowa caucuses are a strong indicator of how a presidential candidate will do later in the election cycle, and predicts a higher turnout for this year's GOP, driven possibly by new fears amongst Americans.

Although the Biden Administration has touted its investments in green energy, it hasn't abandoned fossil fuels. Despite many policy efforts, oil production in the United States reached record numbers last year. Senior Vice President of Policy, Economics, and Regulatory Affairs at the American Petroleum Institute Dustin Meyer discusses the reasons for this increase and what it means for gas prices and energy policy in the new year.

      <title>Extra: How A Retired Baseball Star Could Be The Key To A GOP-Led Senate</title>
      <description>It's not just the White House up for grabs in 2024. There are also races key to who controls Congress. One contest getting national attention is the race in California to fill the Senate seat left up for grabs following the passing of Dianne Feinstein this past September.
A few prominent Golden State Democrats, like Congressman Adam Schiff and Congresswoman Katie Porter, are vying for the spot.
However, former Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres star Steve Garvey has decided to step up to the plate and challenge the career politicians.
Earlier this week, Garvey joined host Dave Anthony to discuss what drove him to launch his Senate campaign and how he'd address the issues he feels are deeply impacting Californians.
Garvey, who is running as a Republican, also explained how his message and 'moderate' views could help him score a big upset in the deep blue state.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with former Major League Baseball star and current Senate Candidate Steve Garvey. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even from Garvey about his campaign and the baseball talk that didn't make our original segment.

      <title>From Washington: Biden 2024 Campaign Kick-Off</title>
      <description>President Joe Biden officially began 2024 with a campaign speech on Friday, laying out what's at stake for the upcoming election and defining it as a fight for democracy ahead of the third anniversary of the Capitol riot. It was the president's first campaign event of the year, and the Biden camp jumped on the fact that many Americans remain shaken by former President Trump's alleged involvement in the events on January 6th. Fox News Radio's Political Anchor and Washington Correspondent, Jared Halpern, explains President Biden's anti-MAGA campaign strategy and why he continues to tout his economic success despite an unfavorable response from Americans.
2024 is an election year, and while many are looking ahead to November's general election, special elections in the coming months will also have big implications for the Congressional balance of power. With vacancies in many high-profile seats, the earlier contests could mean House Republicans lose their majority control. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram explains what makes special elections so interesting and discusses the pressure placed on Speaker Johnson as he navigates his party's slim majority.

      <title>Evening Edition: ISIS Conducts Terror Attack On Iran, Why?  </title>
      <description>The Sunni terrorist group ISIS has claimed responsibility for Wednesday's bombing in Iran that killed more than eighty people during a anniversary ceremony honoring General Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2019. It was the deadliest attack on Iranian soil since their 1979 revolution. This happening during a time in which Iran's proxy groups are actively involved in conflict with Israel.   

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Behnam Ben Taleblu, Senior Fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies focusing on Iranian politics and security issues, who breaks down the differences in loyalty between Iran, their proxy groups and the Afghan branch of the Islamic State.

      <title>Governor DeSantis Makes His Case To Iowa</title>
      <description>Republican candidates are gearing up for the first primary contest of the 2024 presidential election, with the Iowa GOP caucus just 10 days away. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has campaigned heavily in the state, hoping to upset former President and current front-runner Donald Trump. Still, the Governor faces poor polling in primary states, along with a late surge from the former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley. 2024 GOP candidate, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, joins the Rundown as he shares his strategy for winning Iowa, criticizes Nikki Haley for saying that New Hampshire voters will correct the vote out of Iowa, and describes what success for his campaign looks like in Iowa.

Candidates are continuing to prepare for the 2024 election cycle, with President Biden preparing to give multiple campaign speeches, while former President Trump and the rest of the GOP primary candidates make their last campaign pushes before Iowa. Fox News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream joins to talk about DeSantis and Haley's campaign leading up to the Iowa caucus, President Biden's campaign strategy, and the first set of released documents from the Jeffery Epstein case.

      <title>Will Claudine Gay's Resignation Spark A Course Correction For Higher Ed?</title>
      <description>On Tuesday, Harvard President Claudine Gay resigned from her post after weeks of controversy following her “failure to properly condemn” antisemitism on Harvard’s campus and multiple allegations of plagiarism in her scholarly work. The reaction to her resignation largely fell upon partisan lines, with conservatives praising the result as fair and necessary, while many on the left called her resignation the consequence of racism and personal attacks. Former Governor of Indiana and previous president of Purdue University, Mitch Daniels, joins the Rundown to give his insight on the cultural conversation following this resignation, the allegations of Gay’s plagiarism, and the impact this may have on the future of higher education.

Although most of the attention has been on the presidential race, Democrats and Republicans will be battling this upcoming fall for control of both chambers of Congress. One crucial contest that could help sway the balance of power in the Senate is the race to succeed the late Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). A few prominent Golden State Democrats, like Congressman Adam Schiff and Congresswoman Katie Porter, are vying for the spot. However, former Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres player Steve Garvey has decided to step up to the plate and challenge the career politicians. Garvey joins the podcast to discuss what drove him to launch his campaign for the Senate and his take on several issues he feels are deeply impacting Californians.

Plus, commentary from FOX News contributor Joe Concha.

      <title>Should America Keep Funding Multiple Foreign Wars?</title>
      <description>The war in Ukraine has entered its third calendar year, and Russia continues to intensify its attacks. Last week, the largest aerial assault since the invasion began resulted in dozens of Ukrainian civilians' deaths. President Biden is urging Congress to pass a $110 billion aid package that includes funding for Ukraine, Israel, and border security. However, the bill is currently stalled on Capitol Hill. Congressman Michael Waltz (R-FL) joins the Rundown to discuss why he believes aid responsibilities should not only fall to the United States and why the White House needs to change its policies regarding the Houthis attacks in the Red Sea.

The new year begins with yet another record being broken at the border, as more people come from around the world while Customs and Border Protection says we have little idea who most of these people are. After December saw a record number of border apprehensions in a single month, many lawmakers are pushing even harder for funding that would increase border security and attempt to drive down the number of illegal crossings. National Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council, Jon Anfinsen joins the podcast to explain the main issues and how the Biden administration is addressing them.

Plus, commentary from FOX News Medical Contributor and Professor at New York University Langone Health, Dr. Marc Siegel.

      <title>2024 Race Teases A Potential Presidential Referendum </title>
      <description>Former President Donald Trump continues to dominate the polls into the new year. The Iowa caucus is just weeks away, with Trump poised to win the first Republican contest of the election cycle. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley are vying for second place as their polling numbers continue to narrow. On the Rundown, Daron Shaw, professor of government at the University of Texas-Austin, member of the FOX News National Decision team, and the bipartisan FOX News polling group discusses what's in store for the GOP candidates heading into the election year. 

The past year presented Americans with a housing market at a standstill, with a lagging economy and the Fed’s rising interest rates hurting the real estate sector severely. Yet, good news may be on the horizon. The Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, suggested that with inflation falling faster than anticipated, the Fed’s rate hikes are likely over. Chief Economist at the National Association of Home Builders, Robert Dietz, joins the podcast to break down this good news, why so many expect the housing market to bounce back in 2024, and how the real estate and home building industry is preparing.

      <title>As Homeless Crisis Worsens, Some Cities Are Stepping Up With Solutions</title>
      <description>Homelessness in the United States is up 12 percent, to more than 650,000 people which is the highest level ever reported by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Across the country, states are encountering the same problems like soaring rents, declining pandemic assistance, and a lack of affordable housing. Yet, in the city of Reno, Nevada, government services are bringing their homeless numbers down. Division Director of the Washoe County Housing and Homeless Services in Nevada, Dana Searcy explains exactly how the construction of Nevada Cares Campus, a large tent facility for the housing of the homeless, became a huge success that is getting folks off the street and into permanent housing.
On October 7th, Hamas terrorists launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing over one thousand Israeli men, women, and children. Now, the Israel Defense Force is locked in a campaign in Gaza to eradicate the terror group that killed and captured so many of their people. Today, we revisit Dana Perino's interview with former foreign policy advisor to President Bush, Dan Senor, about his new book "The Genius of Israel." Dan discusses where he was when he learned of the October 7th Hamas terror attacks, the rampant antisemitism in America brought to light by the war in the Middle East, and how his book unpacks how Israeli citizens unite and project resilience in the face of great adversity.
Plus, commentary by Jason Rantz, Host of the Jason Rantz Show and author of "What's Killing America."

      <title>Extra: Biden's Border Crisis Faces Down Largest Migrant Caravan Of 2023</title>
      <description>A nearly 8,000-strong migrant caravan is heading toward the U.S. border.
The group continued their multi-day march through Mexico as Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico City to discuss solutions to the ongoing surge in illegal border crossings.
In 2023, lawmakers and border communities alike routinely criticized the Biden administration for its struggle to properly maintain and secure the U.S. southern border.
FOX News Senior National Correspondent William La Jeunesse has visited the border many times this year and joined the Rundown to break down these migrant talks in Mexico City and the massive migrant caravan advancing towards the United States.
Due to time limitations, we could not include all of the interview in our original segment. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear our entire interview with William La Jeunesse about the chaotic state of the country's border.

      <title>From Washington: The Evolving Landscape of the 2024 Presidential Race</title>
      <description>Republican presidential hopefuls spent most of 2023 campaigning across the United States. However, as many threw in the towel and withdrew by the end of the year, one thing stayed consistent: former President Donald Trump remains the GOP frontrunner. He heads into 2024 with 91 felony counts against him, legal woes that have yet to impact his broad voter support. Director of the FOX News Decision Desk, Arnon Mishkin, shares the most notable moments from the race so far and discusses the impact of Democrats’ decision to change their primary calendar. 

Despite President Biden touting his Bidenomics agenda throughout the year, poll numbers have consistently shown that the average American believes the economy is not doing well. High cost of living remains a heavy burden for many families, and the White House hoped that their push for a student loan forgiveness plan would soften the blow. Jared Bernstein, the chair of the Biden administration's Council of Economic Advisers, joined in January to discuss the high cost of higher education and the tools Congress has available to combat the price.

      <title>Extra: Tis' The Season...To Be Swatted?</title>
      <description>On Christmas Day, two GOP lawmakers were targeted by prank callers who called in fake emergencies to their homes. These perpetrators "swatted" these representatives, aiming to trick law enforcement into sending heavily armed SWAT units to cause fear and panic at the lawmakers' homes.
Both Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and Congressman Brandon Williams were unharmed, but as a result, law enforcement stressed again that swatting is a dangerous crime that could lead to the deaths of innocent civilians.
Retired FBI special agent John Iannarelli agreed this crime can easily become a lethal one. He joined the FOX News Rundown to explain the concerning trend and why it's life-threatening for law enforcement and civilians alike.
Due to time limitations, we could not include the full interview in our original segment. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear our entire interview with John Iannarelli.

      <description>A historic year for Congress comes to a close. For the first time in history, the Speaker of the House was voted out, and former Congressman George Santos was expelled for numerous ethics violations. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram joins to discuss former Speaker McCarthy’s ousting, the expulsion vote of former Congressman Santos, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ rise to power, and electing a new Speaker.
 
Also this year, the Supreme Court delivered final decisions on various high-profile cases, many of which were used as political tools to ignite voters. In July, the high court struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions, as well as President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan, leading Democrats to take aim at the institution's legitimacy to fire up their base. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram joined co-director of the Fox News Poll and professor at the University of Texas at Austin Daron Shaw after the court reached its decision to discuss how Democrats' strategy ahead of the upcoming election year.

      <title>"A Very Dangerous Theory": State Courts Weigh Disqualifying Trump From 2024 Ballot</title>
      <description>Last week, Colorado's Supreme Court ruled that former President Donald Trump will be disqualified from the 2024 primary ballot, arguing that his involvement on January 6th conflicted with the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban.” Michigan’s Supreme Court heard a similar case and ruled that Trump would remain on the ballot. Colorado's Secretary of State, Jena Griswold, says that the former president’s name will appear on the ballot unless a move by the U.S. Supreme Court gives the state of Colorado the authority. Professor of Law at George Washington University, Jonathan Turley, joins to break down what the decision in Colorado means for the election and whether or not the states have the legal right to decide who will appear on the ballot.

Alice Marie Johnson spent 21 years in prison after she was sentenced to life without parole in 1997 for cocaine trafficking in Memphis, Tennessee. In 2018, after some public advocacy on her behalf from celebrity Kim Kardashian, President Trump granted Alice clemency and had her released. Today we revisit our interview with Alice Marie Johnson, where she discussed her past, her time in prison, and how she is using her freedom to help advocate for criminal justice reform to aid other folks just like her. She discussed what she believes is the right path toward reform and how she’s giving back after "getting a second chance at life."

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

      <title>Evening Edition: Painful Uncertainty For Families Of Israeli Hostages   </title>
      <description>Hamas has rejected the latest offer from Israel for a week long ceasefire in exchange for dozens of hostages still being held by the terror group. Daniel Perez, twenty two, maybe one of those hostages, an IDF officer and the son of a prominent Rabbi. Daniel's family have not been in contact with him since the terror attack of October 7th when he and his brother fought off Hamas.    

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Rabbi Doron Perez, the Executive Director of 'World Mizrachi', about his missing son and the challenge of keeping it together during a time of painful uncertainty.

      <title>Migrant Caravan Marches Towards An Overwhelmed US Border</title>
      <description>As a caravan of thousands of migrants advances towards the southern border, US lawmakers are pleading for more security in anticipation of a surge in illegal crossings. Over the weekend, more than 35,000 migrants were stopped by Customs and Border Protection. This chaos overlaps with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas' trip to Mexico on Wednesday to meet with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. FOX News Senior National Correspondent William La Jeunesse joins the Rundown to discuss the purpose of the talks and the conditions the migrants face at the border.

Of all the news of technological innovation and progress in 2023, no technology was more widely discussed than artificial intelligence. This technology has been controversial, with some proponents advocating that AI is the tool of the future while others warn of the potentially dangerous implications AI could have for humanity. In fact, many tech CEOs and AI researchers released an open letter warning about the pace of AI development. On the FOX News Rundown, we revisit our interview with famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson about the rise of AI and how it will serve society in the future.

Plus, commentary from FOX News Contributor Tammy Bruce.

      <title>Evening Edition: Biden Administration Under Pressure Over Red Sea Attacks </title>
      <description>The United States is facing increasing pressure to find a solution to the deteriorating safety of commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The Iran-backed Houthi militant group has claimed responsibility for yet another missile attack, this time on a MSC Mediterranean Shipping boat, which brings the total number of attacks to over twenty one. While U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a formation of a multinational coalition to secure the waterway, attacks seem to be escalating as shipping companies predict more interruptions in operations.        

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Victoria Coates, Vice President of the Heritage Foundation's Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, and was the former Deputy National Security Advisor during the Trump Administration, who says it is a very troubling situation that needs to be addressed in a way that gives Iran a clear message.

      <title>Swatting, The Next Generation Of Cybercrime?</title>
      <description>On Christmas day, two different Republican lawmakers were victims of an increasingly popular crime called swatting. These prank calls to police aim to send SWAT units to the victim’s home. Both Congressman Brandon Williams (R-NY) and Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) were targeted on Monday but it's not just politicians on the receiving end; everyday Americans have been swatted as well. Retired FBI special agent John Iannarelli joins the Rundown to discuss why it is often hard to track down criminals involved in swatting and how law enforcement trains to respond in those situations.

These past few years in Washington have seen countless political newcomers and outsiders enter the scene and have big impacts on Capitol Hill. In a 2022 Alabama special election, Katie Britt won a decisive victory, becoming the youngest Republican woman elected to the Senate. Since then, she has been widely considered a rising star within Congress. On the FOX News Rundown, we revisit Mike Emanuel’s interview with Senator Katie Britt (R-AL) about her opposition to a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, her belief that the Biden administration has failed to recognize the ongoing border crisis, and the importance of inspiring the next generation.

Plus, commentary by FOX News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett.

      <title>Evening Edition: Jewish Seminary Students Return To Studies    </title>
      <description>The majority of residents in the town of Sderot, Israel, left their homes after the October 7th terrorist attack due to the proximity to Gaza and the ongoing violence. Located in Sderot is the 'Max and Ruth Schwartz Hesder Yeshiva', Israel's largest Hesder Yeshiva seminary school, which immediately closed its doors after the terror attack. Now, students are returning to the school with hopes of inspiring others to come back to the town and regain some normalcy.
FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Rabbi Ari Katz, public relations director of the 'Max and Ruth Schwartz Hesder Yeshiva' in Sderot, Israel, who praises his students for their bravery and hopes it will help the community to heal.

      <title>Seeking Solutions To America's Consumer Debt Crisis</title>
      <description>Americans’ New Year’s resolutions list, but many aren’t confident they can turn their money situation around. Especially as credit card interest rates soar past twenty percent and Americans across the country rake up historically high amounts of debt, many aren’t sure where to begin. On The Rundown, personal finance expert George Kamel breaks down why so many Americans are facing extreme amounts of debt and what steps they should take to regain control of their finances.

2023 had some dismal moments. Every year does. But on the FOX News Rundown, we’re always looking for some positive stories to tell, and today, we revisit our interview with the President of the Mississippi Association of Educators, Erica Jones.

      <title>Hope In The Battle Against Childhood Cancer</title>
      <description>A 2020 nonprofit source cited that 30% of all charitable donations happen in December when people feel more inclined to help the less fortunate, with 10% happening in the month's final three days. Down years are rare, with 2009 being the most recent before 2022, according to Giving USA. One charity hoping that you keep them in mind this year is Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Rick Shadyac, President and CEO of ALSAC, the fundraising organization for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, joins the Rundown to discuss the state of pediatric cancer research and future plans for the hospital. 

It was a bad year for Bud Light. The beer company’s brand took a major hit after it put transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in an online ad. The backlash led to a boycott and a massive slump in sales. On the FOX News Rundown, we revisit host Dave Anthony’s interview with “Shark Tank” star Kevin O'Leary and their discussion about the Bud Light saga, and whether it's ever smart for companies to ever ‘get political’.
 
Plus, commentary from Pastor Robert Jeffress of the Dallas First Baptist Church.

      <title>Extra: Why So Many Americans Go To Bed Hungry ... And What You Can Do To Help.</title>
      <description>Imagine not knowing where your next meal is coming from. Unfortunately, that's the reality for millions of Americans.

Nationwide, the USDA reported nearly 13% of U.S. households faced food insecurity in 2022. The worst numbers in nearly a decade.  

And while this time of year we are more likely to think of those less fortunate, the need in this country is year-round.

FOX News Rundown host Lisa Brady recently spoke with Feeding America CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot.

Babineaux-Fontenot told us why food insecurity is on the rise and how their network of food pantries is trying to help. She also discussed how both individuals and the government can better help families struggling to eat or get proper nutrition.

We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Feeding America CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more about America's food crisis and what you can do to help.

      <title>From Washington: The History Of American Whiskey </title>
      <description>For as long as the United States has existed, there has been a history of Americans enjoying the consumption of alcohol. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent and whiskey sommelier Chad Pergram taps into the history of whiskey in America, runs down the list of his favorite distillers, and explains the complex relationship between lawmakers and enjoying a fine glass of something stiff. 
 
Iowa was a hot political battleground this year as presidential candidates trekked across the state to drum up support ahead of the caucuses next month. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R-FL) has visited all ninety-nine counties, making the state a priority from the get-go, and remains in second place behind former President Donald Trump. However, just a few months ago, the focus on the Hawkeye state was much broader, with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum (R-ND) still vying for the nomination. Iowa Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined back in August to discuss the state of the race early on.

      <title>From Washington: Who Leads Gaza In A Post-Hamas World?</title>
      <description>Israeli forces have now entered Gaza City to target Hamas terrorists as the Israel-Hamas war continues into its second month of combat. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated that an Israeli security presence may be needed in Gaza indefinitely, however, the Biden Administration advises against that but agrees a new dynamic between the territories must exist. But what does the future of Gaza look like? International Policy Expert and former State Department Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations Frank Lowenstein provides his take on how the United States should move forward with this conflict.
Social Security and a critical part of Medicare are projected to become insolvent within the next decade, and 2024 presidential candidates are highlighting the issue on the campaign trail. Senior Vice President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget Marc Goldwein breaks down how benefits will be cut in the next ten years, explains why the issue cannot be solved with tax increases alone, and considers solutions proposed by both Democrats and Republicans alike.

      <title>A US Navy Officer Is Out Of A Japan Jail, But He's Still Not Free</title>
      <description>He's no longer in prison in Japan, but Navy Lieutenant Ridge Alkonis is still not free. Now Ridge Alkonis is behind bars in Los Angeles, serving time for a 2021 crash that left two Japanese citizens dead. Alkonis, who was stationed in Japan, says he suffered from acute altitude sickness causing him to lose control of his car before the deadly crash. Now transferred back to America, his frustrated family is asking the Biden administration to commute his sentence and let him return home. Brittany Alkonis, Ridge's wife, joins The Rundown to share their family's story and why she believes her husband should never have been convicted of a crime. She also discusses her efforts to free Ridge and let their children live with their father once again.
 
Colorado's Supreme Court has ruled that former President Donald Trump will not be featured on their state's primary ballot, citing section three of the constitution's fourteenth amendment and the district court's ruling that the former president had engaged in insurrection on January 6th. Trump's team has said they "imminently" plan to challenge this decision by taking it to the Supreme Court, where they must decide if Colorado's ruling is just. On the Rundown, FOX News Sunday Host Shannon Bream explains why she believes the Supreme Court will likely refuse to pass Colorado's ruling and shares her thoughts on other states planning to do the same thing. She also discusses over 12,000 migrants crossing the southern border in a single day last week and whether she believes President Biden will take serious action to address the Border crisis.
 
Plus, commentary by author and Vice President of Communications for Focus on The Family, Paul Batura.

The report also names China, Russia and Iran as others who tried meddling in 2022 congressional elections.   

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Dr. Emanuele Ottolenghi, senior fellow at Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and expert on Iranian influence in Latin America, who says our enemies align themselves with each other to sow chaos during elections.

      <title>“It Has To Be Now.“ An American Family’s Plea For Hamas To Free Their Son</title>
      <description>It's been over 75 days since Hamas' heinous attack on
Israel, where they kidnapped hundreds of innocent civilians, including a small
group of Americans, from their homes and loved ones. Fast forward to now, many
families are still awaiting the return of their children, siblings, parents,
and significant others. As the Biden Administration and government officials
repeatedly promise that rescuing American hostages and freeing all innocent
civilians is their priority, what will it take for Hamas to release those
they've abducted before more lives are lost? On the Rundown, Jonathan
Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was abducted and remains held hostage by Hamas, and
his wife Gillian Kaye recount the traumatic days following the news of Sagui's
kidnapping. They also share what it's been like working closely with the Biden
Administration to get Sagui back and how they hold on to hope, even on the
darkest days.

With grocery prices rising, many families are struggling to
make ends meet. According to Feeding America, one in five children in the U.S.
doesn't have enough to eat, but oftentimes food insecurity is overlooked for
other needs. During the holidays, food banks receive a plethora of donations.
However, the need is year-round. CEO of Feeding America Claire Babineaux-Fontenot
joins the Rundown to discuss why food banks are struggling to receive donations
and how people can help.

      <title>Evening Edition: Colorado Disqualifies Trump From State Ballot </title>
      <description>The Colorado Supreme Court has disqualified Donald Trump from the state's 2024 Election ballot saying he violated the 14th Amendment with his role in the January 6th Capitol insurrection. Colorado had been trying to do this for months and over a dozen other states currently have open legal challenges to Trump's eligibility. The United States Supreme Court is expected to review the decision within weeks.
FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Mark Meredith, FOX News Washington-based correspondent in Des Moines, IA, about the decision by Colorado, reaction from the GOP candidates and where it may go from here.

      <title>Red Sea Chaos Causing Real Problems for the U.S.</title>
      <description>The U.S. is leading a new international task force in the Middle
East to confront threats to commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Nearly every
day since the start of the Israel-Gaza War, oil tankers and cargo ships have
been fired at by the Houthi rebels, an extremist group backed by Iran. Retired
Navy Commander Kirk Lippold joins the Rundown to discuss the supply chain
disruptions caused by the terror attacks and how the U.S. task force is working
to ensure maritime safety. The former USS Cole commander also looks back at the
2000 bombing that killed 17 U.S. Navy sailors.

What does privacy in the age of the internet look like? A few
teachers in the United States are grappling with this question after being
suspended or fired for posting private adult content on the website 'OnlyFans,'
where users paid them to access their pictures or videos. However, there are
many questions surrounding situations like these -- where employees, in this
case teachers, are being punished for things done in their personal lives that
aren't considered illegal, but could be disapproved of. On the Rundown,
Employment Law Attorney Derek J. Demeri explains how much say an employer has
when it comes to what an employee does in their free time and how it may impact
their profession. He also discusses how often people turn to making adult
content to produce a second income and the role that privacy law precedence
plays in cases like these.

Plus, commentary from comedian and FOX News contributor Tom
Shillue.

      <itunes:summary>The U.S. is leading a new international task force in the Middle
East to confront threats to commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Nearly every
day since the start of the Israel-Gaza War, oil tankers and cargo ships have
been fired at by the Houthi rebels, an extremist group backed by Iran. Retired
Navy Commander Kirk Lippold joins the Rundown to discuss the supply chain
disruptions caused by the terror attacks and how the U.S. task force is working
to ensure maritime safety. The former USS Cole commander also looks back at the
2000 bombing that killed 17 U.S. Navy sailors.

What does privacy in the age of the internet look like? A few
teachers in the United States are grappling with this question after being
suspended or fired for posting private adult content on the website 'OnlyFans,'
where users paid them to access their pictures or videos. However, there are
many questions surrounding situations like these -- where employees, in this
case teachers, are being punished for things done in their personal lives that
aren't considered illegal, but could be disapproved of. On the Rundown,
Employment Law Attorney Derek J. Demeri explains how much say an employer has
when it comes to what an employee does in their free time and how it may impact
their profession. He also discusses how often people turn to making adult
content to produce a second income and the role that privacy law precedence
plays in cases like these.

Plus, commentary from comedian and FOX News contributor Tom
Shillue.

      <title>Evening Edition: Fewer Donating During The Holidays </title>
      <description>While holiday donations have slightly risen since last year the number of people donating what they can has gone down. 'GivingTuesday' tells FOX News donations were up twenty million dollars but the number of donors is down which they call a warning sign for future years. The Salvation Army has turned to pushing donors to use apps like Venmo and Apple Pay for an easier way to donate.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Madison Alworth, FOX Business Network national correspondent, who spoke with the Salvation Army today about their concerns and offers some reasons on why Americans feel less generous this holiday season.

      <title>"A Red Alarm Moment For The Democratic Party": Biden Poll Numbers Sink</title>
      <description>Voters continue to lose faith in President Joe Biden after multiple high-profile issues on the world stage and Americans' poor perception of the economy. The Biden White House sees the poor approval ratings and is attempting to recalibrate ahead of 2024. Recent Fox News polling forecasts that the President could lose in a rematch against former President Donald Trump in November. Fox News Radio's Political Analyst Josh Kraushaaur joins the Rundown to break down the numbers, share why Joe Biden continues to lose supporters among his base, and explain why Trump still dominates with Republicans.

It’s “the most wonderful time of the year” for some, but that can all be upended for holiday travelers, who have faced severe airport delays and cancellations in recent years. The U.S. Department of Transportation this week slapped Southwest Airlines with a $140 million fine for their historic holiday flight shutdown in 2022 that left over two million travelers stranded. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg joined the podcast to explain how this fine will send a message to all airlines that they must take care of their passengers.

Plus, commentary by Fox &amp; Friends co-host and host of The Brian Kilmeade Show, Brian Kilmeade.

      <title>Evening Edition: The U.S. Wants A Red Sea Task Force Formed To Combat Cargo Ship Attacks  </title>
      <description>The United States is speaking with partner countries in efforts to form a 'Red Sea Task' force which would protect cargo vessels in the important waterway that links Europe to Asia. Between pirates and an increase in drone and missile attacks on ships by Houthi rebels in Yemen, there is a growing list of companies that have decided to halt shipping through the Red Sea because of the danger. The USS Carney has shot down dozens of Houthi drones and missiles while Iran warned the proposed task force will cause "extraordinary problems" in the region.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Katherine Zimmerman, fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) following trends in the Middle East and Africa, who says this level of policing the Red Sea will be a difficult job while not expanding the existing conflicts in the region.

      <title>Rep. Jim Jordan On Why Impeachment Inquiry Is House Republicans’ “Congressional Duty”</title>
      <description>Though Hunter Biden arrived on Capitol Hill at 9:30 AM on Wednesday, following a subpoena from House Republicans calling him to testify at a House Oversight Committee deposition, the President’s son didn’t go. He instead addressed the press on the Senate side of the Capitol — stating he refused to attend a closed-door deposition and that his father, President Biden, was not “financially involved” in his business dealings. Now, Americans wait to see what consequences Hunter may face, especially now that House Republicans have formally issued their impeachment inquiry into the President. On the Rundown, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH), who has played a significant role in the Biden family investigation, discusses why he believes Hunter did what he did, how Republicans are moving forward with their investigation, and his response to claims that House Republicans should be focusing on issues impacting Americans instead of an impeachment inquiry.

Are Americans getting tired of tipping? With inflationary prices and economic uncertainty, reports show some in the country are growing confused by and, in some cases, resentful of tipping expectations. This year, reported income from tips is down from its previous spike during the pandemic. As gratuity pop-up screens become more common on tablets in restaurants and other locations, customers are pushing back. On the Rundown, Emily Guy Birkin, financial expert and co-author of “Stacked: Your Super Serious Guide to Modern Money Management,” breaks down who you should tip, what services deserve gratuity, and why not tipping your barista is okay.

Plus, commentary by Fox News Medical Contributor and author of “Panic Attack,” Dr. Nicole Saphier.

      <title>Extra: How China Is Targeting Our Grid And Water Supply</title>
      <description>FBI Director Christopher Wray says China is currently the most significant threat facing the United States--especially when it comes to cybersecurity. 
Underscoring that is a recent Washington Post report that says China has infiltrated critical infrastructure systems in the U.S., making our power grid or water supply vulnerable to a cyber-attack. 
On the Rundown, Matthew Kroenig, Vice President and Senior Director for the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security for the Atlantic Council, explained to host Dave Anthony how China's cyber tactics suggest the nation is preparing for war.
Kroenig discusses the strategy behind China's cyberwar efforts and how they find weaknesses in our private and public online networks.
The foreign policy expert also discussed what companies and government workers must do to improve their cyber practices and be ready to counter an attack from a foreign adversary. 
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with the Atlantic Council's Matthew Kroenig. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even about China and other country's cyberwarfare tactics and what America must do to prepare for a future conflict.

      <title>From Washington: House Adjourns Amid Tensions With Biden Administration</title>
      <description>The House of Representatives has adjourned, most likely concluding sessions for the year. President Biden expressed frustration with lawmakers, blaming wasted time on internal matters like finding a new Speaker and an impeachment inquiry, he criticized Republicans for focusing on attacking him rather than assisting Americans. Despite this, the White House hasn't delved much into the impeachment process or the subpoena defiance by Hunter Biden. FOX News White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich shares her reporting.

Migrants from around the world are converging at the Southern border, fueling a humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, Congress is at an impasse as Republican lawmakers have refused to pass Ukraine aid without stronger security at the U.S.-Mexico border. FOX News Washington-based Correspondent and co-anchor of FOX News Live Griff Jenkins is joined by independent border journalist Auden Cabello. They explain the reasons for the increased activity at the border and discuss the impact the crossings are having on urban centers in the United States.

      <title>From Washington: Governor Sununu &amp; The Power of Endorsements</title>
      <description>Earlier this week, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley received a noteworthy endorsement from New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu (R-NH) just weeks before the state's GOP primary. However, former President Donald Trump continues to dominate the polls in Iowa and The Granite State, questioning how much a governor's endorsement matters. Governor Sununu weighs in on why he decided to endorse Haley and why he insists his state's primary will be first despite the Democratic National Committee trying to change the rules.

Congress had a busy week, as tempers flared over negotiations for funding for Ukraine aid and border security. The President’s son Hunter Biden also made an appearance on the Senate side of Congress, avoiding a House subpoena as they investigate his overseas business deals. FOX News Congressional Correspondent Aishah Hasnie joins FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram as they recap the week on Capitol Hill, explain what legal action Congress can take against Hunter Biden, and share details on the ongoing negotiations to fund the government.

      <title>A High-Stakes Impeachment Inquiry For Both Parties</title>
      <description>House Republicans have approved launching an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, making him the fifth president ever subjected to one. On Wednesday, every House Republican voted in favor of the inquiry, while every Democrat voted against it. Fox News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to break down the latest in the Hunter Biden investigation and crucial Supreme Court cases involving former President Trump.

A test for free speech in some communities this holiday season, with Satanic worshippers insisting their displays be featured next to all the other religious groups. In an Iowa Capitol building, there was backlash against the Satanic holiday display; however, state officials claimed they could not “discriminate on the basis of religion.” On the podcast, Heritage Foundation’s Senior Legal Fellow and former DOJ attorney Hans von Spakovsky joins to explain exactly what the First Amendment says about religious displays and the embattled history of courts settling controversies about separation of church and state.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary by Gary Schneeberger, co-author of 'The Films of Bruce Willis.'

      <title>Evening Edition: Military Leaders Focus On Gaza At Doha Forum</title>
      <description>The annual 'Doha Forum' took place this week in Qatar with representatives from around the world coming together to discuss military and diplomatic relationships. This year's forum comes at a time of major conflict with wars in Europe and the Middle East which made the absence of a administration official from the United States even more noticed. Much of the conference dealt with the war between Israel and Hamas with Russia, China and Iran all heaping blame on Washington.

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Daniel Hoffman, former CIA Chief of Station and  FOX News contributor, who attended the forum and shares the lead topics of the event.

      <title>Inflation Eases, But Some High Prices Are Here To Stay</title>
      <description>The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that
they're done raising interest rates and could even cut them in 2024. However,
despite the good news just in time for the holidays, Americans are still
feeling the effects of inflation, with the cost of many everyday items
significantly higher than just a few years ago. Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at
Moody's Analytics, discusses the state of the economy, why prices for some
services and items will never decline, and the likelihood of the U.S. entering
a recession next year.

As online shopping becomes more popular around
the holidays, scammers are developing smarter and sneakier ways to steal your
information. If you're looking to buy gifts for family and friends, donate to
charities, or even adopt a furry friend this holiday season, knowing how to
ensure that you're using reliable sources and keeping your information
protected is crucial. On the Rundown, Director of PR and Social Media at the
Better Business Bureau Melanie McGovern discusses the most popular scams to
look out for when scrolling on social media or ordering online and how to tell
if the charity you're donating to is authentic.

Plus, commentary by Jason Rantz, Host of the
Jason Rantz Show and author of "What's Killing America."

they're done raising interest rates and could even cut them in 2024. However,
despite the good news just in time for the holidays, Americans are still
feeling the effects of inflation, with the cost of many everyday items
significantly higher than just a few years ago. Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at
Moody's Analytics, discusses the state of the economy, why prices for some
services and items will never decline, and the likelihood of the U.S. entering
a recession next year.

As online shopping becomes more popular around
the holidays, scammers are developing smarter and sneakier ways to steal your
information. If you're looking to buy gifts for family and friends, donate to
charities, or even adopt a furry friend this holiday season, knowing how to
ensure that you're using reliable sources and keeping your information
protected is crucial. On the Rundown, Director of PR and Social Media at the
Better Business Bureau Melanie McGovern discusses the most popular scams to
look out for when scrolling on social media or ordering online and how to tell
if the charity you're donating to is authentic.

Plus, commentary by Jason Rantz, Host of the
Jason Rantz Show and author of "What's Killing America."

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Nate Foy, FOX News correspondent currently in Northern Israel, about the latest in fighting and the process of flooding the terrorist tunnels.

      <title>Voters Reckon With Endorsements, Foreign Aid, &amp; A Likely Impeachment Inquiry</title>
      <description>Before Congress heads to winter break for the rest of 2023, there are some big decisions that remain to be made. Will Republicans launch a formal impeachment inquiry into President Biden? Can the Democrats and GOP agree on funding both foreign aid to Ukraine and U.S. border security? And how much will New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu’s endorsement of former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley impact the GOP primary? FOX News Decision Desk Director Arnon Mishkin joins the Rundown to break down these uncertain factors that could soon play a big role in voters’ decisions in 2024.

FBI Director Christopher Wray says China is currently the most significant threat facing the United States--especially when it comes to cybersecurity. Recent reporting by the Washington Post shows that China continues to attack critical infrastructure in the U.S., including both public and private targets. On the Rundown, Matthew Kroenig, Vice President and Senior Director for the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security for the Atlantic Council, explains how China appears to be preparing for war, where our infrastructure systems are vulnerable, and why companies must improve their cyber practices.

Plus, commentary from FOX News contributor Joe Concha.

      <title>Evening Edition: Zelenskyy Visits Washington As Congress Stalled On More Ukraine Aid  </title>
      <description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Washington D.C. today speaking with lawmakers and President Biden making his case for billions more in aid in his country's fight against the Russian invaders. Zelenskyy is asking for Congress to approve $61.4 billion for Ukraine that also includes aid to Israel. The United States has already sent $111 billion to Ukraine and the prediction is Congress won't be able to pass an aid package before the holidays which has Kyiv and the White House worried.

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Rear Admiral (Ret.) Mark Montgomery, Senior Fellow at the nonpartisan think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies and served as policy director for the Senate Armed Services Committee, about what could be in this possible latest round of aid to Ukraine and the impact of getting it or not getting it.

      <title>Hunter’s Legal Trouble Put More Pressure On President</title>
      <description>President Biden's son Hunter has been indicted on nine tax-related charges in addition to several federal charges filed over the summer, the latest in the five-year-long investigation. Meanwhile, the House is seeking to formally impeach the president over his involvement with his son's overseas business dealings. Fox News contributor and former Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy says that the Biden name had a much bigger impact on Hunter Biden's business proceedings than what the White House has let on. He joins the Rundown to explain the latest indictment and how Hunter Biden earned a “sweetheart deal” over the summer.

The average cost of child care in America is estimated to be about $10,000 per child, leaving many working parents either struggling to provide for their families or wondering if working is worth it when so much of their salary goes toward childcare. This dilemma has impacted the workforce; however, companies are coming up with creative solutions to address this problem. On the Rundown, Tyson Foods Associate Director of Human Resources Garrett Dolan explains how his company is offering affordable on-site childcare for workers, the positive impacts it's had on those at Tyson Foods, and his thoughts on whether more companies will start offering programs like this across the U.S.

Plus, commentary by a former investment banker and author of 'You Will Own Nothing,' Carol Roth.

      <title>Border Crisis Is “Ending Up In Everybody’s Backyard”</title>
      <description>From border states like Texas and Arizona to sanctuary cities like New York and Chicago — the southern border crisis continues worsening across the U.S. With this comes increasing concerns from House Republicans about the number of children being trafficked across the border or being taken advantage of by bad actors. Iowa Congresswoman Ashley Hinson is addressing this severe issue with the PRINTS Act, a bill that, if passed, would allow border patrol agents to fingerprint non-citizens crossing the border under the age of 14 to ensure children are identified and cannot easily be harmed or used repeatedly by those with ill intentions. On the Rundown, Rep. Hinson explains why addressing the border crisis is such a huge priority for her and how important it is that the Biden Administration acknowledge the severity of the situation. She also discusses how her constituents in Iowa are feeling about the Republican presidential candidates who are aiming to win over Iowans before the Iowa caucuses on January 15.

A new study reveals that one out of every five school-aged children takes melatonin to fall asleep. As the supplement increases in popularity, there are growing concerns about the long-term effects it has on the body. However, due to this being a supplement which is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, the market is flooded with similar products of varying quality. FOX News Medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel joins to break down how melatonin works, why people should prioritize better sleep habits, and the importance of parents consulting a doctor before giving their children supplements.

Plus, commentary by orthodox rabbi, author, and lawyer Sam Bregman.

However, due to this being a supplement which is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, the market is flooded with similar products of varying quality. FOX News Medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel joins to break down how melatonin works, why people should prioritize better sleep habits, and the importance of parents consulting a doctor before giving their children supplements.

        <![CDATA[<p>From border states like Texas and Arizona to sanctuary cities like New York and Chicago — the southern border crisis continues worsening across the U.S. With this comes increasing concerns from House Republicans about the number of children being trafficked across the border or being taken advantage of by bad actors. Iowa Congresswoman Ashley Hinson is addressing this severe issue with the PRINTS Act, a bill that, if passed, would allow border patrol agents to fingerprint non-citizens crossing the border under the age of 14 to ensure children are identified and cannot easily be harmed or used repeatedly by those with ill intentions. On the Rundown, Rep. Hinson explains why addressing the border crisis is such a huge priority for her and how important it is that the Biden Administration acknowledge the severity of the situation. She also discusses how her constituents in Iowa are feeling about the Republican presidential candidates who are aiming to win over Iowans before the Iowa caucuses on January 15.</p><p><br></p><p>A new study reveals that one out of every five school-aged children takes melatonin to fall asleep.

      <title>From Washington: Impeachment, It's All About The Math</title>
      <description>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) announced his departure from Congress this week, creating a numbers problem for his party as House Republicans maintain a narrow majority. Nonetheless, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has maintained that Republicans have the votes to pass a resolution to formalize an impeachment inquiry into President Biden. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram examines the potential impact the probe could have on the party's slim majority.

On Monday, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the arrest of ex-U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia Victor Manuel Rocha. Rocha acted as a foreign agent for Cuba while working for the U.S. government. FOX News Contributor and retired CIA Clandestine Services officer Dan Hoffman discusses what's next for U.S. intelligence agencies and shares why although the investigation may be over, the damage is only beginning.

      <title>Extra: "Congress Has Become A Collection Of Kardashians"</title>
      <description>Long-time California congressman Kevin McCarthy is leaving Congress at the end of the year.

The announcement came less than two months after the historic House vote to oust him as Speaker.
 
That motion to vacate was supported by Democrats but led by eight of his fellow Republicans who took issue with his handling of spending issues.
 
After the three weeks of GOP infighting, Mike Johnson eventually emerged as McCarthy's replacement as House speaker.

McCarthy's exit means the GOP's slim majority will get even slimmer. 
 
Shortly after the news broke, FOX News Rundown host Lisa Brady spoke with Trey Gowdy, former South Carolina congressman, host of The Trey Gowdy podcast, and host of Sunday Night in America on the FOX News Channel.
 
Gowdy weighed in on his friend's retirement, the state of our political system, and why he thinks the dysfunction in Congress is discouraging good people from running for office.
 
He compared many lawmakers to the celebrity family, the Kardashians, accusing them of being more interested in getting attention than passing laws.
 
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Trey Gowdy. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear all of our fiery interview with the FOX host and former Congressman and get even more of his take on what he says is wrong with Washington.

      <title>From Washington: Abandon Biden Campaign Grows In Key Swing States</title>
      <description>The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres says that nowhere in Gaza is safe and urges for a ceasefire, warning that conditions in the region continue to deteriorate as a result of the fighting. Fighting paused temporarily last month, however, the conditions that allowed a ceasefire, no longer exist because Hamas refuses to release civilian women. Over 130 hostages remain trapped in Gaza, including several Americans. John Kirby, Coordinator for Strategic Communications at the White House National Security Council, shares details about the war in Gaza and the Biden administration's push for continued aid to Ukraine.
Muslim Americans in swing states have been revoking their vote for President Biden next year due to his handling of the Israel-Hamas war, launching their own campaign called "Abandon Biden." While just over one percent of Americans are estimated to be Muslim, swing states such as Michigan and Georgia have a high population of Arab Americans, where the President won by a slim majority in 2020. Will Muslim American anger hurt his re-election in 2024? Democratic Strategist and Co-Host of The Five Jessica Tarlov speculates as to whether President Biden should rethink his stance on the divisive war, to save his campaign.

      <title>DeSantis and Haley Spar For Second Ahead Of Iowa Contest</title>
      <description>Former President Donald Trump remains the GOP front-runner despite not sparring with his fellow candidates during the fourth Republican primary debate. With a few weeks left until the Iowa caucus, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis went on the offensive against former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, as the pair compete for a crucial second-place win in the Hawkeye State. Co-anchor of America Reports, Sandra Smith, joins the Rundown to analyze the candidates' performance and break down the latest polling showing President Biden's approval ratings have sunk.

In October, there was a reported breach of the genetic testing company '23AndMe,' confirmed when a hacker posted that they had obtained the data of 1 million users of Jewish Ashkenazi descent and one hundred thousand Chinese users. Two weeks later, the same hackers reported having four million users' data—and now the company has come forward, admitting 6.9 million people's data has been exposed. On the Rundown, founder and CEO of Applied AIC and cyber security expert John Cofrancesco explains how the hackers used the dark web to access the usernames and passwords of users to hack into their accounts and what harm could be done if this information lands in the wrong hands.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary from host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

In October, there was a reported breach of the genetic testing company '23AndMe,' confirmed when a hacker posted that they had obtained the data of 1 million users of Jewish Ashkenazi descent and one hundred thousand Chinese users. Two weeks later, the same hackers reported having four million users' data—and now the company has come forward, admitting 6.9 million people's data has been exposed. On the Rundown, founder and CEO of Applied AIC and cyber security expert John Cofrancesco explains how the hackers used the dark web to access the usernames and passwords of users to hack into their accounts and what harm could be done if this information lands in the wrong hands.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

      <title>"There Are Others To Come": Trey Gowdy Raises Alarms Over McCarthy Retirement</title>
      <description>Ousted former speaker, Congressman Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), will retire after 17 years in the House and will leave at the end of 2023, before the end of his term. The former South Carolina Congressman and host of The Trey Gowdy Podcast and Sunday Night In America on the Fox News Channel joins the Rundown to discuss the retirement of friend and former Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. He explains why the ousting of former Speaker McCarthy demonstrated how political division in Washington has made governing impossible, the likelihood of more congressional retirements as a consequence of Capitol Hill dysfunction, and his faith that Kevin McCarthy will be “fabulously successful” after leaving Congress.

Thursday marks two months since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war on Hamas following the terrorist group's brutal surprise attack. As the war continues to rage in Gaza, the focus has shifted to civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis, with pro-Palestinian protests persisting across the country. Meanwhile, these demonstrations have included some hate speech, which has left American and Israeli Jews feeling threatened as they witness surging antisemitism. Tal Heinrich, spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, joins the Rundown to discuss what went wrong leading up to October 7th, the horrible conditions the Israeli hostages are facing, and Israel's commitment to destroy Hamas.

Plus, commentary from founder and president of the World War II Foundation, Tim Gray.

      <title>Is Antisemitic Speech on University Campuses Protected Speech?</title>
      <description>Should antisemitic speech be protected as free speech on college campuses in the U.S.? This is one of the questions the university presidents of Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania had to grapple with before the House Education and Workforce Committee yesterday. If Jewish students are afraid to go to class due to their peers' behavior, where should the line be drawn? On the Rundown, Attorney Mark Ressler, whose firm has filed two lawsuits against major universities over antisemitism on college campuses, discusses why his firm has taken action to address antisemitic speech on college campuses, how the university presidents testified before Congress, and his thoughts on why this seems to be happening more at Ivy League schools.


Despite the Biden administration's continuous push for electric vehicles, the demand is steadily declining. The White House declared a goal to make two-thirds of all cars in the U.S. electric by 2030; however, reliable charging stations that these cars depend on are still few and far between. Wall Street Journal auto industry reporter Michael Colias joins to break down why the demand has dropped, explain why many people are hesitant to purchase an electric car and share why many fear the impact EV chargers have on the environment.


Plus, commentary from Will Cain.

      <title>A.I. and The Chipping Away Of Our Trust In Media</title>
      <description>Artificial intelligence is being utilized by more and more industries, with many seeing the convenient and revolutionary nature of the tool. However, some are calling out new uses of this new tech that are proving to be unethical. Last month, Sports Illustrated dealt with allegations that many of their recent articles were produced by AI, calling into question the publication's credibility. Howard Kurtz, the host of Media Buzz and the Media Buzzmeter podcast, joins the Rundown to discuss what Sports Illustrated did wrong and shared why AI could be a powerful tool for journalists if used correctly.

The Supreme Court is currently deciding whether OxyContin-producer Purdue Pharma's proposed $6 billion bankruptcy settlement is just. This money, which aims to address the opioid crisis and repay families who have been personally impacted by opioids, initially sounded like a good deal to many Americans, but the payments would be stretched out over 18 years — and would allow the family behind Purdue Pharma to walk away scot-free. On the Rundown, Bill Nelson, who lost his 20-year-old stepson Brian to an opioid overdose, explains why he's against the deal and would rather the head of the company, Richard Sackler, be "locked up in a jail cell" than this settlement go through.

Plus, commentary by Fox Nation host Tammy Bruce.

      <title>House Majority Whip Tom Emmer Talks George Santos Expulsion &amp; Potential Biden Impeachment Inquiry</title>
      <description>House Republicans have been digging into the Biden family's allegedly questionable business dealings for months, and they're now taking things a step further — working towards authorizing a formal impeachment inquiry into the President to strengthen House Republicans' legal standing in court while their investigation continues. Meanwhile, George Santos became the sixth member of the House to be expelled in Congressional history, making the GOP's already slim majority in the House even smaller — leading to some concerns that Republicans in the House may have even more trouble passing their agenda. On the Rundown, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) explains why opening an impeachment inquiry into the President is both reasonable and necessary based on the evidence revealed, and why many Republicans, including himself, voted against Santos' expulsion. He also adds why he believes House Republicans still have the power to band together and get the job done despite losing a number in their majority.

With just over a month left before the Iowa caucus, former United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has found herself neck-and-neck with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R-FL). As her candidacy grows stronger, big-name donors are taking an interest. The Americans For Prosperity PAC, backed by billionaire Charles Koch, officially endorsed Haley's campaign last week. The Northeast Regional Director of Women for Nikki, Jennifer Nassour, joins the podcast to discuss Haley's recent strong polling and what her latest endorsement means for the Haley campaign.

Plus, commentary from New York Post columnist and co-author of "The Canceling of the American Mind," Rikki Schlott.

      <title>Extra: Benjamin Hall On His Return To Ukraine</title>
      <description>FOX correspondent Benjamin Hall almost died while covering the Ukraine war when he was struck during a Russian missile attack.
Since his rescue from the warzone nearly two years ago, he has undergone dozens of surgeries and undergone countless amounts of rehabilitation. 
Last month, Hall returned to Ukraine for the first time, where he sat down with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the current state of the war. 
Hall joined host Dave Anthony after his trip to discuss his return, his interview with Zelensky, and the launch of his new podcast, "Searching for Heroes."
Hall weighed in on the war in Ukraine and how for many Americans, it has been overshadowed by the war in Israel. He also discussed his passion for journalism and the importance of war reporting. 
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with FOX News' Ben Hall. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear more about Ben's inspiring story.

      <title>From Washington: White House Tackles Supply Chain Challenges</title>
      <description>A President's approval rating is often a reflection of Americans' attitudes on the economy. That's why President Biden has been traveling the country attempting to assure Americans that the economy is doing well. Earlier this week, he convened the first meeting of the White House Council on Supply Chain Resilience. Chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors Jared Bernstein discusses his work on the new council and outlines the administration's strategy to tamper down on inflation.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and California Gavin Newsom (D-CA) went head-to-head during the Red State-Blue State Debate moderated by Sean Hannity earlier this week on the FOX News Channel. The pair took the stage to spar over both states' differing politics. However, it remains unclear whether or not the debate helped or hurt Governor DeSantis, who is actively running for president. Republican Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and Democratic Strategist and FOX News Contributor Leslie Marshall break down the governors' performances and evaluate each state's differing policies.

      <title>Extra: The "Mass Exodus" In Congress</title>
      <description>More than three dozen members of Congress, most in the House, but six senators have announced their retirement.
While some are running for other seats and offices, some say their decisions were motivated by the chaos and dysfunction on Capitol Hill.
We recently spoke to FOX News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar, who has covered Congress for years, about why so many lawmakers are leaving.
Josh explained how the changes could make for some interesting races and how the balance of power could shake up yet again.
We bring you plenty of fresh interviews each day during the week, and sometimes we have more to share, like this one.
On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear for the first time our interview with FOX News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar and get his take on Congress' 'mass exodus' and what it says about the state of politics in America ... and what impact it can have on 2024.

      <title>From Washington: Trailblazer Justice Sandra Day O'Connor Dies </title>
      <description>Former Congressman George Santos was expelled by the House Of Representatives this week, as he faces federal charges for fraud and embezzling campaign funds. With the Republican majority down one less member, they head into a fight over government funding. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the historic measure Congress took in expelling Santos, how retirements in the Republican Party impact the next election cycle, and what Santos’ expulsion could mean for the fight over the federal budget. 
 
Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor passed away Friday morning from dementia-related complications and a respiratory infection. Justice O'Connor was the 102nd Supreme Court Justice, but the first female to be sworn in with that title. FOX News Contributor and Law Professor at George Washington University Jonathan Turley discusses some of Justice O'Connor's most influential decisions and opinions and reflects on the legacy she leaves behind.

      <title>Congress Confronts Its Santos Problem</title>
      <description>Congressman George Santos (R-NY) faces a 23-count federal indictment for identity theft of his campaign donors and covertly stealing their money. The House Ethics Committee issued a report saying they found "overwhelming evidence" of Santos breaking the law and that "he can't be trusted." Congress plans to vote to expel Santos from the House on Friday. FOX News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to discuss why GOP lawmakers fear they will lose the majority if Santos is ousted, how Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) spending bill became just a "band-aid," and why nearly three dozen lawmakers are leaving Congress.

Credit card debt is growing out of control in America, with a recent report showing Americans now have over 1 trillion dollars in credit card debt. How did it get to this point? Ted Rossman is a senior industry analyst at Bankrate, and he joins the podcast to explain what’s behind this historic rise in credit card debt, what this may mean for holiday spending, and the likely consequences for American debt in the future.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary by former Congressman Jason Chaffetz, host of the Jason in the House podcast.

      <title>Evening Edition: Elon Musk Says Advertisers Are Trying To Blackmail Him </title>
      <description>Elon Musk, speaking at a conference in New York, apologized for a recent tweet endorsing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory but then attacked the companies who dropped their advertising because of it. Musk claims those companies are trying to blackmail him and used an expletive to let him know how he feels. This on the heels of a visit to Israel that some have called 'an apology tour.'

FOX’s John Saucier speaks with Kelly O'Grady, FOX Business Network correspondent, who takes a look at this aggressive behavior and what it could mean to 'X'.

      <title>Red State Versus Blue State On The Debate Stage</title>
      <description>On Thursday night, it's a battle of the red
states versus the blue states. On Fox News, Sean Hannity will moderate a debate
between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and California Governor Gavin Newsom.
During the event, Governor DeSantis, a candidate for the 2024 GOP presidential
nomination, is sure to be speaking directly to primary voters about his vision
for the country. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds is a red state governor herself,
and she has endorsed DeSantis ahead of her state's first-in-the-nation caucus.
On the Rundown, Gov. Reynolds previews what red state strengths DeSantis is
likely to emphasize during the debate and unpacks her decision to endorse
Governor DeSantis.

FOX correspondent Benjamin Hall almost died
reporting on the war front in Ukraine nearly two years ago. Since his rescue
from the warzone, he has undergone dozens of surgeries and countless amounts of
rehabilitation to make a strong recovery. Earlier this month, Hall went back to
Ukraine, where he sat down with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the
current state of the war. He joins the podcast to discuss his return and the
launch of his new podcast, "Searching for Heroes."

Plus, commentary by
former Trump economic adviser and economist at the Heritage Foundation, Steve
Moore.

      <title>The Real Cost Of The Migrant Crisis</title>
      <description>Over 2.4 million migrants entered the United States last fiscal year, and the numbers continue to rise. U.S. Customs and Border Protection estimates there were more than one thousand 'known gotaways' each day last month, adding to the already heavy burden border communities now face. FOX Business correspondent Madison Alworth joins the Rundown to describe her ride along with the Texas Department of Public Safety, what methods migrants are using to enter the United States, and breaks down a recent House GOP report estimating that $451 billion American tax dollars are being used to support migrants.

Over three dozen U.S. lawmakers have announced they won’t be seeking reelection, with thirteen of them announcing that just in the month of November. Reports have theorized that this exodus of representatives and lawmakers is due to dysfunction and division in Washington. Congressman Brad Wenstrup (R-OH) is retiring himself, and he dispels those rumors, saying his was a family decision. He discusses the historic challenges faced by the House, his plans for life after Washington, and his hopes for America’s future.

Plus, commentary by Jason Rantz, Host of the Jason Rantz Show and author of "What’s Killing America."

      <title>Evening Edition: Holiday Shopping Starts With Few Deals And More Debt</title>
      <description>Record breaking retail sales this 'Black Friday' and 'Cyber Monday' as both days had online sales increase from last year by seven to ten percent but those numbers are expected to shrink during the holiday season. Sales growth for the rest of the rest of the holidays is predicted drop nearly three percent from last year. Shoppers, mostly unhappy with the deals offered, seem to be using more credit as the ninety-day credit card delinquency rate is on the rise as well as the use of 'Buy Now, Pay Later' programs. 

FOX’s John Saucier speaks with Grady Trimble, FOX Business Network correspondent, about the lackluster deal days and how Americans are racking up spending debt at historic levels.

      <title>What It’s Like Knowing Hamas Is Holding Your Family Hostage</title>
      <description>On October 7th, Dori Roberts received the horrible news that five of his relatives were kidnapped during Hamas’ brutal attack on Israel. For weeks the Israeli American feared the worst knowing his family members were being held hostage by the terror organization. Three of them were finally freed last Friday as part of the negotiations mediated by Qatar. Dori Roberts talks to the Rundown to discuss his family’s ordeal and what is being done to help release his remaining family members.

Most of Kansas’ court systems have been offline for over a month thanks to what is being called a ‘sophisticated foreign cyberattack.’ According to the Kansas Supreme Court, cybercriminals have stolen sensitive data and are now threatening to post it online. Michael Balboni, a former New York Homeland Security Advisor and the Managing Director of RedLand Strategies, discusses how ransomware and other cyber-attacks work, who is typically behind themselves, and how both institutions and individuals can protect themselves 
 
Plus, commentary from host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Evening Edition: What Is Qatar's Role In Israel-Hamas Hostage Negotiations?  </title>
      <description>A ceasefire fire truce between Israel and Hamas has been extended by two more days as the terror group released another group of hostages. Qatar has stepped in as the major mediator in hostage negotiations but also has a long history of supporting terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. So, what are Qatar's real reasons for pushing for the release of hostages and why does Hamas seemingly listen to Doha's representatives?

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Dr. Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president for research at Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and author of 'Gaza Conflict 2021: Hamas, Israel and Eleven Days of War,' about Qatar's support of terror groups and what do they get out of being the lead liaison of Hamas?

      <title>What Happens After Israel's Temporary Cease-fire?</title>
      <description>Families are rejoicing after many innocent people taken hostage by Hamas were released as a result of Israel's four-day ceasefire that was declared last Friday. President Biden has said his goal is to keep this pause going to allow for more hostages to be released and humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. However, many are afraid Hamas can't be trusted to keep the peace. On the Rundown, Congresswoman Claudia Tenney (R-NY) explains how she believes Hamas may "manipulate and abuse" the opportunity Israel has given them with this ceasefire and why this likely will not lead to a sooner end to the war. She also discusses the recent car explosion at the U.S.-Canada border and how it echoes the need for better security at our northern border, the fight over government funding in Washington, and how the migrant crisis continues impacting her state.

As a result of the pandemic, students across the United States have been suffering from learning loss, and national test scores have been down dramatically. In the 2022-2023 school year, the Nation's Report Card showed the average test score for thirteen-year-olds dropped nine points in math and four in reading, compared to 2019. However, there are exceptions to America's education problem. The Early College at Guilford in Greensboro, North Carolina, appears to overcome the challenges of the pandemic and was recently named the best high school in America by U.S. News and World Report. The school's principal, Pete Kashubara, joins the Rundown to discuss what contributed to the school's success.

Plus, commentary by FOX News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett.

      <title>Extra: The Age-Old Question About President Biden</title>
      <description>President Joe Biden turned 81 years old this past week, making him the oldest person to serve as commander-in-chief. His birthday put an even brighter spotlight on the age issue that seems to be plaguing his poll numbers.
 
Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, joined the Rundown's Dave Anthony to discuss the growing concern among Democrats over Biden being over the hill and incapable of serving four more years.
 
Kondik also explained how other factors are playing into Biden's struggles, including voters being dissatisfied with his handling of the economy. However, he does note there is still time for the President to turn things around and why another Democrat replacing him on the ballot does not seem likely.
 
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with political analyst Kyle Kondik. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more of his take on the 2024 race and why President Biden's reelection campaign appears to be an uphill battle.

      <title>From Washington: GOP Hopefuls Look to Upend Trump in Iowa</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/11/26/from-washington-gop-hopefuls-look-to-upend-trump-in-iowa/</link>
      <description>President Joe Biden turned 81 last week. However, the celebration only brought attention to a recent AP-NORC poll indicating that nearly 80 percent of Americans think he is too old to serve a second term. Yet, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says there aren't any behind-the-scenes worries about the President's old age. Democratic pollster and CEO of Schoen Cooperman Research, Carly Cooperman joins to break down voters' concerns about Biden’s age and explain why his campaign is eager to dispute claims that another Democratic hopeful will emerge soon. 
 
With the Iowa Republican presidential caucuses less than two months away, former President Trump remains the overwhelming frontrunner in both the Hawkeye state and national polls. The Republican presidential hopefuls may need to upend Trump there if they want to have any chance of winning the nomination. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently won the endorsements of Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Evangelical conservative leader in the state. Some Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove discusses where the candidates stand ahead of the caucus and explains why endorsements can make or break a campaign.

      <title>Extra: Brian Kilmeade Unedited</title>
      <description>Besides hosting multiple TV shows and a radio show for FOX News, Brian Kilmeade has written multiple books about America's history and the people who shaped our country.
 
His latest release is, "Teddy and Booker T.: How Two American Icons Blazed a Path for Racial Equality." It looks back at the relationship between President Theodore Roosevelt and Booker T Washington, a former slave who became an educator, an advisor to presidents, and a leader in the African American community.
 
Recently Brian Kilmeade joined FOX News Rundown host Dave Anthony to discuss the book and why he decided to focus on how that unlikely relationship impacted race relations in America.
 
Kilmeade also weighed in on the ongoing war between Israel and Gaza and the importance of knowing the region's complex history. Kilmeade believes some of the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic protests are being fueled by misinformation about Israel.

      <title>From Washington: Americans Wishing For A "Soft Landing" This Holiday Season</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/11/25/from-washington-americans-wishing-for-a-soft-landing-this-holiday-season/</link>
      <description>The Federal Reserve is holding off on rate hikes as they monitor inflation, which has gradually steadied over previous months. Many experts believe a "soft landing" for the economy is becoming more likely, but recession worries remain. Managing Director and Senior Portfolio Manager at UBS Jason Katz joins to discuss the economic factors the Fed is focused on, what consumer spending tells us about the economic climate, and if further rate hikes could be coming in the future.
 
President Biden spared two lucky turkeys from the Thanksgiving table this week as he presided over the 76th annual Presidential Turkey Pardon. President and CEO of the National Turkey Federation Joel Brandenberger joins to discuss the history of the decades-old tradition, from the first official pardon in 1947 by President Truman, to President Biden's pardon of this year's turkeys, Liberty and Bell.

      <title>Is Black Friday Still A Big Deal?</title>
      <description>The holiday shopping season has officially begun with an estimated 130 million people planning to “shop 'til they drop” this Black Friday. But the deals are no longer restricted to Friday, with many retailers rolling out holiday discounts earlier this month. This change is causing some to question whether or not Black Friday is still the best day for discounts. Founder and CEO of Storch Advisors, Gerald Storch, joins the Rundown to explain why he thinks Black Friday is more of a "concept" and not a holiday, why consumers are spending more right now, and share why he believes it will be a slow holiday season for retailers.

Nearly forty percent of adults in the United States are considered obese, and many people are looking for a quick and easy way to lose weight. Ozempic, a popular drug used to treat diabetes, skyrocketed in popularity after celebrities began using it for weight loss. Now, doctors fear the long-term effects the drug may have on the world of health and fitness. FOX News Medical contributor and NYU Langone professor Dr. Marc Siegel explains how these drugs work, how overprescription of these drugs will hurt diabetes patients who need them, and how Ozempic became such a sought-after drug.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary by a former investment banker and author of 'You Will Own Nothing,' Carol Roth.

      <description>There are five so-called 'Blue Zones' in the world where people live much longer than expected with somewhat of ease. The people living in these places are not obsessed with strict diets and exercise, it is more just their way of life. We speak to an expert on these 'blue zones' who says there is much we can learn from these cultures which we could apply to our own lives.
FOX's Alex Hogan speaks with Dan Buettner, New York Times Best-selling author, National Geographic Fellow and founder of the 'Blue Zones', who has spent years studying the places and cultures where people live the longest and why.

      <title>An Unlikely Friendship That Helped Shape America</title>
      <description>Decades before the United States desegregated, President Theodore Roosevelt and Booker T. Washington broke the racial barrier in American politics. The pair's professional relationship sparked outrage in Washington, as the country just passed the Jim Crow laws a decade prior. Brian Kilmeade, the host of FOX and Friends and the Brian Kilmeade show, joins the Rundown to discuss his new book, “Teddy and Booker T.: How Two American Icons Blazed a Path for Racial Equality,” and shares why their friendship is something to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.

Thanksgiving is here, which means the winter holidays are just around the corner. Every year around this time, Americans prepare their Christmas shopping lists for loved ones, yet some families struggling financially are not able to give their kids presents for the holiday. Ret. Marine Colonel Ted Silvester is the Vice President of the Marine Toys for Tots Foundation, and he says his organization wants to support every family that seeks holiday help. He joins the podcast to share how Toys for Toys is breaking down barriers to provide families support and letting parents be the heroes.

Plus, commentary from Jim Daly, president of Focus on the Family.

      <title>Evening Edition: Car Explosion At Canadian Border Crossing Raises Thoughts Of A Terror Attack  </title>
      <description>Frayed nerves, a warning by FBI Director Chris Wray of increased terror threat and a war in the Middle East have Americans on edge this holiday season. So, when an explosion happens at an international crossing between the United States and Canada, the possibility of a terror attack are our first thoughts. It happened Wednesday night when a car crashed and exploded at the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, New York.   

FOX’s Gurnal Scott speaks with Bill Daly, security expert and former FBI investigator, about what we know about the incident and what is being done to secure important events and sites during the holidays.

      <title>What’s On The Minds Of Americans This Holiday Season</title>
      <description>Americans' views of crime and safety are changing. A recent Gallup poll revealed 40 percent of Americans fear walking alone at night and 60 percent think the criminal justice system is not tough enough on crime. Despite violent crime decreasing in 2023, the data shows clearly U.S. citizens’ personal safety fears are at a three-decade-high. Director of Policing and Public Safety at the Manhattan Institute, Hannah Meyers, joins the Rundown to break down why Americans are feeling less safe in their own neighborhoods.

As the holidays creep closer, more people are reporting stress and anxiety, for which they point to a variety of sources: family obligations, travel, financial stress, heated political discussions, and more. Is there a way to manage the holiday stress and keep the peace at the Thanksgiving dinner table? Clinical psychologist Dr. Jeff Gardere says it is as easy as setting boundaries and knowing your limits. He joins the podcast to explain how families can avoid conversation landmines and potential family feuds this season.

Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of “Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla.”

      <title>Evening Edition: Inflation Slows But Prices Remain High  </title>
      <description>October's consumer price index was flat and inflation slowed but prices of goods remain high. Besides the high prices at the grocery store, consistently high inflation means interest rates, home loans and financing for a new car will all remain high. While the CPI showed inflation was increasing at a slower rate, how and when will Americans see a decrease in everyday expenses?
FOX’s John Saucier speaks with Peter C. Earle, economist and author of American Institute for Economic Research's "Everyday Price Index", about the state of inflation, how it is impacting Americans and will there be some relief from high prices.

      <title>Can America Avoid Travel Turmoil This Holiday Season?</title>
      <description>Major U.S. airlines are bracing for a record number of flyers during this Thanksgiving travel season, with one report projecting about 29.9 million passengers between November 17th and 27th. Travel issues arise during high-volume periods but many still remember in January 2023 when all planes in America were grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration for the first time since 9/11, stemming from a computer system error. U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg joins the Rundown to discuss why he’s confident in the FAA this year, his faith in the future of electric vehicles and the resilience of America’s travel infrastructure.

President Joe Biden turned 81 years old on Monday, making him the oldest person to serve as commander-in-chief. Voters have expressed concern about President Biden's age, saying he is too old to be an effective leader. In fact, recent polling shows that former President Donald Trump is ahead by two points. Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, joins the Rundown to discuss how Biden’s age will affect his reelection campaign and why Bidenomics isn't resonating with voters.

Plus, commentary by Fox News Contributor and author of “The Magnificent Mischief of Tad Lincoln,” Raymond Arroyo.

      <title>Evening Edition: Libertarian Elected President Of Argentina </title>
      <description>A libertarian outsider and economist, nicknamed 'the Trump of Argentina', Javier Milei, of the Liberty Advances party, gained a decisive victory over an establishment center-left candidate over the weekend in Argentina's presidential election. Milei railed against the country's rampant inflation, high levels of poverty and government corruption to gain wide support. Milei becomes the world's first libertarian head of state. 

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with David Unsworth, foreign correspondent covering Latin America, about the election result's impact to Argentina and the region.

      <title>Steve Scalise Talks House Priorities When Congress Heads Back to Washington</title>
      <description>Though Congress is getting a break to spend Thanksgiving with loved ones, members have a lot of work to do when they return to Washington. House Republicans have their hands full with working across the aisle to reach a consensus on how to fund the government while cutting back spending, securing our southern border, aiding our allies in Ukraine and Israel, and more -- but will the Democratic-led Senate and President Biden be open to working alongside Republicans to avoid the back and forth we've seen thus far? On the Rundown, House Majority Leader Steve Scale (R-LA) discusses why he believes Republicans are on a great path forward under the new leadership of his fellow Louisianan Speaker Mike Johnson and how "unity" will be the tool Republicans need to pass the policies they're confident will better America. He also discusses how he's been doing since his cancer diagnosis earlier this year and why he remains grateful this holiday season.
Inflation has started to cool off, allowing many to purchase more this holiday season. Americans are on pace to spend about 4.5 percent less on Thanksgiving dinner than they did last year, with key ingredients down about 20 percent. Stew Leonard Jr., owner of the Stew Leonard's grocery chain, joins the Rundown to discuss turkey prices and how inflation impacted the supply chain.
Plus, commentary from former U.S. Senator and U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa, Scott Brown.

      <title>Extra: The Economy, Age, And RFK Jr. ... The State Of The 2024 Race</title>
      <description>The crowded Republican presidential field is slowly shrinking ... but so are President Biden's polling numbers.
Senator Tim Scott surprisingly suspended his campaign last week. While he was trailing in the polls, he had solid fundraising and was expected to at least remain through the Iowa caucuses. 
Meanwhile, President Biden, who is trailing former President Trump and the other top GOP hopefuls in national polls, is hearing concerns from his own party about his ability to win a second term.
Earlier this week, the FOX News Rundown's Lisa Brady spoke to both FOX News Contributor and host of The Ben Domenech Podcast Ben Domenech and Democratic Strategist Kevin Walling about the state of the 2024 race.
They both addressed how topics like President Biden's age, President Trump's legal troubles, and the economy were all weighing on the minds of voters.
Both guests also discussed the impact independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could have on the race and which party he'd likely 'steal' votes from.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with both Ben Domenech and Kevin Walling. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear our unedited interviews with both guests and get even more of their take on this 2024 presidential race.

      <itunes:summary>The crowded Republican presidential field is slowly shrinking ... but so are President Biden's polling numbers.
Senator Tim Scott surprisingly suspended his campaign last week. While he was trailing in the polls, he had solid fundraising and was expected to at least remain through the Iowa caucuses. 
Meanwhile, President Biden, who is trailing former President Trump and the other top GOP hopefuls in national polls, is hearing concerns from his own party about his ability to win a second term.
Earlier this week, the FOX News Rundown's Lisa Brady spoke to both FOX News Contributor and host of The Ben Domenech Podcast Ben Domenech and Democratic Strategist Kevin Walling about the state of the 2024 race.
They both addressed how topics like President Biden's age, President Trump's legal troubles, and the economy were all weighing on the minds of voters.
Both guests also discussed the impact independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could have on the race and which party he'd likely 'steal' votes from.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with both Ben Domenech and Kevin Walling. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear our unedited interviews with both guests and get even more of their take on this 2024 presidential race.

      <title>From Washington: Taking Action Against Historic Rise In Antisemitism  </title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/11/19/from-washington-taking-action-against-historic-rise-in-antisemitism/</link>
      <description>In the weeks since Hamas’ deadly terror attack against Israel, anti-Semitic hate crimes have seen a historic rise across college campuses. The Biden Administration has rolled out new initiatives to combat the increase in hate crimes, but is the administration taking the right steps toward curbing attacks against Jewish Americans? President and CEO of Hillel International Adam Lehman shares what he believes the administration needs to do to stamp out antisemitism on college campuses, how the attacks on Israel have brought the issue to the forefront, and highlights the work that his organization does on campuses across the United States. 

During the third Republican presidential primary debate, candidates were asked about the United States' naval capabilities, as well as their approaches to deter China from invading Taiwan. Former Navy Captain and Senior Research Fellow Naval Warfare and Advanced Technologies at the Heritage Foundation Brent Sadler explains the Navy's plans for decommissioning ships and shares why the shrinking number of fleets signals to China that the country is not serious about defending Taiwan. Later, he discusses his takeaways from candidates' positions on the matter at the last debate.

      <title>Extra: A Senator's Plan For The U.S. To Compete With China ... And Win</title>
      <description>President Joe Biden attended the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in San Francisco where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in over a year.
Just before that critical meeting, the FOX News Rundown's Jessica Rosenthal spoke with Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy about America's relationship with China and how he hoped Biden would confront Xi on issues like trade, Taiwan's sovereignty, and that spy balloon incident from earlier this year.
Cassidy emphasized the importance of protecting our nation's intellectual property and shared details about his recent trip to China where he met American businesses who said their company secrets were stolen.
The Louisiana senator also suggested how the U.S can finally stand up to Beijing on the issue of climate and hold them accountable for their pollution
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Senator Bill Cassidy. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more about his trip to China and his ideas on how the U.S. can better compete with them.

      <title>From Washington: A Government Shutdown Avoided...For Now</title>
      <description>Congress averted a government shutdown this week, passing a continuing resolution. The unusual "laddered CR" bill, created by new House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), will fund some departments until January 19th while others will be funded until February 2nd. Meanwhile, the House Ethics Committee issued its report on GOP Representative George Santos (R-NY), accusing him of using campaign funds inappropriately. FOX News Congressional Correspondent Aishah Hasnie shares her reporting on the latest from the halls of Congress.
In his first visit to the United States in six years, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in San Francisco earlier this week. In their hours-long talks, President Joe Biden and President Xi reached several agreements regarding fentanyl trafficking, military communications, and artificial intelligence. Gordon Chang, Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Gatestone Institute and a China expert weighs in on what the agreements mean for the U.S. and explains why maintaining communication with China won't necessarily benefit the country's military.

      <title>Evening Edition: Decades Long Differences Between The U.S And China Remain After APEC Meeting   </title>
      <description>President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met face to face for the first time in a year this week at the APEC summit in California. They spoke for hours and following the meeting the two leaders say they are both willing to cooperate and talk more. Biden and Xi shook hands and smiled for cameras but what real progress, if any, was made to mend a relationship that has been rocky for decades?

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Gordon Chang, China policy expert and author of 'China is Going to War', who says that time will tell what real impact the meeting had and that the United States needs to have a tougher stance against Beijing.

      <title>President Biden’s Balancing Act: War, Foreign Relations, &amp; Lagging 2024 Support</title>
      <description>It was a busy week for President Biden, with important foreign policy meetings amid the war in the Middle East and his 2024 poll numbers showing a significant drop in support. The latest Fox News polls found that former President Trump, along with the other leading candidates for the GOP presidential nomination, are projected to beat President Biden in key battleground states in 2024. FOX News Sunday anchor and host of Living the Bream podcast, Shannon Bream, joins the Rundown to discuss the outcome of Biden’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, how Congress avoided a shutdown, and the President’s lagging poll numbers.

Following their meeting in San Francisco earlier this week, President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to help stop the flow of Chinese-made fentanyl into the United States. Thousands of Americans die every year as a result of fentanyl overdoses, and some claim the deal between the two nations is not nearly enough. Lisa Deane, founder of demandZero, who lost her son to a fentanyl overdose, joins the Rundown to share her family's story.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary by Jason Rantz, Host of the Jason Rantz Show and author of "What’s Killing America."

      <title>Evening Edition: TikTok Users Praising Osama bin Laden's Justification Of 9/11 Attacks  </title>
      <description>TikTok influencer and pro-Palestinian activist has gone viral for promoting Osama bin Laden's "Letter to America." First published in Arabic on the internet after the 9/11 terror attacks, the two page document justified the attack saying the United States' support of Israel was to blame. TikTok users were referencing the letter on a British site before it was taken down by the publication.

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Jake Denton, Research Associate in the Tech Policy Center at The Heritage Foundation, about the viral post and the dangers of TikTok's influence.

      <title>New Terror Warnings Linked To Our Porous Border</title>
      <description>The head of the FBI told Congress the terrorist threat level against the United States has risen higher now as Al-Qaeda and ISIS issued fresh calls to attack Americans in recent weeks. Republicans, who have been heavily critical of the U.S. Southern border security measures, have been quick to link the ineffective border policy to renewed concerns over terrorist threats to homeland security. Former National Security Council Advisor Michael Allen joins the Rundown to discuss the surging terrorist threat level and how a weak southwest border could impact the precarious situation.

This Monday, President Joe Biden turns 81, and recent polling shows that more than half of Americans think he is "too old" for the job. As President Biden continues his re-election campaign, several of his fellow Democrats feel that it's in his best interest not to run. Mark Penn, former advisor to President Bill Clinton and CEO of Stagwell Inc., joins the podcast to break down why many think "Bidenomics" is not working, the current unfavorable opinion of the President, and how a third-party candidate could throw a wrench in the 2024 race.

Plus, commentary from host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Evening Edition: Putin Turning To Anti-Semitism To Strengthen Power </title>
      <description>Vladimir Putin has always boasted about his relationship with the Jewish community and nearly twenty years ago became the first Russian president to travel to Israel. Those sentiments look to be changing as Russia welcomed a Hamas delegation just weeks ago and refused to recognize them as a terrorist group. And in an even more troubling event, an anti-Semitic mob stormed an airport tarmac in southern Russia with the intent to hunt down Jews on an incoming flight from Tel Aviv.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Leon Aron, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and author of the book, 'Riding the Tiger: Vladimir Putin's Russia and the Uses of War', born in Moscow and came to the United States as a refugee in the late seventies, about the concerning rise in Russian anti-Semitic fervor and how Putin is using this politically.

      <title>President Biden &amp; China’s Xi To Meet. What’s At Stake?</title>
      <description>President Biden meets today with China’s President Xi Jinping for the first time in a year. After a tumultuous year of relations with China due to issues like the spy balloons, our fierce economic competition, Chinese hacking resulting in the theft of American intellectual property, and military tensions over Taiwan. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) joins the Rundown to discuss what he believes the U.S. priorities must be in this San Francisco meeting, the balance between competing with China while collaborating with them, and what the ideal U.S. relationship with China should look like.

Inflation is finally cooling off ahead of the 2023 holiday season. For the first time since last July, consumer prices didn't increase, indicating that U.S. spending habits are returning to normal. However, recent reporting shows that more than half of Americans are in credit card debt due to the high cost of living. FOX Business correspondent Gerri Willis joins the podcast to break down the latest CPI numbers, why investors were surprised by the report, and the evidence that suggests consumers are "not in a good place" despite the positive news.

Plus, commentary by columnist David Marcus.

      <title>2024 Polls Spell Trouble, Concern From Democrats</title>
      <description>Senator Tim Scott has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, leaving just a few candidates in the GOP primary that are polling above 5 percent. Meanwhile, troubling poll numbers for the Biden and Trump campaigns came out of a recent Quinnipiac survey that showed RFK Jr. with 22 percent of support in a hypothetical three-way race with the incumbent and former President. First, Fox News contributor and host of ‘The Ben Domenech Podcast,’ Ben Domenech, joins the Rundown to explain how the White House is navigating kitchen table issues and RFK Jr.’s potential role as 2024 spoilers. Later, Democratic strategist and former Biden campaign surrogate Kevin Walling joins to break down how the Biden administration plans to win back angered sections of the Democratic base.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has proposed a new continuing resolution to keep the government funded through the remainder of the year, attempting to narrowly avoid a shutdown as the November 17th deadline approaches. However, his proposed CR is unusual compared to the past, with Speaker Johnson seeking to set two separate deadlines. Senior Vice President and Senior Policy Director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Marc Goldwein, joins the podcast to analyze Speaker Johnson's new plan and describe why neither party is willing to address the root of the problem.

Plus, commentary by former Congressman Jason Chaffetz, host of the Jason in the House podcast.

      <title>Why A Ceasefire Is Off The Table For Israel</title>
      <description>As civilians in Gaza continue to struggle immensely, there are mixed thoughts on whether Israel should call a ceasefire or continue its fight against Hamas. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed last week that a cease fire is not an option as of now as it could benefit Hamas. At home, concerns over the southern border are top of mind -- as calls for better resources and funding remain an insistent ask from Republican lawmakers. On the Rundown, the youngest female to ever serve in the Senate and Alabama's first female Senator, Katie Britt, discusses why she agrees a ceasefire cannot happen until Hamas is defeated and how the White House's inability to acknowledge the border crisis stops them from fixing it. She also discusses her new book, 'God Calls Us To Do Hard Things: Lessons from the Alabama Wiregrass,' which shares her story and urges Americans to better for themselves and the nation.
Since the pandemic normalized working from home, office spaces have been less occupied, with one report even showing office occupancy rates in major cities are nearly half their pre-pandemic levels. The Biden administration has announced it will try to convert commercial real estate to residential housing to help with affordability. Economist and business professor at University of Maryland, Peter Morici tells the Rundown this effort is unrealistic. He joins to break down the threat of a commercial real estate crash, how the burden of the crisis could fall to mid-sized banks, and the biggest obstacles to converting office buildings into residential housing.
Plus, commentary from New York Post columnist and co-author of "The Canceling of the American Mind," Rikki Schlott.

      <title>From Washington: Is There A Pathway To A Two-State Solution?</title>
      <description>As the Israel-Hamas war continues into its second month of combat, Israeli forces have entered Gaza City to target Hamas terrorists. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated that an Israeli security presence may be needed in Gaza indefinitely, however, the Biden Administration advises against it but agrees a new dynamic between the territories must exist. But what does the future of Gaza look like? International Policy Expert and former State Department Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations Frank Lowenstein provides his take on how the United States should move forward with this conflict.

The results from this past Election Day have highlighted the country's divided stance on abortion; Ohioans voted to amend reproductive rights in the state constitution. Many believe the outcome in Ohio is a precursor for what issues will be prominent in the 2024 presidential race, as Democrats see this as a victory. The Director of the FOX News Decision Desk, Arnon Mishkin, joins to break down how abortion will affect candidates heading into 2024 and what the decision means for the Democratic party.

      <title>From Washington: Candidates Compete For Second Place At Third Debate</title>
      <description>On Wednesday night, Republican candidates battled over issues such as foreign policy, abortion, and security during the third Republican presidential debate. Despite the narrowing field, not much has changed in terms of polling as former President Donald Trump maintains his commanding lead. With less than a year until the 2024 presidential election, is it too late for candidates to stand out? National Political Reporter at The Hill Julia Manchester shares her takeaways from the debate and discusses what Tuesday's off-year elections mean for the upcoming year.

There's a new name above the speaker's suite at the Capitol, but House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) is facing the same issues that troubled his predecessor, Congressman Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). This week, House Republicans pulled two appropriations bills from the floor due to a lack of support to pass. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram discusses Speaker Johnson's "laddered" continuing resolution and the challenges he faces to unite his divided party amid a looming government shutdown.

      <title>Evening Edition: Veteran Shares Story Of Recovery And Hope  </title>
      <description>The '988 National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline' was established in July of 2022 and since then nearly six million people have contacted the service. Out of those millions, nearly one-quarter of them were made to the dedicated 'Veterans Crisis Line and Military Crisis Line'. This year has seen a record number of calls into the hotline by a veteran community in which many still feel seeking help shows weakness. 
  
FOX's Eben Brown speaks with retired Marine Edward Schrank, an eight-time head and neck cancer survivor from chemical exposure while serving in the Marines, about his recovery story and his plight to make sure veterans know they are not alone when they need help.

      <title>Israel’s Fight For Survival</title>
      <description>After Israel suffered a surprise attack on October 7th by Hamas terrorists, their country had mere hours to mourn before entering a state of war. Despite Israel's long history of fending off threats from nearby enemies, mandatory military service, and recent political polarization, the people of Israel appear united and resilient in the face of terror and war. Special guest host Dana Perino speaks with Dan Senor, former foreign policy advisor to President Bush and author of the new book, “The Genius of Israel.” Dan recounts where he was when he learned of the October 7th Hamas terror attacks and how his book unpacks how Israeli citizens unite and project resilience in the face of great adversity.

On Tuesday, Ohioans voted "yes" to amend abortion access into the state constitution, giving people in the state the right to make and carry out their own reproductive decisions. This decision marks a significant success for Democrats, who are seeking to add abortion-related measures to ballots in swing states heading into the 2024 election. FOX News Sunday anchor and host of the Living the Bream podcast, Shannon Bream, joins the Rundown to discuss how abortion will affect candidates in the 2024 presidential election and why Congress needs to act on Israel and Ukraine funding before the government runs out of money.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary by author of "The Long March Home," Marcus Brotherton.

      <title>Evening Edition: Focus On Foreign Policy In Third GOP Debate    </title>
      <description>The third Republican debate had a less crowded stage and candidates actually had a chance to explain their policies. There was a major focus on foreign policy and a good mix of finger pointing over who should be blamed for Tuesday's GOP election losses. Trump seemed to be an afterthought but there were moments when he was attacked. 

FOX’s John Saucier speaks with Colin Reed, co-founder South &amp; Hill Strategies and Republican strategist, who shares his thoughts on the third Republican debate, who were the winners and losers and what this week's election results mean for each party.

      <title>The Democrats Divided Over Israel-Hamas War</title>
      <description>Protests are breaking out across the country as a result of the Israel-Hamas war, with many supporting pro-Palestinian causes in major cities. The rhetoric has grown inflammatory both in these demonstrations and on Capitol Hill. Recently, Rep. Rashida Tlaib was censured by the House after promoting false narratives about the Hamas attack on October 7th. As the divide between Democrats widens on this issue, what could this mean moving forward? On the Rundown, Fox &amp; Friends co-host and host of The Brian Kilmeade Show, Brian Kilmeade, joins to discuss why understanding the complex history behind the Israel-Hamas war is crucial before forming opinions and also discusses his new book hitting shelves, 'Teddy and Booker T,' which explores the allyship between Theodore Roosevelt and Booker T. Washington.

When Democrats went to the ballot boxes on Tuesday, abortion was most certainly an issue on their minds. In the now-red state of Ohio, 56 percent of voters approved Measure One to amend the state constitution to preserve Ohioans reproductive health rights, including birth control and abortion. In Virginia, Democrats won full state legislative control, and in Kentucky, incumbent Democratic Governor Andy Bashear held onto his seat. In all of these results, pundits say abortion was a driving factor. GOP pollster and President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter, joins the podcast to explain how this issue drove people to the polls and its potential impact on 2024.

Plus, commentary by former Trump economic adviser and economist at the Heritage Foundation, Steve Moore.

      <title>Why Sen. Cruz Wants To Make America "Unwoke" Again</title>
      <description>In the wake of Hamas’ October 7th terror attacks on Israel, university campus protests were sparked against Israel and in favor of the Palestinian cause. Many of these college demonstrations featuring antisemitic chants or signs have been supported by some university staff, bringing many to question what exactly is being taught in America’s educational institutions. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) believes cultural Marxism is to blame for this, arguing in his new book, "Unwoke,” that much of what is being spread in U.S. institutions is a dangerous far-left ideology. He joins the Rundown to discuss his new book, how it can explain the surge in anti-Israel and antisemitic incidents in higher education, and the misinformation surrounding the effectiveness of socialism.

If someone is charged with domestic violence, is taking firearms away from them responsible or unconstitutional? The Supreme Court will soon decide. A 1994 law that prohibits anyone under a domestic violence restraining order from having a gun is currently being challenged by Zackey Rahimi, a Texas man who pleaded guilty to illegally possessing firearms after his right to own guns was struck down due to his involvement in five shooting instances in 2020 and 2021. On the Rundown, FOX News Contributor and law professor at George Washington University, Jonathan Turley, explains why he believes the Supreme Court took this case on, the current precedence surrounding this issue, and the different factors that make this case complex.

Plus, commentary by New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz.

      <title>It's Election Day... And It Could Have Big Implications For 2024</title>
      <description>Election Day has arrived, and in many states, voters will be addressing ballot initiatives on abortion rights. In Ohio, voters will vote to decide whether or not to include women's right to abortions in the state constitution. In Virginia, Governor Glenn Youngkin says, if reelected, he will pass a 15-week ban on abortion. Co-director of the Fox News Poll and professor at the University of Texas at Austin, Daron Shaw, joins the Rundown to discuss President Joe Biden's recent polling, why the Mississippi governor's race is an indicator of the President's favorability amongst Black communities, and why these races may gauge the significance of abortion heading into the next election.

For years, national security experts and government officials warned how dangerous TikTok could be, especially when it comes to the spread of propaganda and misinformation. Now, amid the Israel-Hamas war, critics are once again calling for a TikTok ban, alleging that the app is pushing anti-Israel content to undercut Americans’ support for the U.S. ally. A former executive for the app Tinder noted that young Americans in high school and college are receiving a great deal of “wrong information” about the war from TikTok. Vice President at Cyabra, Rafi Mendelsohn, works on combating social media disinformation and bot networks. He joins the podcast to explain the disinformation campaign being waged against Israel and what people can do to avoid falling victim to bad information they find on social media.

Plus, commentary by Fox Nation host Tammy Bruce.

      <title>House Republicans May Have A Speaker Now, But Can They Keep Their Majority?</title>
      <description>After House Republicans were able to elect new Speaker Mike Johnson, they're now working to ensure they can not only maintain their majority in the House — but grow it. With many vulnerable Democratic seats that could be for the taking, the priority is now gathering sufficient funds for competitive House races and fixing the issues that are still plaguing Americans across the country. On the Rundown, Republican National Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson (NC-09) explains why he's confident in Speaker Mike Johnson's fundraising capabilities after the House saw their "best fundraising week of the year" under his leadership. He also discusses which seats he believes Republicans could win in 2024 and the problems he's working to fix that weigh heavy on his constituents in North Carolina.
 
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is being sued by nearly all individual states. Different social media companies have been accused of stealing user data to contribute to mental illness among America's youth. Forty-one states and Washington D.C. are accusing Meta of using "manipulative features" and "misleading the public," resulting in children becoming intentionally addicted to social media. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares joins to break down why infinite scrolling is "behavioral cocaine" and explain how social media companies ignore harmful material.
 
Plus, commentary by author and Vice President of Communications for Focus on The Family, Paul Batura.

      <title>Extra: Chris Christie Unedited</title>
      <description>Former President Donald Trump continues to dominate the GOP primary race. And with the media's focus on the Israel-Hamas war, it's been even harder for his opponents to gain traction. 
2024 presidential candidate Chris Christie recently joined the FOX News Rundown's Jessica Rosenthal to discuss why the race is far from over, and why he believes his candidacy still has a path towards winning the Republican nomination. 
The former New Jersey governor also weighed in on the Biden administration's handling of the Mideast conflict and how he'd handle the crisis if he was the Commander-in-Chief.
We made edits for time and thought it was important for you to hear our entire conversation with Gov. Christie. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear the full interview and learn more about his take on the GOP race, the war between Israel and Hamas, and some key domestic issues like education.

      <title>From Washington: Busy Week At The White House As War Rages In Israel &amp; Border Concerns Grow </title>
      <description>It was another busy week for the Biden Administration, as Israel’s war against Hamas continues, with Israeli forces pushing deeper into Gaza. FOX News Political Anchor and Washington Correspondent Jared Halpern discusses the Biden Administration’s messaging on the war and its efforts to send aid into the Gaza Strip. Jared also touches upon renewed concerns by mayors across the United States about the ongoing crisis at the Southern Border, and the President’s trip to Lewiston, Maine to meet with survivors of the recent mass shooting in the state. 
 
Tuesday is Election Day, and the Kentucky gubernatorial race remains close, as incumbent Governor Andy Beshear and Attorney General Daniel Cameron are polling at 47%, according to Emerson College Polling. While the Bluegrass state may decide to keep its Democratic Governor, Virginia Democrats are using Governor Glenn Youngkin's proposed 15-week abortion ban to urge voters to reject GOP votes in the State House and Senate races. The Senate and Governors Editor for the Cook Political Report, Jessica Taylor, explains why Governor Beshear remains popular and why the issue of abortion highlights bigger issues heading into 2024.

      <title>Extra: "Beyond The Pale" ... Rep. Van Order On The Horrors He Saw Visiting Israel</title>
      <description>Shortly after Hamas' brutal October 7th attack, Congressman Derrick Van Orden traveled to Israel and visited some of the sites where terrorists massacred innocent civilians.
Van Orden, who is a retired Navy Seal and combat medic, was shocked by the massacre's bloody aftermath and the firsthand accounts he heard.
This past week, the Wisconsin Republican joined host Dave Anthony to share what he saw in Israel and explain why it's important for the world to know how horrific the Hamas attack was.
In the long and graphic discussion, Van Orden also explained why he is adamant about getting aid to Israel and angry as those backing the Palestinians. In fact, he told Dave why he even opposes sending humanitarian aid to Gaza.
We made edits for time and thought it was important for you to hear our entire conversation with Rep. Derrick Van Orden. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear the full interview and learn more about the graphic things he witnessed and what America should be doing to support Israel's effort to crush Hamas.

      <title>From Washington: Could A Humanitarian Pause Complicate The War?</title>
      <description>On Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for a humanitarian pause in the fighting in Gaza in an attempt to facilitate the release of hostages held by Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu rejected the Secretary's attempt at diplomacy and said he could not agree to a ceasefire without the release of hostages by the terrorist organization. Retired 4-star General, Chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, and FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane explains how the administration's push for a pause only further complicates the war. Later, he reacts to the proxy attacks on U.S. facilities and troops within the region and discusses what to expect in terms of a widening conflict.

Congressman Mike Johnson (R-LA) just finished his first full week as House Speaker, already setting up spending arguments with the Senate, and even hosting a news conference with Capitol Hill Press, answering questions about his plans to avoid a government shutdown and requesting emergency funding requests from the Administration. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram shares his reporting on Speaker Johnson's approach to keep Congress in line, and how he plans to keep the job.

      <title>Shannon Bream On “The Axis Of Evil” And War Across the Globe</title>
      <description>The Rafah border in Egypt has opened for the first time since the war in Israel began, giving hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza the ability to return home. The State Department says an undisclosed number of U.S. citizens have already left Gaza, with the Biden administration working nonstop to make sure everyone is able to return to the United States safely. FOX News Sunday anchor and host of Living the Bream podcast, Shannon Bream, joins the Rundown to share what factors are making it difficult for foreigners to escape, why President Biden is having a hard time campaigning during the war in the Middle East, and break down the latest FOX News Power Rankings.

Economists fearing an approaching recession were given some good news: U.S. gross domestic product grew at 4.9 percent due in large part to a surge in consumer spending. But with interest rates expected to rise and war in the Middle East, America’s economic future is uncertain. Kaltbaum Capital Management President and FOX Business contributor Gary Kaltbaum joins the Rundown to break down why the good news about the GDP may be short-lived if federal spending gets out of control. Later, he analyzes a steep drop in the U.S. birth rate and the dangerous implications it has for the future of the nation’s economy. 

Plus, commentary by the author of "Dear William: A Father’s Memoir of Addiction, Recovery, Love, and Loss,” David McGee.

      <title>Evening Edition: Republicans Calling For The Revoking Of Visas Of Hamas Sympathizers  </title>
      <description>Following the Hamas terror attacks on Israel and in a wave of antisemitic protests across the country, Republicans are calling on the State Department to revoke student visas of those who openly support Hamas. Critics say this idea would infringe of the right of free speech. Hamas has been labeled a terror organization by the United States for more than twenty five years.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Griff Jenkins, Washington D.C.-based reporter for the FOX News channel, about this push to revoke student visas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken's latest trip to the Mideast.

      <title>Is Pressure Growing For 2024 GOP Candidates To Drop Out?</title>
      <description>The Iowa caucus is approaching, and candidates have a few short months to persuade voters who will soon cast their ballots. The latest FOX News Power Rankings show that former President Donald Trump remains the GOP frontrunner despite his mounting legal troubles. In key states like Arizona and North Carolina, Trump is polling ahead of incumbent President Joe Biden. Fox News politics co-anchor, anchor of The Story, and host of The Untold Story Podcast, Marth MacCallum, joins the Rundown to discuss where the candidates stand ahead of the third Republican debate next week and why there is growing pressure on some candidates to consider dropping out.

FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that anti-semitism in America was reaching “historic” levels, noting that the Jewish population accounted for only 2.4 percent of the U.S. but faced nearly 60 percent of all religious-based hate crimes. In response to the Israel-Hamas war, there has been a surge in anti-semitism, especially on college campuses where some pro-Palestinian rhetoric has descended into hatred towards all Jews. Cornell University is one such campus, where prominent instances of anti-semitism and threats towards Jewish students have grabbed headlines. Simone, a Jewish student at Cornell University, joins to give her perspective on the anti-semitism on college campuses across the country and her hope for better education when it comes to the war and hate speech toward Jews.

Plus, commentary by columnist David Marcus.

        <![CDATA[<p>The Iowa caucus is approaching, and candidates have a few short months to persuade voters who will soon cast their ballots. The latest FOX News Power Rankings show that former President Donald Trump remains the GOP frontrunner despite his mounting legal troubles. In key states like Arizona and North Carolina, Trump is polling ahead of incumbent President Joe Biden. Fox News politics co-anchor, anchor of The Story, and host of The Untold Story Podcast, Marth MacCallum, joins the Rundown to discuss where the candidates stand ahead of the third Republican debate next week and why there is growing pressure on some candidates to consider dropping out.</p><p><br></p><p>FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that anti-semitism in America was reaching “historic” levels, noting that the Jewish population accounted for only 2.4 percent of the U.S. but faced nearly 60 percent of all religious-based hate crimes. In response to the Israel-Hamas war, there has been a surge in anti-semitism, especially on college campuses where some pro-Palestinian rhetoric has descended into hatred towards all Jews. Cornell University is one such campus, where prominent instances of anti-semitism and threats towards Jewish students have grabbed headlines.

      <title>Evening Edition: FBI Director Warns Of An Increased Terror Threat</title>
      <description>FBI Director Christopher Wray, appearing before a Senate committee yesterday, warned that the possibility terror attack on the United States "has elevated." The director said that law enforcement agents are scouring social media sites and other probes looking for any connection between the Hamas terror group and anyone living in the United States. It also increases concerns that foreign terrorist fighters that are a part of the Israel-Hamas conflict could be trying to get across the southern border.

FOX's John Saucier speaks with David Spunt, FOX News' Washington D.C. based correspondent, about the hearing and FBI Director Wray's warnings.

      <title>Clash Within Congress Over Israel Aid Package</title>
      <description>Top U.S. defense officials are urging Congress to quickly approve military aid for both Israel and Ukraine, as Netanyahu moves forward with the IDF’s ground invasion of Gaza. This week, however, many House Republicans plan to vote on a nearly $14 billion stand-alone aid package for Israel, voicing concerns that the money being sent to Ukraine isn't being used in the way it was intended. Wisconsin Congressman Derrick Van Orden (R-WI) recently visited the destruction in Israel and described what he saw on the Rundown while also sharing why Congress needs to focus its funding on Israel and not Ukraine.

The 2024 GOP candidates are grappling with a shift of focus towards their foreign policy plans in the Middle East as the conflict there begins to shape the campaign trail. 2024 presidential hopeful and former New Jersey Governor Christie joins the podcast to explain why he believes his candidacy still has a path towards winning the Republican nomination, what the polling tells his team about their anti-Trump campaign rhetoric, and how he expects foreign policy to be a major factor in the race and coming GOP debate.

Plus, commentary from host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Evening Edition: Cornell Professor Not Surprised By Investigation Into Anti-Semitic Threats   </title>
      <description>Cornell University and the FBI are investigating a series of website posts that were threatening violence against the Jewish community of the New York school. One of the threats called for people to follow a Jewish person home and "slit their throats." The threats come days after a Cornell University associated professor of history, speaking at a rally, said he was "exhilarated" and "energized" by the Hamas terror attacks on Israel. 

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with William Jacobson, Clinical Law professor at Cornell University and founder of the 'Legal Insurrection' blog, about the possibility of violence against Jewish students on campus.

      <title>The Growing Fear Of A Widening War In The Middle East</title>
      <description>Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to meet with Saudi Arabia's foreign minister to address growing concerns that the brutal conflict in Israel could spread across the Middle East. The U.S. has been prioritizing efforts to ensure Iran stands down — carrying out two 'self-defense' air strikes in response to several attacks on U.S. bases and personnel carried out by Iran-backed militia groups in recent weeks. On the Rundown, former U.S. National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley shares his response to how the Biden administration is working to avoid escalation in Israel, Hamas' ability to launch a surprise attack without intelligence agencies' knowledge, and his disappointment regarding the 'unacceptable' antisemitic movements that have sparked across the globe following the crisis in Israel, including here in the U.S.

Last Wednesday, 40-year-old Robert Card shot and killed 18 people in Lewiston, Maine. A few months earlier, he had allegedly made threats to an army base and spent two weeks in an inpatient facility. The tragedy has sparked a conversation about whether or not the shooting could have been prevented. Dozens of states across the country have red flag laws that prevent individuals who show signs of being a threat to themselves or others from owning a firearm. Maine has a similar law, but law enforcement must be notified of the threat before putting the individual in protective custody. Former FBI investigator and international security expert Bill Daly joins the podcast to break down the differences between the two laws and discuss what may have slipped through the cracks.

Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of “Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla.”

      <title>Evening Edition: Antisemitism Spreading On College Campuses</title>
      <description>The Anti-Defamation League has recorded an estimated 400 percent increase in antisemitic incidents since the Hamas massacre of Israeli civilians on October 7th. Antisemitic rhetoric has become so rampant on college campuses, particularly. The Biden administration has released a federal plan to fight rising antisemitism on university campuses.
FOX's Eben Brown spoke to Tulane's Hillel Executive Director Ron Gubitz on the podcast, discussing the frightening antisemitic incidents being witnessed on Tulane's campus, what campuses must do to counteract the hate being spread because of the Israel-Hamas war, and his conversations with Jewish students who fear the university cannot protect them from antisemitic hate or violence.

      <title>Rep. Mace Talks Support for New House Speaker, Aid to Israel, and House Priorities</title>
      <description>Now that balance is restored in Congress following Congressman Mike Johnson becoming the House's new Speaker, House Republicans are ready to tackle their high-stakes agenda. As they work to find common ground on how to aid Israel and Ukraine, establishing funding bills to avoid a government shutdown on November 17th, securing the southern border, and more -- the question is -- will Congressman Johnson prove to be the unifying force the GOP needs to come together, work across the aisle, and get the job done? On the Rundown, South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace explains why she decided to support Rep. Johnson for speaker after being one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy and why she's confident he'll be a "tremendous leader." She also explains why the U.S. must work to strengthen our stance on the world stage as brutal wars in Israel and Ukraine rage on and what her priorities are as Congress comes back into session.
 
About 240,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, and oncologists are recommending that screening for the disease begin earlier. As women age, the risks associated with breast cancer increase. However, advanced technology and early detection have allowed patients to live longer post-diagnosis. FOX News Contributor and board-certified radiologist Dr. Nicole Saphier reins breast cancer awareness month by sharing what symptoms both women and men should look for, explaining why early detection is significant, and discussing the benefits artificial intelligence poses to diagnosing patients.
 
Plus, commentary by former White House speechwriter and Fox News Contributor Marc Thiessen.

As women age, the risks associated with breast cancer increase. However, advanced technology and early detection have allowed patients to live longer post-diagnosis. FOX News Contributor and board-certified radiologist Dr. Nicole Saphier reins breast cancer awareness month by sharing what symptoms both women and men should look for, explaining why early detection is significant, and discussing the benefits artificial intelligence poses to diagnosing patients.

        <![CDATA[<p>Now that balance is restored in Congress following Congressman Mike Johnson becoming the House's new Speaker, House Republicans are ready to tackle their high-stakes agenda. As they work to find common ground on how to aid Israel and Ukraine, establishing funding bills to avoid a government shutdown on November 17th, securing the southern border, and more -- the question is -- will Congressman Johnson prove to be the unifying force the GOP needs to come together, work across the aisle, and get the job done? On the Rundown, South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace explains why she decided to support Rep. Johnson for speaker after being one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy and why she's confident he'll be a "tremendous leader." She also explains why the U.S. must work to strengthen our stance on the world stage as brutal wars in Israel and Ukraine rage on and what her priorities are as Congress comes back into session.</p><p> </p><p>About 240,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, and oncologists are recommending that screening for the disease begin earlier.

      <title>Extra: The High-Stakes Race To Weaponize Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <description>Militaries are finding more new ways to use artificial intelligence on and off the battlefield. In fact, there is an international race for countries to keep up with the rapidly advancing technology and maintain an edge over their enemies. 
Senior Fellow and Director at the Center for Defense Concepts and Technology Bryan Clark recently spoke with the Rundown's Chris Foster about the capabilities of AI and how it's already being used by the US military in combat and to collect intelligence.  
He also discussed the risks of AI weaponization and whether computers could ever turn against humans, like in the sci-fi film "The Terminator." 
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Bryan Clark. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear our full conversation with the Navy vet and military expert about how AI is changing warfare and why it is so important for the US to be a leader in the technology.

      <title>From Washington: Terror At The Southern Border</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/10/29/from-washington-terror-at-the-southern-border/</link>
      <description>National security remains a hot topic, with heightened fears that terrorists are entering the United States through the southern border. In fiscal year 2023, over 150 non-U.S. citizens on the terrorist watchlist were encountered at the southern border. U.S. border patrol agents have found it increasingly difficult to vet every individual entering the country. Former Acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf shares why he refers to the crisis as an invasion and why the Biden administration needs to be held accountable for the vast number of migrants entering the nation every day.  
President Joe Biden is breaking centuries' tradition by not filing for the New Hampshire Democratic primary. The decision came Tuesday with the president citing the Democratic National Committee's pledge to discipline candidates who compete in unsanctioned primaries, such as the one in the Granite State. The DNC approved a new calendar proposed by President Biden earlier this year that moves South Carolina's primary to February, seeking to bump New Hampshire from its first-in-the-nation status. FOX's New Hampshire-based national political reporter, Paul Steinhauser, explains the president's decision and discusses Congressman Dean Phillips's (D-MN) presidential campaign announcement.

      <description>On October 7th, 28-year-old New Yorker Natalie Sanandaji was in Israel and attended the Nova Festival with friends.

She also explained why she still feels unsafe even after returning home to America see anti-Semitic incidents and social media posts.

      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/10/28/from-washington-meet-the-new-speaker-of-the-house/</link>
      <description>After three weeks of voting and division among Congressional Republicans during a contentious speakership race, Congressman Mike Johnson (R-LA) was elected as the 56th Speaker of the House. With President Biden aiming to pass a $105 billion funding package, and a looming government shutdown deadline, how will Speaker Johnson prove he's up to the task? FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram explains how Congressman Johnson secured the Speakership and what his voting record could tell us about his newfound leadership.
Virginia Republicans hope to secure legislative control of the state's legislature in the upcoming election. As it stands, Republicans currently hold the power in the state's House, while Democrats control the state Senate. Although Virginia has shifted Red in recent years, Democrats are hoping to rally support by focusing on issues such as Governor Glenn Youngkin's proposed abortion ban. Managing Editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics Kyle Kondik shares what he's watching out for in the race to control the state government. Later, he explains how Virginia's election can inform results in 2024.

      <title>Evening Edition: The Horrors Israeli First Responders Saw Following Hamas Attack   </title>
      <description>The first witnesses to the October 7th Hamas terror attacks were EMTs responding to calls of help. One such EMT group is 'United Hatzalah', made up of Israeli volunteers trained for mass casualty events. The terror attack has stories of both victims and heroes, and both are equally horrifying.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Raphael Poch, Volunteer EMT and Media Spokesperson for United Hatzalah, who has seen the atrocities of the terror attack firsthand.

      <title>What Would A Post-Hamas Gaza Look Like?</title>
      <description>Israeli ground forces conducted a small-scale raid in northern Gaza, where the IDF says they prioritized taking out Hamas fighters and anti-tank weaponry to “prepare the battlefield” ahead of their planned larger ground siege. As Israel retaliates against Hamas’ October 7th terror attacks, the Biden administration has advocated for a humanitarian pause in the fighting in an attempt to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza. President of Eurasia Group, Ian Bremmer, joined the Rundown to discuss why he believes Israel’s desire to invade Gaza is legitimate but foresees a negative impact on Israel’s national security. He goes on to explain the distance from a two-state solution, the feasibility of eliminating Hamas, and the social media mirage promoting hateful division during this conflict.

After nearly three weeks without a speaker, the House elected Congressman Mike Johnson (R-LA) on Wednesday. House Republicans are optimistic despite critics questioning the new Speaker's lackluster credentials. Several of his colleagues dropped out of the race before Speaker Johnson finally tossed his name into the ring, sparking rumors that GOP members were fed up with the process. FOX News Sunday Anchor and host of the Living the Bream podcast, Shannon Bream, discusses what the new Speaker has in store as the House works to pass 12 appropriations bills and later breaks down why former President Donald Trump's co-defendants are seeking plea deals in the 2020 election case.

Plus, commentary by former FBI Special Agent Nicole Parker.

President of Eurasia Group, Ian Bremmer, joined the Rundown to discuss why he believes Israel’s desire to invade Gaza is legitimate but foresees a negative impact on Israel’s national security. He goes on to explain the distance from a two-state solution, the feasibility of eliminating Hamas, and the social media mirage promoting hateful division during this conflict.

After nearly three weeks without a speaker, the House elected Congressman Mike Johnson (R-LA) on Wednesday. House Republicans are optimistic despite critics questioning the new Speaker's lackluster credentials. Several of his colleagues dropped out of the race before Speaker Johnson finally tossed his name into the ring, sparking rumors that GOP members were fed up with the process. FOX News Sunday Anchor and host of the Living the Bream podcast, Shannon Bream, discusses what the new Speaker has in store as the House works to pass 12 appropriations bills and later breaks down why former President Donald Trump's co-defendants are seeking plea deals in the 2020 election case.

Plus, commentary by former FBI Special Agent Nicole Parker.

      <title>Evening Edition: Maine Manhunt Of Mass Shooter Still Underway    </title>
      <description>A massive manhunt continues in Maine as law enforcement hunts down a suspect in a shooting that killed eighteen and wounded more than a dozen more. Authorities say they are looking for a forty-year-old Army Reservist who they say should not be approached as he is considered to be armed and dangerous. A college near where the shootings at a bar and bowling alley took place remains on lockdown and residents are being urged to shelter in place.

FOX's John Saucier speaks with Paul Mauro, attorney and retired NYPD inspector, who says an escape looks to have been planned and law enforcement may have to ready for a long search.

      <title>The House Has A New Speaker. Now The Hard Work Begins</title>
      <description>Congressman Mike Johnson (R-LA) was elected Speaker of the House on Wednesday. After 22 days, which included multiple votes, both publicly on the House floor and privately among the Republican conference, the House GOP coalesced around the four-term representative. Republican strategist and co-founder of South &amp; Hill Strategies, Colin Reed, joins the Rundown to discuss how the last three weeks of the GOP’s speaker election chaos in Congress have impacted the party’s long-term prospects. He explains Speaker Johnson’s difficult task of leading a divided caucus, how support for Israel became a unifying bipartisan cause within Congress, and what tactics House Republicans are likely to use to regain the trust and confidence of 2024 voters on the horizon.

Last month, four Iranians were apprehended at the southern border amid a surge of illegal migrant crossings. Lawmakers are growing concerned about the possibility of terrorists entering the U.S. through the country's open border. Over 150 non-U.S. citizens on the terrorist watchlist were encountered at the border in fiscal year 2023. Kansas Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) joins the Rundown to discuss why he introduced legislation to declare an invasion at the southern border, why he wants expedited asylum, and why he thinks Ukraine and Israel funding should be separate.

Plus, commentary from New York Post columnist and co-author of "The Canceling of the American Mind," Rikki Schlott.

      <title>America’s Growing Mistrust In Media</title>
      <description>Disinformation on social media has surged since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, with verified claims from American journalists being considered suspicious or denied altogether. This trend is in line with Americans’ plummeting trust in the media, which has reached a historic low according to a recent Gallup poll. Howard Kurtz, host of Media Buzz on the FOX News Channel and the Media Buzz Meter podcast, joins the Rundown to discuss how many media organizations failed to fact-check on the Gaza hospital explosion story, the impact hate has on the misinformation being spread, and why the media is partially to blame for rising distrust in news institutions.

New reports indicate that North Korea allegedly provided weapons used during the Hamas attacks in Israel on October 7th. However, it remains unclear how and when the terrorists acquired them. Former CIA Deputy Division Chief for Korea and Senior Research Fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, Bruce Klingner, tells the Rundown that the weapons could date back decades and that Russia may be receiving technology from them too.

Plus, commentary from host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Evening Edition: Israel's Ambassador To The United Nations Demands Secretary-General Resign</title>
      <description>The Israeli ambassador to the United Nations is blasting the Secretary-General and calling for his resignation following his comments at a meeting of the Security Council Tuesday. While Secretary-General recognizes the terror attack by Hamas as 'horrifying' he also said, "It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum." Ambassador Erdan's call for the secretary-general to resign is the first time an Israeli Ambassador has called for the ouster of a sitting U.N. secretary-general.

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Victoria Coates, former deputy national security advisor to President Donald Trump and now with the Heritage Foundation, about the Security Council's meeting and the terror crimes of Hamas.

      <title>Survivor Of Israeli Festival Attack Returns To US, Still Feeling Unsafe</title>
      <description>On October 7th, American citizen Natalie Sanandaji was in Israel attending the Tribe of Nova music festival with her friends. When the dancing and celebrating were interrupted by the explosion of rockets and the ringing of gunfire, Natalie ran for her life for hours to avoid death or capture at the deadly Hamas massacre. On the Rundown, Natalie joins to tell her harrowing account of the terror attack on the music festival in Israel that nearly took her life. After returning to America, she explains the rising fears in the Jewish community after witnessing nationwide attempts at pro-Palestinian protests to deny the reality of Hamas' atrocities or justify the murder of innocent Israelis.
Over the weekend, the SAG-AFTRA strike surpassed the 100-day mark, making this the longest strike in the union's history. Negotiations to end the strike will restart on Tuesday. Talks paused two weeks ago after the studios and actors remained torn over streaming revenue and the use of artificial intelligence. Joe Flint, media and entertainment reporter for The Wall Street Journal, joins the Rundown to explain why small actors are upset with the current state of residuals, why he thinks A-list stars providing solutions will ultimately not help the cause, and share why the average consumer won't see the strike affect content for months down the road.
Plus, commentary from FOX News Contributor Joe Concha.

When the dancing and celebrating were interrupted by the explosion of rockets and the ringing of gunfire, Natalie ran for her life for hours to avoid death or capture at the deadly Hamas massacre. On the Rundown, Natalie joins to tell her harrowing account of the terror attack on the music festival in Israel that nearly took her life.

      <title>Evening Edition: Iran-Backed Militias Launching Attacks On U.S.-Bases </title>
      <description>An Iranian-backed militia has claimed responsibility for a drone attack on an American military base near the border of Jordan and Iraq. There has been an uptick on attacks on U.S. bases in the Mideast since the terror attack on Israel by Hamas. The U.S.S. Carney shot down fifteen drones and at least four cruise missiles in the past week as fears of a wider war intensifies.  

FOX's Alex Hogan speaks with Dr. Rebecca Grant, defense expert and President of IRIS Independent Research, who says we know who the bad actors are and their involvement in trying to make the Mideast conflict worse.

      <title>Need For House Speaker Intensifies As Crises Worsen Overseas</title>
      <description>The first wave of humanitarian aid entered Gaza this weekend amid the humanitarian crisis building during Israel’s war with Hamas. President Biden is now seeking a $105 billion national security package to support Israel, Ukraine, the US-Mexico border, and Taiwan. However, as the House enters its third week without a speaker, all funding decisions remain at a halt. On the Rundown, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner (R-OH) joins the Rundown to discuss how the U.S. must continue working to rescue hostages while providing military aid to Israel and Gaza. He also explains why he’s hopeful a House speaker will be chosen by the end of this week — despite multiple House Republicans now vying for the spot.
 
FBI Director Christopher Wray warns that artificial intelligence can become highly dangerous in the hands of our enemies. Besides being used by bad actors as a tool to push propaganda online, A.I. is also currently being used in militaries across the globe. There is now an international race for countries to keep up with the rapidly advancing technology. Senior Fellow and Director at the Center for Defense Concepts and Technology, Bryan Clark, joins the Rundown to explain how A.I. is dangerous when used for propaganda, how it can be weaponized on the battlefield, and the benefits it has in freeing up manpower.
 
Plus, commentary by a former investment banker and author of ‘You Will Own Nothing,’ Carol Roth.

      <title>Extra: How Did Hamas Catch Israel Intelligence Off Guard?</title>
      <description>Israel is warning that their effort to 'crush' Hamas will be 'lengthy' and 'lethal'.
With their enemy hiding in the crowded streets and complex network of tunnels of Gaza, entering the city and eliminating the terrorists behind October 7th's brutal attack on their country will be a serious challenge.
FOX News Contributor and retired CIA Clandestine Services officer Dan Hoffman recently joined host Dave Anthony to discuss those very challenges and why he believes this war will be very bloody.
Hoffman described the dangers of urban warfare and fighting an enemy who is willing to use civilians as human shields.
The former CIA officer was also blunt about why he was pessimistic about the fate of many of the hostage takes by Hamas.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Dan Hoffman. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more of his expertise and why he thinks there were significant intelligence failures leading up to the deadly attacks on Israel earlier this month.

      <title>From Washington: President Biden Reaffirms Support For Israel &amp; Ukraine</title>
      <description>Thursday night, President Biden gave a rare Oval Office address to reaffirm his commitment to Ukraine and Israel and why both nations needed billions in more funding. FOX News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar joins to discuss the impact of President Biden’s address, whether his trip to Israel was successful, and the chances of Congress passing further aid packages for both nations. 
With just over a year left until the 2024 Presidential Election, former President Trump continues to maintain a strong advantage in both polling and fundraising, according to third quarter campaign finance disclosures. Despite his legal problems, Trump continues to rake in far more campaign cash than his GOP rivals. FOX News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar breaks down the significance of the latest fundraising numbers and which candidates are gaining … or losing momentum.

      <title>Extra: Terror Threats On The Rise. Is The U.S. Ready?</title>
      <description>The war between Israel and Hamas has the world on edge and has put the issue of national security back on the forefront here in America.
Last week, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the United States must prepare for the possibility of foreign terrorist organizations calling on their supporters to conduct attacks on U.S. soil.
Former Special Assistant for National Security to President George W. Bush, Michael Allen joined host Dave Anthony earlier this week to discuss the threat of terrorism and what both the federal and local governments must do to remain vigilant.
Michael Allen, who worked in the Bush Administration in the years following 9/11, also weighed in on the challenges Israel and its allies will face combatting Hamas.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Michael Allen. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more of his perspective on the current global crisis and the renewed fears of terrorism.

      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/10/21/from-washington-house-speaker-stalemate-continues/</link>
      <description>The U.S. House of Representatives has been without a Speaker for over two weeks since the ousting of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). Republican members remain divided over who should fill the vacant speaker’s chair, and will now wait until next week before they take another vote. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram discusses what happened behind the scenes this past week, why Rep. Jim Jordan’s (R-OH) bid wound up failing, and what Republicans may throw their names in the hat next. 
 
Hamas’ brutal terrorist attack on Israel on October 7th has brought the threats posed by Iran and its proxies to the forefront. As the U.S. fears the nation will try to expand the war between Israel and Hamas even further, there is also a growing concern about U.S. national security and protecting our homeland. Former Ambassador at Large and Coordinator for Counterterrorism, Nathan Sales, to discuss why Iran is a "complete concrete threat" and how Iran and terrorist groups could be taking advantage of America’s porous southern border.

Republican members remain divided over who should fill the vacant speaker’s chair, and will now wait until next week before they take another vote. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram discusses what happened behind the scenes this past week, why Rep.

Hamas’ brutal terrorist attack on Israel on October 7th has brought the threats posed by Iran and its proxies to the forefront. As the U.S. fears the nation will try to expand the war between Israel and Hamas even further, there is also a growing concern about U.S. national security and protecting our homeland. Former Ambassador at Large and Coordinator for Counterterrorism, Nathan Sales, to discuss why Iran is a "complete concrete threat" and how Iran and terrorist groups could be taking advantage of America’s porous southern border.

      <title>U.S. Stands Strongly With Israel, While Some College Campuses Still Don’t</title>
      <description>U.S. State Department officials issued a worldwide alert for Americans overseas, as they anticipate America’s outspoken support for Israel to have potential consequences. After his trip to Tel Aviv and national primetime address, President Biden and his administration demonstrated a strong commitment to our ally Israel during their war against the Hamas terrorists. On the Rundown, FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to explain how the administration is preparing for the possibility of this conflict escalating and the united front Congress has presented in supporting Israel. Later, she explains a well-anticipated fight on Capitol Hill over Ukraine and Israel funding.

Pro-Palestinian protests have begun spreading at elite universities across the United States. While these demonstrations on college campuses are not new, some lawmakers are calling for some institutions to lose their tax-exempt status in response to their students’ fiery rhetoric. FOX Business Correspondent Lydia Hu joins the Rundown to discuss why donors are starting to pull their funding from schools, how this change of status would impact a college, and the role institutions should play in educating their students about the conflict in the Middle East.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of "Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla."

      <title>What Does Victory For Israel Look Like?</title>
      <description>President Biden’s trip to Israel on Wednesday was upended following a deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza City. In spite of canceled meetings with the Palestinian Authority leader and King of Jordan, Biden appeared in Tel Aviv and pledged American support to the nation of Israel as they fight their war on the terror group Hamas. FOX News Contributor and retired CIA Clandestine Services officer Dan Hoffman joins the Rundown to discuss why he doesn't think the United States will send troops to the Middle East and what it would take for Israel to succeed if they launch a ground invasion in Gaza to root out Hamas.


Iran remains a major concern for U.S. officials following Israel’s escalating conflict with the terror group Hamas in Gaza. Tehran has long been known as one of the largest state sponsors of terrorism in the world, and their leadership has warned they have plans to carry out preemptive action against Israel. Biden administration officials have announced new sanctions against both Hamas and Iran, but will this be effective in preventing the war from escalating? Former U.S. State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus joins the Rundown to explain how a UN embargo policy lapsing became a major national security threat, her belief that the White House’s Iran policy is failing, why sanctions won’t work a “silver bullet,” and the troubling pattern of U.S. adversaries avoiding the consequences of sanctions.


Plus, commentary by Jason Rantz, Host of the Jason Rantz Show and author of "What’s Killing America."

      <title>Evening Edition: What Is Iran's Role In The Israel-Hamas Conflict?</title>
      <description>President Biden made brief remarks following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today saying the IDF was not to blame for the explosion at a hospital in Gaza. The President also warned Iran, despite strong ties to Hamas, to stay out of the conflict. Tehran's amount of involvement in the terror attack by Hamas is still being discussed but their long history with the militant group and the Muslim Brotherhood cannot be denied.    

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Rich Goldberg, a senior advisor at Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and former Director for Countering Iranian Weapons of Mass Destruction for the White House National Security Council, about the influence Iran has over Hamas and what was their role in the terror attack.

      <title>Domestic and Global Strife Tests U.S. Economy</title>
      <description>Amid economic stressors like an auto worker strike, inflation, and a concerning rise in the US bond yield, Treasury Secretary Yellen says the U.S. can afford to support both Israel and Ukraine. Meanwhile, a recent study found over half of millennials don't interact with the stock market--Charles Payne has written a new book, "Unbreakable Investor," about how simple it is for people to get their start in investing. Host of Fox Business' Making Money and The Unstoppable Prosperity podcast, Charles Payne, joins the Rundown to discuss the latest problems facing the American economy and concerns about the United States' ability to contribute military aid in two separate wars amid economic troubles at home.

President Joe Biden travels to Israel Tuesday to show U.S. support for its ally as they inch closer to almost two weeks of fighting the terror group Hamas. Many have begun to speculate whether or not Iran was involved in the attack, as Iranian leadership threatens a preemptive strike against Israel if they do not stop bombing Gaza soon. North Dakota Governor and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Doug Burgum joins the podcast to explain why he was against the Biden administration unfreezing $6 billion for Iran, why he thinks switching to electric vehicles would negatively impact national security, and his strategy to qualify for the third debate in Miami next month.

Plus, commentary by Fox News Channel senior field reporter Yonat Frilling.

Plus, commentary by Fox News Channel senior field reporter Yonat Frilling.

      <title>Terrorism Abroad Sparks Fresh Concerns For Americans</title>
      <description>Over a week has passed since Hamas unleashed its deadly attacks on Israel, and many Americans are now worried the terrorism abroad could soon impact the U.S. as well. FBI Director Christopher Wray stated over the weekend that the United States must prepare for the possibility of foreign terrorist organizations calling on their supporters to conduct attacks on U.S. soil. However, former Special Assistant for National Security to President George W. Bush, Michael Allen, tells the Rundown that he isn't "overly concerned" about the threat and explains Hamas’ goal to incite violence across the globe.

Republicans are still trying to elect a new speaker of the House, but the task is proving difficult. After internal discussions found that Congressman Steve Scalise did not have enough support to be elected speaker, new focus has been placed on gathering support to name Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio as the new speaker. Choosing a speaker in a timely fashion will become crucial because without a speaker, Congress cannot properly act on supporting Israel or domestic policy goals. Congressman Bob Good (R-VA) helped oust Speaker McCarthy as part of the House Freedom Caucus and he joins the podcast to explain his support for Rep. Jordan, his confidence they will solve the speaker issue, and the need to avoid another approaching government shutdown.

Plus, commentary by Fox Nation host Tammy Bruce.

      <title>Evening Edition: Israel Prepares For Massive Ground Assault On Gaza </title>
      <description>The Israeli Defense Forces have ordered over a million residents of Gaza to evacuate prior to their expected ground invasion. The war that started ten days ago has become the deadliest conflict between the two sides already totaling more than four thousand dead. President Biden over the weekend said it would be a 'mistake' for Israel to occupy Gaza following a ground assault.    

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner of the Israeli Defense Forces who says they have been commanded to root out all of the Hamas terror group from Gaza.

      <title>Sen. Sullivan: Limiting Iran Is Key to Keep Israel-Hamas War From Worsening</title>
      <description>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer spent the weekend in Tel Aviv, meeting with Israeli officials as he crafts a bipartisan resolution that aims to financially support Israel and condemn Hamas for their brutal attacks. The White House is also making plans to send flights to the region to rescue Americans, as at least 14 remain unaccounted for. However, as the conflict between Hamas and Israel intensifies and innocent civilians continue to die, what else can the U.S. do to put a stop to this catastrophic violence? On the Rundown, Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) discusses how involved he believes the United States will get in this conflict and why ensuring Iran stays out of it is crucial to deter "a broadening" of this war across the Middle East. He also explains why the Biden Administration diminishing America's energy independence has put us in a vulnerable situation in the midst of violent chaos overseas.
 
As social media evolves, lawmakers are developing new measures to keep users' data safe. New York Governor Kathy Hochul (D-NY) proposed legislation last week that limits what minors can view online. The bill prevents those under eighteen from viewing "addictive feeds" without parental consent. Research associate in the Tech Policy Center at the Heritage Foundation, Jake Denton, joins the Rundown to explain how social media companies target user data, how their algorithms work, and why parents need to regain control of what their children do online.
 
Plus, commentary from James Carafano, Heritage Foundation's Vice President for Foreign &amp; Security policy.

      <title>Extra: Israel's 'New Reality'</title>
      <description>This week, FOX News Rundown host Jessica Rosenthal spoke with Susie Baumhol, a former New Yorker living in Tel Aviv who woke up last Saturday morning to a country under attack.
The sirens were not new, but a Hamas infiltration was.
We spoke to her early in the week. By then many horrific videos and pictures had been posted but more were to come.
Susie also talked to her about life in Israel, how this attack is different, and how things will never be the same.
We only used a very small portion of the discussion during a segment that aired this week but wanted to share the entire conversation with you. On today's FOX News Rundown you'll hear our entire unedited conversation with Susie Baumhol.

      <title>From Washington: The Future of U.S. Foreign Policy</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/10/15/from-washington-the-future-of-u-s-foreign-policy/</link>
      <description>Foreign policy has been a hot topic this election cycle but now is even more important following the Hamas attacks in Israel. Republican candidates former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy have sparred over their differing stances on the issue, however as candidates prepare for the third debate next month, they need to revamp their strategies to remain relevant in the race. Republican strategist Colin Reed joins to discuss why former President Donald Trump's foreign policy may help him get re-elected, why voters are leaning away from President Joe Biden, and why Nikki Haley may find herself in second place in the polls very soon.
Following the events in Israel, some Americans are now concerned about what this means for national security at home. Currently, there is no credible threat pointing toward the United States. However, as pro-Palestine protests pop up around the country, cities are making sure their law enforcement remains hypervigilant. Former FBI Investigator and International Security Expert, Bill Daly joins to discuss the events in Israel, cyber threats from Vietnam, and people on the terror watch list coming through the Southern border.

Republican candidates former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy have sparred over their differing stances on the issue, however as candidates prepare for the third debate next month, they need to revamp their strategies to remain relevant in the race. <strong>Republican strategist Colin Reed </strong>joins to discuss why former President Donald Trump's foreign policy may help him get re-elected, why voters are leaning away from President Joe Biden, and why Nikki Haley may find herself in second place in the polls very soon.</p><p>Following the events in Israel, some Americans are now concerned about what this means for national security at home.

      <title>Extra: "It's A Felony" ... Why Sen. Paul Says Dr. Fauci's Covid "Coverup" Was Criminal</title>
      <description>Senator Rand Paul and Dr. Anthony Fauci have famously sparred at Senate hearings about Covid and the theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese lab.
In his new book, "Deception: The Great Covid Cover-Up," Sen. Paul alleges that Dr. Fauci intentionally misled the American people during the pandemic. The book also points out what he calls the 'catastrophic' failures by the government and health officials during their response to the virus.
Sen. Paul recently sat down with the FOX News Rundown's Dave Anthony. They discussed the book, but also spent a lot of time on Hamas' attack on Israel last weekend.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Sen. Paul. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear the entire conversation that includes even more of why Sen. Paul believes there has been a 'great Covid cover-up' and Dr. Fauci may have committed a felony when he misled lawmakers about his actions during the pandemic.

      <title>From Washington: Inside The Horrors Of Hamas Attacks On Israel</title>
      <description>On Saturday, October 7th, a surprise attack led by Hamas terrorists killed more than 260 Israelis at the Tribe of Nova Trance music festival, held in an open field near Kibbutz Re’im. FOX News Audio Political Anchor and Washington Correspondent Jared Halpern speaks to Israeli citizens Sinai Morad and Arielle Barokas about their personal experiences living through what has become one of the most significant and horrific events of their lifetime.

The House Of Representatives is paralyzed, as no House Speaker nominee has reached 217 votes to ascend to the seat. In the meantime, Congressman Patrick McHenry of North Carolina is serving as the Speaker pro tempore, while the Republican conference works on electing the next Speaker. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the role that Rep. McHenry plays in the selection of the new Speaker, why Republicans are having such a hard time coming to a consensus on who will lead the party, and why it is imperative that Congress returns to normalcy.

      <title>Evening Edition: Israel Hopes To "Crush" Hamas With Ground Invasion</title>
      <description>Following a week of bombarding Hamas's home turf in the Gaza Strip, Israeli Defense Forces will soon mount an invasion, with tanks and boots on the ground in the congested streets of Gaza. While a ground assault will be dangerous for the IDF, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says it's the only way to achieve Israel's stated goal: 'crush Hamas.' Former Netanyahu spokesperson Mark Regev joins the FOX News Rundown: Evening Edition to explain how Israel has been urging civilians to leave Gaza. Regev also addresses claims that Israel is releasing false information about last Saturday's attacks by Hamas, or fringe claims that the brutal attack on Israel was justified.

      <title>Hostages In Gaza &amp; War On Israel Raises The Stakes For America</title>
      <description>At least two dozen Americans have been killed in Israel, with 14 more currently unaccounted for. President Biden declared the Hamas attack an "act of sheer evil," and now the US is racing to provide Israel with aid and rescue those currently trapped in the region. The House GOP continues to disagree over who they will elect to be their next speaker, which has paralyzed any possible aid packages from Congress. On the Rundown, FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream explains how the White House is handling the hostage crisis in Gaza, why it is crucial for Israel for Congress to get back to work, and how Republican presidential candidates have responded to the attacks on a U.S. ally.

It's been almost one week since Hamas unleashed a surprise attack on Israel. Since then, there have been hundreds of Israelis held hostage, unable to escape the violence. American-born Israeli venture capitalist at Aleph, Michael Eisenberg, lost his cousin at the start of the assault, and he now braces for the moment when his two sons will join the fight for their country. Eisenberg joins the Rundown to share his story, describe the devastation he has seen, and talk about what his charity, HaShomer HaChadash, is doing to support those affected by the bloodshed.

Plus, commentary by former White House speechwriter and Fox News Contributor Marc Thiessen.

      <title>Evening Edition: U.S. Military Sends Support To Israel...And A Clear Warning To Others In The Region</title>
      <description>The U.S. military has shifted its posture to support Israel. A second American aircraft carrier has been sent to the Middle East, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is set to arrive in Israel on Friday, and the first shipment of military aid has been received by Israel.

FOX News Chief National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin joins to explain how the U.S. warships sent to army bases in the Middle East act as a warning to the region of the consequences other nations or groups would face if they joined the fight against Israel. Later, she explains what role the U.S. may play in helping the hostages captured by Hamas and why supplying military aid to both Israel and Ukraine is extremely feasible for the U.S. military.

      <title>Bret Baier: "Israel Is In An Existential Fight To Take Out Hamas"</title>
      <description>The fighting in the Middle East promises to intensify, with Israel preparing for a siege of Gaza to root out the Hamas terrorists that massacred Israeli civilians over the weekend. Bret Baier, FOX's Chief Political Anchor, host of Special Report and the Bret Baier podcast, joins the Rundown to discuss concerns about who is funding terror organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, why comparing atrocities committed by the Hamas terrorists to the actions of the Israeli government is a dangerous moral equivalency, and he talks about his new book, “To Rescue the Constitution: George Washington and the Fragile American Experiment.”

Reports broke on Wednesday that Iran’s President Raisi and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman spoke on the phone, discussing the “need to end war crimes against Palestine.” This news brings fresh scrutiny to Iran’s role in the terror attacks on Israel, as Iran has been a long-standing sponsor of Hamas. Now, intelligence agencies are reevaluating Iran’s nuclear capabilities as well. Senior research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Security Studies Program, Dr. James Walsh, explains what we know about Iran’s involvement in the attack on Israel, how close Iran is to a nuclear weapon, and the threat of Islamic nations in the region joining the fight against Israel.

Plus, commentary by Heritage Foundation Tech Policy research associate Jake Denton.

Senior research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Security Studies Program, Dr. James Walsh, explains what we know about Iran’s involvement in the attack on Israel, how close Iran is to a nuclear weapon, and the threat of Islamic nations in the region joining the fight against Israel.</p><p><br></p><p>Plus, commentary by Heritage Foundation Tech Policy research associate Jake Denton.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>War In Israel Puts Renewed Focus On America’s Security</title>
      <description>As Israel grapples with the realities of war with the terrorist organization Hamas, President Biden assured that the United States is fully behind its ally Israel. The U.S. military will send ships and aircraft to Israel, as well as much-needed munitions. The death toll continues to rise, and currently fourteen Americans are confirmed to be among the dead. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) joins the Rundown to discuss why he thinks the U.S. should investigate Iran's involvement in the Hamas attacks, why the country must continue to support Israel, and his new book, “Deception: The Great COVID Cover-Up.”

Terror attacks on the world stage have reinvigorated national security concerns for our borders at home. So far this year, 151 people on the terror watchlist have been apprehended at the U.S. southern border. However border patrol cannot stop all illegal entries, in fact since January 2021 there have been an estimated 1.7 million migrant “gotaways.” On the Rundown, former Chief of US Border Patrol and retired acting ICE director Ronald Vitiello joins to discuss the concerns about ‘special interest aliens,’ the likelihood of national security threats with more terrorists attempting to enter the country illegally than years past and the failures of our current border policy.

Plus, commentary by columnist David Marcus.

      <description>More than a dozen Americans are dead and twenty or more others are missing and could be being held hostage following the terror attacks on Israel. Families all over Israel are filing into police stations looking for any word on the fate of their loved ones they have not seen in days. And then there are those serving in the Israeli Defense Forces that were stationed on the Gaza border when the attack broke out who are also missing.  

FOX's Alex Hogan speaks with Ruby Chen, born in America with Israeli citizenship, who is searching for his son, Itay, who is also American and was serving in the Israeli Defense Forces on the Gaza border the night the attack happened.

      <title>Israel Responds To Hamas Attacks: “The Hardest Days Are Yet To Come”</title>
      <description>Over the weekend, Israeli citizens awoke to the news that Israel was being attacked. Hamas militants infiltrated the country, shooting and killing innocent civilians while capturing others as hostages. Now, as Israel is fighting Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, some anticipate the war could evolve as the terrorist group Hezbollah has begun shooting rockets from Lebanon. We spoke to Israeli citizens who explained the difficult reality that their country is under attack. Anti-defamation League Director Jonathan Greenblatt joins the Rundown to break down the need for Americans to speak out against the atrocities committed against Israelis and the need for all of the media to tell the truth about the cruelty of Hamas.
 
On Sunday, President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that additional aid for the Israeli Defense Forces is on the way. With the war only days old, there are talks of the United States entering into battle to assist. However, Israel has never asked the U.S. for help, and such a request would be a historic first. Retired 4-star general, chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, and FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keane joins the Rundown to describe what kind of aid the United States will likely provide and why Israel should be inclined to ask for support.
 
Plus, commentary from host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Rep. Waltz: Israel War Makes A Speedy Speaker Vote Absolutely Critical</title>
      <description>Shock waves spread across the globe this weekend after Hamas militants led a surprise attack on Israel that has led to devastating killings, abductions, and injuries. On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged the U.S.'s "full support" to Israel as they continue battling what many people, including Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, believe could likely become a "long and difficult war." Meanwhile, those on Capitol Hill are recovering from the week after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted from his role -- while the government remains in danger of shutting down until members of Congress reach a consensus on next year's spending bills. In the middle of domestic and international chaos, Congressman Mike Waltz joins the Rundown to discuss why he's confident Iran is behind the attack on Israel and how the planned invasion represents a 'massive intelligence failure.' He also shares who he's supporting to be the next House speaker and his thoughts on Ukraine funding and securing the southern border.
The September jobs report showed the U.S. added 336,000 jobs, greatly surpassing economists' projections for growth as unemployment numbers remained level. With this red-hot labor market, experts predict the Fed is likely to raise interest rates soon. Co-anchor of "The Big Money Show" on FOX Business, Jackie DeAngelis, joins the Rundown to explain why a strong labor market is the opposite of what the Fed wants to see, the negative consequences of President Biden's economic policies, and a concerning figure in the jobs report that historically signals a coming recession.
Plus, commentary by former Congressman Jason Chaffetz, host of the Jason in the House podcast.

The September jobs report showed the U.S. added 336,000 jobs, greatly surpassing economists' projections for growth as unemployment numbers remained level. With this red-hot labor market, experts predict the Fed is likely to raise interest rates soon. Co-anchor of "The Big Money Show" on FOX Business, Jackie DeAngelis, joins the Rundown to explain why a strong labor market is the opposite of what the Fed wants to see, the negative consequences of President Biden's economic policies, and a concerning figure in the jobs report that historically signals a coming recession.
Plus, commentary by former Congressman Jason Chaffetz, host of the Jason in the House podcast.

        <![CDATA[<p>Shock waves spread across the globe this weekend after Hamas militants led a surprise attack on Israel that has led to devastating killings, abductions, and injuries. On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged the U.S.'s "full support" to Israel as they continue battling what many people, including Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, believe could likely become a "long and difficult war." Meanwhile, those on Capitol Hill are recovering from the week after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted from his role -- while the government remains in danger of shutting down until members of Congress reach a consensus on next year's spending bills. In the middle of domestic and international chaos, Congressman Mike Waltz joins the Rundown to discuss why he's confident Iran is behind the attack on Israel and how the planned invasion represents a 'massive intelligence failure.'

      <title>Extra: Questions Surround Trump's Civil Fraud Trial</title>
      <description>This past week was another historic one.
The House ousted its speaker, Kevin McCarthy, something it has never done before.
The Biden Administration announced they will resume construction of a wall along America's southern border. Breaking promises candidate Joe Biden made when running for President in 2020.
Former President Donald Trump, who is also the frontrunner in the 2024 GOP primary race, sat in a New York courtroom at a civil fraud trial against him and the Trump Organization.
FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream joined host Chris Foster on the FOX News Rundown to give her take on all of it, including legal analysis of the fraud case against Trump and why it could have huge implications on his businesses, but maybe not his campaign.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with FOX News Sunday's anchor Shannon Bream. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear her thoughts on the Trump civil case that were not heard in the original segment.

      <title>From Washington: So...Now What?</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/10/08/from-washington-so-now-what/</link>
      <description>In a historic vote, lawmakers ousted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from office on Tuesday. Although Republicans hold a slim majority, eight GOP lawmakers split from their party and sided with Democrats in the vote to remove McCarthy from the speakership. With the House Speaker role now vacant, many Republican lawmakers are now vying for the position. FOX News Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram reflects on the turmoil that unfolded on Capitol Hill this week and explains what led to Speaker McCarthy's removal from office.

Poll after poll shows that most Americans aren't thrilled with the idea of a rematch between President Biden and former President Trump. Talks of a third-party candidate continue to grow with Democrat candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. teasing the idea of running as an Independent. Meanwhile, the No Labels Party is working for ballot access in all 50 states so that voters can consider the idea of a 'unity ticket.'  Democratic Campaign Strategist and former Biden 2020 Campaign Surrogate Kevin Walling discusses the viability of a third-party option in 2024 and explains why he believes it could spoil the race.

      <title>Extra: A Republican "Rebel" Explains Why He Voted To Oust Kevin McCarthy</title>
      <description>For the first time in American history, the House ousted its speaker
Eight House Republicans, siding with the House Democrats, voted to remove Kevin McCarthy.
Those eight republican 'rebels' were quickly attacked by pundits and members of their own party, accused of trying to create 'chaos' or putting their own ambitions before the country.
A day after the vote, One of those GOP House members who voted to oust McCarthy, Congressman Tim Burchett (R-TN), joined host Dave Anthony on the FOX News Rundown to defend his historic vote.
Burchett explained his vote and responded to his GOP and media critics who he said are over exaggerating the impact of Kevin McCarthy's ouster. He explained why he is confident a new Speaker will be chosen quickly and Congress can avoid a shutdown before the November deadline.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Rep. Tim Burchett. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more about what happened before last Tuesday's historic vote and why he thinks new House leadership will be better for the country.

      <title>From Washington: McCarthy Ousted In Historic House Vote</title>
      <description>The other shoe finally dropped for Congressman Kevin McCarthy after a historic vote on the House floor to remove him as Speaker this week took less than an hour, as opposed to the days it took for him to win over the gavel on the 15th round of voting back in January. As much as the motion to vacate felt abrupt, it has long been threatened by both Democrats and Republicans alike. Republican Strategist and former Deputy Communications Director for former Speaker John Boehner, Mike Ricci shares why he believes Democrats did not bail the Speaker out, speculates the reasoning behind the lack of trust between representatives, and predicts that whoever fills this vacancy will face a multitude of competing priorities.

With the future of Republican leadership in the House of Representatives up in the air, what could become of future aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia? Many Republicans have voiced their opposition to further Ukraine aid in future spending bills, with the issue also driving a wedge between 2024 Presidential Candidates. Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO and Special Representative to Ukraine under former President Trump, Kurt Volker discusses why it is imperative that the U.S. continues aid to Ukraine, what European nations are doing to help with the war effort, and how America's political situation factors into Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans for the war.

      <title>White House Backtracks on Border Wall</title>
      <description>President Joe Biden campaigned on this promise: his administration “won’t construct another foot of border wall.” The White House has flipped on this, recently waiving almost two dozen federal laws in south Texas to resume construction on the Trump-era border wall project. Communities have been pleading for solutions at the U.S. southern border, with over two hundred thousand illegal migrant entries recorded this year. FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to share what pushed the administration to take action at the border and later weighs in on the “chaos” in Congress.

During Mental Health Awareness Week, experts are expressing concern about the state of mental health in America. CDC statistics show that one in eight U.S. adults is on antidepressant medications, and one in five seeks and receives mental health care services. Meanwhile, data shows American suicide, depression, and anxiety are still rising. Licensed psychotherapist and author of "Disconnected," Tom Kersting, joins the podcast to explain what has accelerated the downfall of mental health in America, powerful methods for coping with mental illness, and the negative impact of smartphones on the health of today’s youth.

      <itunes:summary>President Joe Biden campaigned on this promise: his administration “won’t construct another foot of border wall.” The White House has flipped on this, recently waiving almost two dozen federal laws in south Texas to resume construction on the Trump-era border wall project. Communities have been pleading for solutions at the U.S. southern border, with over two hundred thousand illegal migrant entries recorded this year. FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to share what pushed the administration to take action at the border and later weighs in on the “chaos” in Congress.

During Mental Health Awareness Week, experts are expressing concern about the state of mental health in America. CDC statistics show that one in eight U.S. adults is on antidepressant medications, and one in five seeks and receives mental health care services. Meanwhile, data shows American suicide, depression, and anxiety are still rising. Licensed psychotherapist and author of "Disconnected," Tom Kersting, joins the podcast to explain what has accelerated the downfall of mental health in America, powerful methods for coping with mental illness, and the negative impact of smartphones on the health of today’s youth.

      <title>Evening Edition: Largest Healthcare Strike In U.S. History Enters Second Day  </title>
      <description>The largest health care workers strike in U.S. history entered its second day as over seventy thousand people took to the picket lines in multiple states. Union workers for Kaiser Permanente, which represents over eighty thousand healthcare employees, walked out and joined picket lines in various California cities.

      <title>A GOP House Divided</title>
      <description>Kevin McCarthy was ousted from his role as Speaker of the House, the first time in history that such an event has occurred. Eight House Republicans voted to remove McCarthy, with House Democrats unanimously following suit. With the unprecedented vacancy, now acting Speaker, Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC), has declared a recess until both parties can agree on how to move forward. On the Rundown, Congressman Tim Burchett (R-TN), one of the few Republicans to vote against McCarthy, shares the reasoning behind his decision, why he believes this change was necessary, and who may be tapped to fill this high position.
 
After Tuesday’s ousting of Speaker McCarthy, the question now remains: when will the GOP be able to place a new representative in the position? Republicans have voiced confidence that they will be able to quickly name a new speaker, and various names have been floated: Rep. Steve Scalise, Rep. Tom Emmer, Rep. Jim Jordan, and even former President Trump. Trey Gowdy, Host of The Trey Gowdy Podcast and Sunday Night in America, joins the Rundown to discuss why he believes a new speaker will encounter many of the same issues as McCarthy did, his fears that Congress is no longer serious about confronting our mounting debt, and what kind of lasting impact this ousting will have for the GOP.

      <title>Evening Edition: Are Violent Crimes Caught On Video Desensitizing Us, Or A Call To Action?  </title>
      <description>Violent crimes continue to rise in large cities across America with many of the incidents being caught on video. Both cell phones and surveillance cameras have become key in criminal investigations but how are we reacting to the constant stream of violence? Some say they are desensitized and others say it shows how bad crime, especially in big cities, is rising.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Paul Mauro, attorney, former NYPD inspector and co-founder of 'Ops Desk', about various examples of violent crimes caught on video and the impact on the public.

      <title>President Biden’s Age Becoming Bigger Concern For Democrats</title>
      <description>A recent Monmouth University poll indicates that many Americans think President Joe Biden is too old to be re-elected. The now-80-year-old has been subject to scrutiny throughout his term for frequent gaffes and concerns about his cognitive ability. Pollster and president of Maslansky+Partners, Lee Carter, joins the Rundown to talk about what the polls are telling us about the state of voter confidence and the possibility of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. running as an independent candidate.
 
Homeownership has become unaffordable in 99 percent of the country, according to new real estate data. The average American income earner takes home approximately $71,000 a year, while the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,702. That’s about $20,000 a year, meaning the poverty guideline for one person doesn’t even cover rent. Experts like Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman told FOX Business that the market may be at “rock bottom,” but he anticipates it could get worse. Is the American dream of owning a home no longer within reach? FOX Business’ Gerri Willis joins the podcast to explain how homeownership became unattainable and what future buyers must do to keep the dream within reach.
 
Plus, commentary by a former investment banker and author of 'You Will Own Nothing,' Carol Roth.

      <title>Congress Still Split Over Border, Ukraine Funding</title>
      <description>Congress narrowly avoided a government shutdown this past week, working late into Saturday to pass a short-term spending bill that funds the government until November 17th. While some Republican lawmakers, like Florida Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL), are looking to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, other GOP members are expressing satisfaction that they were able to strike a deal for the American people. Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joins the Rundown to discuss this weekend's deal and touches on why the U.S. doesn't have to sacrifice Ukraine's aid funding to help fund resources at the southern border.

The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried begins today. The 31-year-old once ran a crypto-empire worth billions, but after the collapse of his company, FTX, customers of the cryptocurrency exchange found that nearly $8 billion was missing. In court, prosecutors will lay out the case against SBF in what experts are calling one of the biggest financial fraud cases in U.S. history. FOX Business correspondent Kelly O'Grady is the host of the new podcast, "The Trial of Sam Bankman-Fried," where she will cover the twists and turns of the trial that threatens to put the FTX founder behind bars for life. She explains the financial fraud that SBF stands accused of and the shockwaves of panic this is causing within the crypto industry.

Plus, commentary from Pastor Robert Jeffress of the Dallas First Baptist Church.

      <itunes:summary>Congress narrowly avoided a government shutdown this past week, working late into Saturday to pass a short-term spending bill that funds the government until November 17th. While some Republican lawmakers, like Florida Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL), are looking to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, other GOP members are expressing satisfaction that they were able to strike a deal for the American people. Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joins the Rundown to discuss this weekend's deal and touches on why the U.S. doesn't have to sacrifice Ukraine's aid funding to help fund resources at the southern border.

The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried begins today. The 31-year-old once ran a crypto-empire worth billions, but after the collapse of his company, FTX, customers of the cryptocurrency exchange found that nearly $8 billion was missing. In court, prosecutors will lay out the case against SBF in what experts are calling one of the biggest financial fraud cases in U.S. history. FOX Business correspondent Kelly O'Grady is the host of the new podcast, "The Trial of Sam Bankman-Fried," where she will cover the twists and turns of the trial that threatens to put the FTX founder behind bars for life. She explains the financial fraud that SBF stands accused of and the shockwaves of panic this is causing within the crypto industry.

Plus, commentary from Pastor Robert Jeffress of the Dallas First Baptist Church.

      <title>Government Shutdown Averted...For Now.</title>
      <description>After weeks of anticipating a government shutdown, the House and Senate were able to avert it — passing a last-minute spending bill that funds the government until November 17th. However, questions remain about whether lawmakers can reach a consensus on next year’s spending by this deadline, especially as several hardliners in Washington strongly disagree on Ukraine funding. With the shutdown out of the way for now, House Republicans are focusing on their impeachment inquiry into President Biden. A hearing was held last Thursday…with Republicans saying they have evidence to back an impeachment. Democrats said no, they don’t. On the Rundown, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO) discusses how House Republicans plan to act wisely so a government shutdown is not a threat come November 17th. He also explains why there is talk of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s leadership role being in jeopardy despite his success in avoiding a shutdown and how House Republicans are “following the facts” as they investigate the President.
Federal student loan repayments resume this month for millions of Americans after being paused during the COVID-19 pandemic. After the three-year-long pause, many borrowers fear that they won’t be able to make their monthly payments due to high inflation and an elevated cost of living. Earlier this year, President Joe Biden announced a year-long grace period waving the penalties for missed payments as a way to ease the burden. Senior Editor for CNET Money, Nick Wolny, joins the Rundown to break down the benefits of the Biden administration’s SAVE Plan, how people are relying too much on their credit cards, and what you can do to avoid common student loan-related scams.
Plus, commentary by David Marcus, author of “Charade: The Covid Lies That Crushed A Nation.”

      <title>Extra: Why Some Schools Are Considering A Return To Remote Learning</title>
      <description>The COVID-19 pandemic shined a spotlight on remote education.

For many, families and teachers found it challenge and blame that period of the recent decline of test scores.

But now that children have mostly returned to the classroom, schools are finding it increasingly difficult to staff teachers. 

The problem is so bad in some cases, districts across the country are resorting back to remote learning and reaching out to third-party companies to employ instructors to educate students from miles away via an online connection. 

Earlier this month, host the FOX News Rundown's Lisa Brady spoke with Susan Moore Johnson, research professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and Evan Erdberg, founder and former president of Proximity Learning Inc. about remote learning and whether it could help with the ongoing challenges the education system is facing. 

The guests provided the pros and cons of the issue and discussed how best to address learning loss and our country's teacher shortage

We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversations with both education experts Susan Moore Johnson and Evan Erdberg. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll learn even more about the debate over remote learning and the issues facing our school.

      <description>The surge at the southern border continues to get worse, as border sources tell FOX News they surpassed the number of migrant encounters from last year with nearly 2.4 million people. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisles are pointing blame and telling each other to act. Former Senior Law Enforcement Advisor to DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, Charles Marino joins to discuss what's fueling the crisis, why he believes the cartels have never been more powerful than ever under the Biden administration, and shares why the country needs to gain operational control of the southern border before prioritizing immigration reform.
Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly calling for the resignation of New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez following his latest indictment alleging he took bribes from the Egyptian government. FOX News Contributor and Attorney Sol Wisenberg joins to discuss the legal implications of the charges against Senator Menendez, and how strong of a case the government has. Plus, Sol Wisenberg, who was deputy independent counsel in the investigation that led to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, weighs in on the impeachment inquiry of President Biden.

      <title>Extra: Shoplifting Is Big Business For Criminals</title>
      <description>Retailers call it shrink. The rest of us call it theft. 

An increase in shoplifting and looting has some big retail chains closing stores in big cities. 

Earlier this week, the FOX News Rundown's Dave Anthony spoke with Former Target Vice Chairman Gerald Storch about how crime is forcing companies to rethink how and where they operate.

While theft has always been a concern for businesses, Storch explained how the current surge compares to the past and why he thinks it will get worse before it gets better.

He also explained criminals know how take advantage of our justice system and use stolen merchandise to make major profits with little risk.

We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversations with retail expert Gerald Storch. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll learn even more about why shoplifting is on the rise and how it's become big business for the bad guys.

      <title>From Washington: The Cost Of A Government Shutdown</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/09/30/from-washington-the-cost-of-a-government-shutdown/</link>
      <description>What happens. . . and doesn’t happen during a government shutdown? And what are the economic and political costs of one? FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram looks back at previous shutdowns and the spending fights that caused them. Later, he looks back at the career and legacy of the late Senator Dianne Feinstein.
Seven of the Republican candidates took the GOP debate stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California on Wednesday, attempting to stand out and hopefully give their campaigns a boost. However, it's still a question as to whether they were able to land a significant punch on former President Donald Trump, who was absent for the event and continues to be the overwhelming frontrunner in the Republican 2024 nomination race. Anchor of The Story on the FOX News Channel and Co-Moderator of the first 2023 GOP Debate Martha MacCallum gives her take on the evening, who she thinks could see a bounce in the polls.

      <title>Evening Edition: Republicans Hold First Biden Impeachment Inquiry  </title>
      <description>Republicans held their first impeachment inquiry hearing into President Biden Thursday which involved speaking to a string of legal experts. The hearing quickly got heated while Republicans claimed there is plenty of evidence linking President Biden to his son's foreign business dealings. The White House fired back today saying that the impeachment hearing distracted from the looming government shutdown. 

FOX's Ryan Schmelz speaks with FOX's David Spunt, Washington D.C.-based correspondent, about yesterday's hearing and where it may go from here.

      <title>Shannon Bream: GOP Field Struggling To Produce A Serious Challenge To Trump</title>
      <description>Candidates sparred on the economy, social media, and healthcare in Simi Valley, California, where the GOP presidential candidates are hoping to be the ones to take on former President Trump for the nomination. Meanwhile, in Washington, journalists and lawmakers alike are forecasting that a government shutdown is nearly certain to come in the next few days. On the Rundown, FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to explain how combative energy played for some candidates in the FOX Business debate and the ground being gained by former Ambassador Nikki Haley. Later, she explains how a government shutdown affects Americans and the policy split in the GOP over spending.

Retailers call it shrink. The rest of us call it theft. An increase in shoplifting and looting has some big retail chains closing stores in big cities. Former Target Vice Chairman Gerald Storch discusses how crime is forcing companies to rethink how and where they operate. 

Plus, commentary by Jason Rantz, Host of the Jason Rantz Show and author of "What’s Killing America."

      <title>Who Stood Out At the Second GOP Presidential Debate?</title>
      <description>The seven candidates who qualified for the second Republican presidential debate took the stage last night at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. After the first debate proved to have an evident impact on voters, with many polls showing South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley’s numbers rising while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis took a hit, many Americans anticipated how last night’s debate would continue shaping the Republican presidential field. Did the debate have a clear “winner,” and how could the eventful night impact former President Donald Trump’s lead in the polls? On the Rundown, FOX News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar and FOX News Radio Congressional Correspondent Jared Halpern discuss which candidates had a successful night, why they believe the majority of those on stage missed the mark when discussing the economy, and who they believe did well enough to make it to the next debate.

Earlier this week, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy rejected a stopgap spending bill in the Senate, bringing the U.S. government that much closer to a potential shutdown. If House Republicans do not agree on a deal by October 1st, thousands of government workers will be furloughed until an agreement is reached. U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg joins the podcast to explain the true impact of a government shutdown. He shared how exactly an event like this would compromise flight safety and cause delays. He weighs in on the role electric vehicles are playing in the United Auto Workers’ Strike and why it will be important for America to embrace EVs in the long run.
 
Plus, commentary from host of OutKick’s Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Who Needs A Breakout Moment At Tonight’s Debate?</title>
      <description>Tonight, Americans can tune into the second GOP presidential debate hosted by FOX Business and Univision. The moderators--Dana Perino, Stuart Varney, and Ilia Calderón--will guide the discussion for the seven candidates on the stage, addressing the issues that voters are most concerned about. The job of the moderator can be a difficult one, tasked with creating debate while maintaining civility. On the Rundown, FOX Business' Stuart Varney says this debate will have all the candidates "pressing hard to make a breakthrough." On the podcast, he explains how this debate will give candidates a chance to discuss big-picture issues for the economy and his plans to encourage more substantive debate between the contenders on stage.
 
The latest FOX News poll shows that former President Donald Trump remains the party's frontrunner, with nearly a fifty-point lead ahead of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. However, Trump will remain absent from the debate stage this week, maintaining his promise to not participate in any GOP primary debates. After candidates like Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy made headway in the first debate, now candidates are seeking break-out moments the second time around. Karl Rove, former senior advisor, Deputy White House Chief of Staff, and FOX News Contributor, joins the Rundown to reflect on what the candidates did well the first time around and explain why early national polls are not an indicator of the eventual nominee.
 
Plus, commentary by Republican strategist and co-founder of South &amp; Hill Strategies, Colin Reed.

      <title>Evening Edition: President Biden Joins UAW Picket Line  </title>
      <description>President Biden walked the United Auto Workers picket line in Michigan Tuesday becoming the first U.S. president to join striking workers in modern history. President Biden told workers he is backing their call for a forty percent pay increase. Donald Trump, who tomorrow visits a non-union plant to speak to the UAW, called the visit by Biden a 'PR stunt'.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with FOX Business Network's Jeff Flock, in Warren, Michigan, about the historic visit, what the President said about the work stop and where the strike stands at this point.

      <title>RNC Chair: To Win, GOP Must Sell 'Alternative to Bidenomics'</title>
      <description>FOX Business will host the second Republican presidential debate in Simi Valley, California, at 9:00 P.M. ET on Wednesday. With the business network hosting this event, there is likely to be more substantial discussions about the state of the U.S. economy, which recent polling shows a strong majority of Americans are both pessimistic and worried about. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel joins the podcast to explain her hopes that the FOX Business debate will give the 2024 candidates an opportunity to pitch their fix to America’s struggling economy. She explains why she believes Republicans are well-trusted on economic policy, what she predicts a Trump-Biden rematch might look like, and how the GOP can litigate the issue of abortion on the campaign trail.
 
There were eleven thousand migrant encounters at the southern border from Sunday to Monday—the most in a twenty-four-hour period. This year, the country has exceeded the record number of illegal crossings, with nearly 2.4 million migrants entering the United States. Thousands of asylum seekers have been bussed to sanctuary cities across the country to combat the surge, but now some of these mayors are demanding the federal government contribute resources to help care for newly arriving migrants. FOX's Washington-based correspondent, Griff Jenkins, joins the Rundown from Eagle Pass, Texas, to discuss how overwhelmed the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officials are now, why the majority of migrants entering Texas are first coming from Venezuela, and why the Biden administration favors releases versus the "Remain in Mexico" policy.
 
Plus, commentary by FOX News contributor Deroy Murdock.

      <title>Evening Edition: Sen. Menendez Remains Defiant Despite Growing Calls To Resign</title>
      <description>Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) held a press conference Monday saying he will not resign and is confident he will be exonerated of all charges. It was the Senator's first public appearance since a federal indictment was unsealed against him alleging he used his position as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to help Egypt in exchange for cash, gold bars and a Mercedes. Even fellow Democrats have joined the chorus of members of Congress calling on Senator Menendez to resign.  

FOX's Ryan Schmelz speaks with Chad Pergram, FOX News Senior Congressional correspondent, about Senator Menendez's press conference today, what he said and what sort of political implications these charges have for both parties.

      <title>Can Congress Avoid A Shutdown?</title>
      <description>With the end of the fiscal year coming this Saturday lawmakers must work on a funding extension or risk a government shutdown. GOP leadership in the House is hoping to pass bills that would put them in a better negotiating position with a Democrat-controlled Senate without angering the right flank of the party. Key issues such as funding for the War in Ukraine as well as the border crisis headlining the negotiations. Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS) is the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee. Sen. Wicker joins Mike Emanuel on the FOX News Rundown to discuss the negotiations, the border, the War in Ukraine and more.
Illinois has become the first state to eliminate cash bail with the "Pretrial Fairness Act," after lawmakers in the state criticized the current system for disproportionately affecting minorities and those not wealthy enough to afford bail. With cashless bail, prosecutors now have to request detentions, and judges must use their discretion to jail people awaiting trial to keep violent criminals off the street. However, critics of the law say posting bail is an incentive for people to show up for their court dates. Former DC Police Detective, defense attorney, and FOX News Contributor Ted Williams joins the Rundown to explain why he breaks down the debate over cashless bail and fears that this amended justice system could favor criminals over law-abiding citizens.
Plus, commentary from FOX News Medical Contributor and Professor at New York University Langone Health, Dr. Marc Siegel.

      <title>Extra: Climate Change, Politics And The UAW Strike</title>
      <description>The United Auto Workers went on strike against the 'big three' car makers - Ford, GM and Stellantis - earlier this month.
That is the first time they've all been targeted at the same time,
The automakers have offered the UAW pay raises, but say the cost of transitioning to electric cars prevents them from meeting all the union's demands.
We recently spoke with FOX Business correspondent Jeff flock and former Labor Department economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth about the issues at the center of this strike, and how workers pay, climate change policy and politics have all factored in.
The segment also touched on whether rapidly advancing technology has created anxiety among workers in a variety of industries, and if we more labor disputes and work stoppages should be expected.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with both FBN's Jeff Flock and economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more of their analysis of the UAW strike, and why there appears to be so many labor disputes in the country

      <title>From Washington: GOP Candidates Get Ready For The Second Debate</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/09/24/from-washington-gop-candidates-get-ready-for-the-second-debate/</link>
      <description>With The Fox Business Network-Univision Republican presidential primary debate just days away, who are the candidates to watch? The latest FOX News Power Rankings were released this past week, showing that former President Trump still holds a firm lead against his competitors. The rankings also highlighted how voters overwhelmingly favored “populist” candidates, like the former President and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, over their "conservative" opponents. Co-Anchor of 'America’s Newsroom' Bill Hemmer joins to discuss the rise of the “populist” Republicans, the issues he expects to come up during Wednesday’s second GOP debate, and Nikki Haley’s chances of having a stand-out moment on the stage.

This week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the United States, addressing the United Nations General Assembly in New York and later heading to Washington to make the case for more U.S. aid. As lawmakers fight over our own budget, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other Republicans seem reluctant to commit to any requests made by Ukraine. However, President Joe Biden announced a new $325 million aid package for the war-torn country. FOX News Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst joins to discuss why America's reaction to Zelenskyy's visit was different than last year and explains the current state of the war.

      <title>Extra: Why The GOP 'Holdouts' Are Holding Out, Risking A Government Shutdown</title>
      <description>The government has just days to avert a government. 
If the Congress fails to pass either a short-term or full-year spending bill by next Saturday evening, federal agencies will end non-essential functions starting October 1st.
However, a small group of Republicans are refusing to go along with their House colleagues to pass a short-term solution.
One of those GOP holdouts is Montana Republican Congressman Matt Rosendale.
Rep. Rosendale joined the Rundown's Dave Anthony earlier this week to explain why he and few other Republicans are defying Speaker Kevin McCarthy. He explained why he wants to use this opportunity to take a stand against overspending and feels his party's leadership is folding to the Democrats.
Rosendale also discussed the possibility of Kevin McCarthy losing his leadership role in the House.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Rep. Matt Rosendale. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more of his take on government spending, and why he doesn't fear a shutdown.

      <title>From Washington: Can McCarthy Avoid A Shutdown And Keep The Speakers Gavel</title>
      <description>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his Republican allies have been working to prevent a government shutdown next weekend, but are facing pushback from members of the Freedom Caucus. The inter-party conflict has created paralysis in the House, and members will have a short window to prevent a shutdown when they return to Capitol Hill Tuesday. Meanwhile, in the Senate, there is controversy over the new relaxed dress code, and senators like Pennsylvania's John Fetterman who are now opting out of their formalwear. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram has the scoop on shutdowns, spending bills, and sweatpants on the Senate floor.
 
With only a few months left until the 2023 Kentucky gubernatorial election, Democratic Incumbent Governor Andy Beshear and challenger Attorney General Daniel Cameron are gearing up their campaigns. Voters there will decide whether they want to keep the state blue...or flip it back to their traditional red. Political Science Associate Professor at the University of Kentucky Dr. Stephen Voss shares his insight as to whether he thinks Beshear, although well-liked, can survive in a deeply red state and whether Cameron campaigning on a very strict abortion policy will fly in the bluegrass state.

      <title>Evening Edition: GOP Works To Avoid Shutdown Despite Division In Party  </title>
      <description>Congress has just ten days to come to a compromise and avert a government shutdown on the first of October. The House currently seems to be unable to pass anything, including the GOP's defense spending bill that failed this week. Negotiations are set to continue over the weekend with a stopgap funding bill being a possible solution, but no one is confident a shutdown will be avoided.
FOX's Ryan Schmelz speaks with Rep. August Pfluger (R-TX), part of the GOP negotiations team, about where talks stand, possible solutions for compromise and his concerns moderate Republicans will be forced to ally with Democrats.

      <title>VP Mike Pence Makes The Case For 'Conservatism' &amp; Himself</title>
      <description>The second Republican debate is coming up next week at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California. The qualifications to make the stage are stricter this time, with candidates needing to meet higher polling and donor requirements. Six of the eight candidates from the first debate are projected to return, with North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson not yet qualifying. FOX News' latest power rankings show former Vice President Mike Pence in sixth place behind former President Donald Trump, and he joined the podcast to discuss the state of the 2024 race. He tells the Rundown that he is disappointed in his former running mate's decision not to debate and shares why he thinks he is the most qualified conservative in the race.

The price tag of a four-year college degree continues to rise; in fact, the cost has increased by 79 percent since 1995. At the end of August, President Biden said his administration was committed to making a college education "an affordable ticket to the middle class" via loan forgiveness programs. He unveiled the SAVE plan—the administration’s second attempt at federal student debt forgiveness after the first was defeated in the Supreme Court. But college enrollment has dropped well below pre-pandemic levels, while trade school enrollment numbers continue to grow. Former White House economist and author of “Making College Pay,” Beth Akers, joins the podcast to explain why a new generation is questioning the value of a four-year degree, the factors boosting trade schools as an alternative path, and the threat that student loan forgiveness may pose in the long term.

Plus, commentary by author and vice president of communications for Focus on The Family, Paul Batura.

      <title>Evening Edition: Britain Changes Course On Green Initiatives</title>
      <description>British Prime Minister Richi Sunak announced that the U.K. will be pausing a ban on new gas and diesel cars, a measure that was supposed to be in place by 2030. Sunak said Britain's climate goals were financially impacting the average citizen too much. The Prime Minister was the first British head of state in a decade not to attend the United Nations General Assembly where the topic of climate change was a major talking point. 

FOX's John Saucier speaks with Alex Hogan, FOX News Foreign Correspondent based in London, about the walk back on climate change goals and reaction to the decision.

      <title>Republicans Picking 'Populists' In Primary Race</title>
      <description>The Fox News Power Rankings are out, and they paint a picture of the 2024 GOP presidential races as a competition between populist candidates and traditional conservatives. The latest FOX Business polls show former President Trump maintains a large lead in the race both in Iowa and South Carolina. As the next GOP primary debate is set to take place on September 27th, the FOX Business polls show that voters have thrown more support for former Ambassador Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy since the first debate; however, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is still the number two in the race. FOX News Decision Desk Director Arnon Mishkin joins the Rundown to explain the increasing popularity of populist GOP candidates, the rising candidates in the race, and the factors allowing former President Trump to sustain a large lead over his challengers.

Following the pandemic, more parents began seeking more options for their children's education instead of their local public school. This prompted several states across the country to enact legislation to provide different options and give parents the power of school choice. For example, Arizona provides vouchers for students to attend private schools, and Iowa offers an education savings account to eligible families to cover tuition, fees, and other education-related expenses. Brian Brenberg, co-host of "The Big Money Show" on FOX Business, is focusing on school choice as part of FBN's weeklong series on "Education in America." On the Rundown, he shares why more parents are turning to alternative options, explains the rise in charter schools' popularity, and breaks down how COVID-19 may have placed students behind academically.

Plus, commentary by Fox News contributor Liz Peek.

      <title>Evening Edition: Congress Questions Sec. Buttigieg On Flight Delays And Rail Safety</title>
      <description>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg testified before The House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee today who grilled him on a summer of air travel troubles, rail safety and the administration's push on electric vehicles. Secretary Buttigieg said that flight cancellations are down to pre-COVID days and touted thousands of infrastructure projects in all states. The state of air travel in the United States was the focus though, with the FAA without a head administrator and the looming government shutdown which would have a large impact on air traffic controllers.  

FOX's John Saucier speaks with Chad Pergram, FOX News Chief Congressional Correspondent, about the testimony from the Secretary, where the spending bill fight stands and later touches on the Senate relaxing their dress code.

      <title>GOP Spending Fight Tests Speaker McCarthy's Leadership</title>
      <description>To avoid a government shutdown, Congress has until the end of September to pass a new spending bill. Currently, House Republicans are unable to reach a consensus on defense spending and move forward with a proposed short-term solution. Speaker McCarthy’s proposed GOP plan included approximately 8 percent in budget cuts, allocating no money for military aid to Ukraine but did provide funds to bolster border security measures. A procedural vote on Tuesday effectively defeated the GOP plan, with Republican lawmakers fighting internally about where spending is most needed. One of the few naysayers, Republican Congressman Matt Rosendale (R-MT), joins the Rundown to share why he is not worried about the possibility of a shutdown and why he lobbied against the continuing resolution.

Seventy percent of Americans say transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete in sports on teams that match their birth gender. The issue has stirred controversy across schools in the United States, with some parents of female athletes voicing opposition to what they see as an unfair advantage, while more liberal countries have had the community argue this backlash is LGBTQ+ discrimination. The debate has the Biden administration in a difficult spot, with Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre telling FBN there is no "yes or no answer" for this issue. Meanwhile, 2024 GOP candidate Nikki Haley has called this the "women’s issue of our time," criticizing the Biden administration for allowing "biological men to compete in women’s sports." On the Rundown, FOX Business' Hillary Vaughn is covering this as part of FBN's weeklong series on "Education in America,'' and she breaks down the trans athlete controversy and how lawmakers are addressing these concerns.

Plus, commentary from Hollywood actor and film producer, Kevin Sorbo.

      <description>President Biden addressed the United Nations General Assembly today in New York City as tens of thousands of migrants continue to pour into the self-proclaimed 'sanctuary city'. The President's remarks had a focus on the Ukraine-Russia conflict and did not touch on the ongoing immigration crisis. This as protests were held outside the United Nations condemning the Iran prisoner swap deal that was made.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with FOX Business Network's Madison Alworth, at the United Nations in New York, about the the President's speech, what was said and what wasn't said about the migrant crisis.

      <title>How Politics Is Driving The Auto Workers' Strike</title>
      <description>The United Auto Workers have been on strike for five days, with the union issuing demands for higher pay from the big car companies, who they argue are overpaying their executives while underpaying their laborers. UAW President Shawn Fain organized an aggressive, unprecedented strike on assembly plants at Ford, General Motor and Stellantis. As the labor negotiations continue, President Biden has voiced support for the strike while former President Trump has shared criticism of UAW union leadership. Fox Business' Jeff Flock joins the Rundown to explain Fain's plans with this strike and the public support for the union. Later, former Labor Department economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth breaks down the politics and policies that drove workers towards this strike.

In Fairfax County, Virginia, parents have recently voiced concern about the race and gender education curriculum in their schools. Even on a national scale, the teaching of these topics in classrooms has become a major conversation on the 2024 campaign trail. From Governor Ron DeSantis introducing Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act to Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin banning schools from teaching "divisive concepts like critical race theory," parents and politicians alike are paying more attention to the curriculum. On the Rundown, FOX Business' Edward Lawrence, who is focusing on the curriculum controversy as part of FBN's weeklong series on "Education in America," shares why some parents are criticizing the public education system and details how different states are challenging these issues.

On the Rundown, FOX Business' Edward Lawrence, who is focusing on the curriculum controversy as part of FBN's weeklong series on "Education in America," shares why some parents are criticizing the public education system and details how different states are challenging these issues.</p><p><br></p><p>Plus, commentary from host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Evening Edition: Five Americans Returning Home After Iran Prisoner Swap  </title>
      <description>Five American citizens have been released from Iranian prisons in an exchange that returned six billion dollars in frozen funds and five Iranian prisoners being held in the United States to Tehran. Iran has conducted a cold-blooded hostage policy that they have been mastering since the Islamic regime took power in 1979, with the kidnapping of the American diplomats from the embassy in Tehran. Iran’s long history of kidnapping Western hostages in exchange for all sorts of concessions has impacted people from the United States, various European countries, Australia and other countries around the world.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Behnam Ben Taleblu, Senior Fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, about this latest exchange and how kidnapping foreigners has become seemingly successful for Iran.

      <title>Americans Divided Over Biden Impeachment Inquiry</title>
      <description>House Republicans made major moves last week, as Speaker Kevin McCarthy directed the House to initiate an impeachment inquiry into President Biden in light of his potentially corrupt business dealings. Additionally, the House Committee on Homeland Security continues investigating the injustices at the southern border. This week, they will host a hearing focused on the financial cost of the border crisis, examining how many American taxpayers now face overwhelming financial burdens due to millions of migrants illegally crossing the border. On the Rundown, Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Mark Green (R-TN) shares his thoughts on House Republicans' impeachment inquiry into President Biden &amp; what he believes it could reveal. He also discusses how Americans facing higher medical bills, insurance rates, and even gas prices may all correlate to the mass number of migrants now residing in the U.S. and his efforts to keep "obscene" materials out of schools across America.
Approximately fifty million children across the country were abruptly tossed into remote learning during the pandemic. Three years later, students and teachers now grapple with the effects of learning loss in the classroom. Test scores are the lowest they've been in years, with kids unable to meet standard grade-level requirements. On the Rundown, FOX Business' Lydia Hu, who is focusing on learning loss as part of FBN's weeklong series on "Education in America," shares why parents are frustrated with the "equitable grading" system and breaks down how learning loss may snowball into even bigger problems for future generations.
Plus, commentary by General Counsel for NetChoice, Carl Szabo.

      <title>Extra: A Week Full Of Bad News For President Biden</title>
      <description>It was quite a week for the President and his family.
A grand jury in Delaware returned an indictment Thursday against his son, Hunter Biden, on three counts connected to making a false statement about drug use during a firearm purchase. 
The historic indictment comes as part of a broader investigation led by special counsel David Weiss into foreign income and potential tax offenses by Hunter.
Concerns over those foreign deals and his father's possible involvement in them were also the basis for a House impeachment inquiry that was launched against the President earlier this week.  
FOX News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream spoke with the Rundown's Jared Halpern shortly after Hunter Biden was indicted to break down the charges. 
Bream also discussed how his son's legal problems and the impeachment investigation could hurt President Joe Biden politically at a time when he's already suffering in the polls.  
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with FOX News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more of Shannon Bream's analysis of a historic week in politics.

      <title>From Washington: Amid Age Concerns, White House Touts Policy Achievements</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/09/17/from-washington-amid-age-concerns-white-house-touts-policy-achievements/</link>
      <description>President Biden returned from his latest overseas trip at the G20 Summit to renewed concerns over his age and mental capabilities. The White House has answered those concerns by pointing to the President's recent rigorous schedule and touting policy achievements from "Bidenomics" to foreign policy. FOX News Washington-Based Correspondent Mark Meredith joins to discuss the significance of President Biden's visit at the G20 Summit, how his schedule may continue to ramp up leading into the 2024 Election, and what he can continue to do to stave off concerns surrounding his age.
 
Critics from both ends of the political spectrum are calling for answers as many border communities and sanctuary cities across the country are struggling to keep up with the influx of migrants. Some blame the Biden administration's border policies; others blame the lack of law enforcement. FOX News Contributor and former State Department Spokesperson, Marie Harf explains why politicians need to come up with realistic solutions and explains why the argument for a living wage coincides with the nation's border crisis.

      <title>Extra: Gov. Sununu On The GOP Race, Gerrymandering, And Why "Good" People Don't Run For Office</title>
      <description>Former President Trump continues to hold a big lead over his GOP rivals.
He currently leads in both national polls and in key states like New Hampshire, which is an early-voting state and historically has had a good track record selecting the next United States President. 
However, the Granite State's governor does not believe the race in New Hampshire or for the Republican nomination is over. 
On the Rundown earlier this week, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu (R-NH) explained to the Rundown's why he thinks there is plenty of time for President Trump's opponents to catch up. He laid out how they can do so and discussed scenarios where the former President loses. 
Sununu also shared why his state is proud of its first-in-the-nation primary tradition, and why he thinks gerrymandering contributed to the polarization of political parties in the country.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with FOX News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear even more from the outspoken governor and get more of his insights on how politics is broken, but also why he is optimistic about the country's future.

      <title>From Washington: President Biden’s G20 Summit Renew Competency Concerns</title>
      <description>This past week, President Biden traveled to India for the G20 Summit, as he continues his efforts to make inroads into the region and de-escalate tensions between China and Taiwan. While on the trip, multiple blunders from the President have renewed concerns over his mental faculties entering the arduous 2024 election cycle. FOX News Contributor and former Deputy Chief Of Staff for President George W. Bush weighs in on how the President’s missteps have caused establishment Democrats to shy away from the leader. Later Karl discusses how other nations may perceive the United States due to his gaffes and weighs in on the potential for a candidate to come out of the woodwork to primary President Biden.
 
Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not had it easy since claiming his title as House Speaker after a remarkable fifteen rounds of votes and negotiations. Plus, pleasing all parties in Congress has been a challenge regarding issues such as providing relief money for Ukraine, the investigation into President Biden and his son Hunter, and a possible impeachment inquiry all while trying to fund the government on a fast-approaching deadline. Former Utah Congressman and Chair of the Oversight Committee Jason Chaffetz shares his perspective as someone who has seen two different Speakers of the House in the halls of Congress and shares what he thinks Speaker McCarthy can do to control all 435 members.

      <title>Could Hunter Biden (Actually) Face Hard Time?</title>
      <description>Another big bombshell in a political cycle that has already seen many. A grand jury in Delaware returned an indictment against Hunter Biden on three counts connected to making a false statement about drug use during a firearm purchase. The historic indictment comes as part of a broader investigation led by special counsel David Weiss into foreign income and potential tax offenses by Hunter Biden. FOX News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream breaks down the indictment and how it could impact Hunter's father President Joe Biden politically. Bream also weighs in on the impeachment inquiry into the President launched by the House earlier this week.

Former President Trump continues to hold a big polling lead over the GOP field both nationally and in key states. That includes New Hampshire, which historically has had a good track record selecting the next United States President. However the Granite State's governor does not believe the race in New Hampshire or for the Republican nomination is over. On the Rundown, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu (R-NH) explains why he thinks there is plenty of time for President Trump's opponents to catch up and how they can do so. He also shares why his state its first-in-the-nation primary tradition, and why he thinks gerrymandering contributed to polarization of political parties in the country.

Plus, commentary by orthodox rabbi, author, and lawyer Sam Bregman as Jews around the world celebrate the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah.

      <title>Evening Edition: Hunter Biden Indicted On Federal Gun Charges </title>
      <description>President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, has been indicted on federal gun charges stemming from Special Counsel David Weiss' investigation into him. Hunter Biden is charged with making false claims during the purchase of a firearm and the possession of a firearm by someone who is addicted to a controlled substance. The indictment announced Thursday in a Delaware federal court is the first out of David Weiss' probe into Hunter Biden.

FOX's John Saucier speaks with Philip Holloway, former Georgia Prosecutor and the founder of the 'Holloway Law Group', who says Hunter Biden faces serious charges, ones that could have been laid out years ago.

      <title>The Effort to End Human Trafficking</title>
      <description>Yesterday’s House Homeland Security Hearing on migration and the U.S. Border covered one border issue that, despite its severity, is not commonly spoken about. A startling number of migrants being brought across the southern border are being sold into human trafficking by the same cartels or illegal enterprises bringing them to the U.S. With few connections or ways to make money, this has led to many migrants being trapped, and lawmakers like New York Congressman Anthony D’Esposito are determined to find solutions to fight this tragedy. On the Rundown, Rep. D’Esposito discusses how migrants are being trafficked in every state across the U.S., not just those on the border, and why lawmakers must stop “pointing fingers” and instead focus on finding solutions to protect the border. He also speaks about how law enforcement agencies should be supported to ensure they can catch the criminals behind these heinous acts.
An escaped prisoner from Chester County Prison was on the loose in Pennsylvania for nearly two weeks until he was captured by authorities on Wednesday. Convicted murderer, thirty-four-year-old, Danelo Cavalcante was taken into custody shortly after 8 a.m. when an aircraft using thermal technology finally led state police and U.S. Border agents to his location. Former DOJ and FBI Special Agent, Nicole Parker, joins the Rundown to provide details into what mindset the criminal was in when he escaped and break down the behind-the-scenes of how law enforcement finally tracked him down.
Plus, commentary by FOX News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett.

      <title>Evening Edition: FDA Says Widely Used Nasal Decongestant Doesn't Work   </title>
      <description>Earlier this week, advisors to the Federal Drug Administration said phenylephrine, one of the key ingredients in popular over-the-counter nasal decongestants, doesn't really work. Many are concerned that the FDA's findings will cause commercial drugmakers to pull their products from shelves across the country, causing a shortage of cold medicine and changing the landscape of a $2 billion industry.

      <title>The Political Risks Of An Impeachment Inquiry</title>
      <description>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday gave the go-ahead for an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, after facing increased pressure from conservatives in the House. The investigation will focus on whether or not the president benefitted from his son Hunter Biden's foreign business deals, which have been under federal investigation since 2018. GOP Pollster and member of the FOX News National Decision Team Daron Shaw breaks down the political risks that come with this inquiry, how it compares to impeachment fights of the past, and if this latest development opens the door to a serious third-party candidate.
A new gun suspension order has New Mexicans up in arms, as they claim the ruling is a violation of Second Amendment rights. The temporary suspension, put in place by New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham was enacted under an emergency public health order, prompted by the recent fatal shootings of a 13-year-old girl and 11-year-old boy in recent months. Democrats and Republicans have criticized the ruling, claiming the suspension of open and concealed carry laws for Bernalillo County residents will not stop criminals from committing crimes but only prohibits law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves. On the Rundown, New Mexico State Representative John Block (R-51st District) discusses why this order unjustly violates constitutional rights, what complaints he's hearing from both Republicans and Democrats regarding the ruling, and why many believe this action could set back the creation of productive gun control laws.

      <itunes:summary>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday gave the go-ahead for an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, after facing increased pressure from conservatives in the House. The investigation will focus on whether or not the president benefitted from his son Hunter Biden's foreign business deals, which have been under federal investigation since 2018. GOP Pollster and member of the FOX News National Decision Team Daron Shaw breaks down the political risks that come with this inquiry, how it compares to impeachment fights of the past, and if this latest development opens the door to a serious third-party candidate.

      <title>Evening Edition: Thousands Dead In Morocco Earthquake  </title>
      <description>Rescue crews are searching through the rubble of isolated communities in Morocco's Atlas Mountain range after a six point eight magnitude earthquake hit the country last Friday. Nearly three thousand are dead and thousands more are spending cold nights sleeping outside worried about aftershocks. Various countries are offering aid and current help is slow to reach areas because many roads remain inaccessible.  

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with FOX's Trey Yingst, reporting from the village of Talat N'Yaaqoub in the Atlas Mountain region of Morocco, about the scenes on the ground and the current rescue and recovery efforts.

      <title>Why The President Has His Party Worried</title>
      <description>It was a busy week for President Biden, as he attended the G20 Summit in India and met with the Prime Minister of Vietnam in Hanoi. These trips come at a time when many Americans have been raising concerns about the President’s age and ability to serve a second term. After the President was interrupted by White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre during a press conference in Vietnam when he appeared to be trailing off 25 minutes in, many eyebrows continued being raised about the President’s abilities. On the Rundown, FOX News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar joins to discuss recent polls showing both Democrat and Republican voters’ concerns about the President’s age, how his recent public appearances raise questions about his strength as commander-in-chief and the impact this could have on persuadable voters in 2024. 
Yesterday marked 22 years since the attacks of 9/11. As the country held ceremonies to honor the heroes and remember the thousands killed, the mastermind of those attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad and four other terror suspects remained detained at Guantanamo Bay with no trial in sight. With the case in limbo for years, many of the victims' families feel justice is being denied. Former Assistant US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and FOX News Contributor Andy McCarthy, who has prosecuted terrorists in the past, explains why getting to a trial has proven challenging, what a potential plea deal could look like, and whether he thinks the terrorists behind 9/11 will avoid the death penalty.
Plus, commentary by Fox Nation host Tammy Bruce.

      <title>Evening Edition: Court Rules Biden Administration Violated First Amendment Rights Over COVID-19 Content</title>
      <description>A federal appeals court last Friday ruled that the White House, the FBI, the CDC and the Surgeon General could have violated the First Amendment rights of people by moderating content regarding the election, COVID-19 and the handling of Hunter Biden's laptop. The ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans says the governmental agencies pressured technology companies to suppress or even remove posts on those topics. The lawsuit was filed by the states of Missouri and Louisiana, a conservative website owner, and four other people who opposed the administrations COVID-19 policy.

FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Edward Lawrence, White House Correspondent for the FOX Business Network, about the ruling and what it means for free speech.

      <title>Rep. Malliotakis: Migrant Crisis "Will Destroy New York City" If Something Isn't Done.</title>
      <description>Migrants continue flocking to major hubs like New York City despite there being little to no space left to house asylum seekers. The issue has gotten so severe that New York City Mayor Eric Adams claims the migrant surge "will destroy New York City" if they are not given proper funding and resources. As the migrant crisis leads to an estimated $12 billion budget deficit in NYC, many lawmakers are asking what it will take for President Biden to put this issue higher on his priority list. On the Rundown, New York Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis joins to discuss why she believes the mayor's actions have 'incentivized illegal immigration,' as opposed to preventing it and why allowing this is "a slap in the face" to the immigrants in New York City who did follow the legal process to live in the U.S. She also honors those who tragically lost their lives 22 years ago today on September 11th, 2001 and how the heinous attack committed on 9/11 continues impacting members of her community to this day.
The COVID-19 pandemic shined a spotlight on remote education. But now that children have mostly returned to the classroom, schools are finding it increasingly difficult to staff teachers. The problem is so bad in some cases, districts across the country are reaching out to third-party companies to employ remote instructors to educate students from miles away. Susan Moore Johnson, research professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and Evan Erdberg, founder and former president of Proximity Learning Inc. join the Rundown to weigh the pros and cons of remote education and explain why schools are turning to this option more frequently than before. 
Plus, commentary by former FBI Special Agent Nicole Parker.

      <title>Extra: China Is Spying On America More And More. Here's Why It's Hard To Stop It.</title>
      <description>China's spying efforts within our borders have been raising alarms for years. 
Now there are growing number of reports of Chinese citizens posing as tourists and collecting data near and around American military bases. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Defense have reportedly tracked over 100 such incidents of this in recent years, raising red flags that Beijing is using non-traditional means to gather intelligence on U.S. soil. 
Former CIA Chief of Station Dan Hoffman joined the Rundown's Chris Foster to discuss what he calls the "the new Cold War" with China, and what the motives and effectiveness of these cloak-and-dagger operations. 
Hoffman also explained how America counters these spies and what gathers information in countries like Russia and China.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with former CIA Station Chief Dan Hoffman. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll hear our entire conversation that doesn't just include more of his take on America's tensions with China, but also a never before aired portion that includes why Hoffman is now devoting so much of his life to fighting cancer.

      <title>From Washington: The Potential For A President Newsom In 2024?</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/09/10/from-washington-the-potential-for-a-president-newsom-in-2024/</link>
      <description>Poll after poll, shows a majority of voters believe that President Biden is too old for a second term, speculation has been spread that Democrats are working on a backup plan if the President is unable to continue his re-election campaign. An alternative that continues to be named, is California Governor Gavin Newsom. Democratic Strategist, Nationally Syndicated Radio Host, and FOX News Contributor Leslie Marshall weighs in on the traits that Governor Newsom has that would make him a viable alternative to President Biden, why both Democrats and Republicans always have a backup plan in place for candidates, and what it would take for the Governor to get into the 2024 race.

The focus continues to be on the 2024 presidential candidates. But what about Congress? When President Joe Biden took office the Senate was split fifty-fifty causing Vice President Kamala Harris to be the tiebreaker on many vital issues. During the 2022 Midterm Elections, Republicans were looking to win back control, but ultimately did not regain the majority, with Democrats even gaining a seat. Republicans are eager to try again in 2024, with the current Senate map providing many chances for the party to flip seats. The Senate and Governors Editor for The Cook Political Report, Jessica Taylor explains which races she is watching, why the Senate race in Arizona is so hard to predict, and what this means for the party moving forward.

      <description>This week we spoke with Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz about the bipartisan effort to keep AM radio in electric cars as some major EV makers opt to remove the frequency over interference issues.
The fight to save AM radio comes at a time when Democrats are pushing their green agenda which includes incentivizing Americans to drive EVs.

The Texas Republican also weighed in on the growing alliances among US adversaries as Russia's president may be looking for weapons from North Korea.
We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Texas Senator Ted Cruz . On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll our entire conversation that includes more his take on the 'green agenda', and his explanation on how bitcoin, something he is a 'big believer' in, could be help the country cope with its energy problems.

      <title>From Washington: Senate Returns From Summer Recess</title>
      <description>The Senate is back in session, returning to the Capitol Building after its summer recess. However, many were concerned for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) after he froze again during his regular news conference. The Senator vowed to finish his term amid ongoing speculation about the status of his health following two recent episodes. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram asked Senator McConnell directly about his health earlier this week and shares reactions from Capitol Hill. Later, he discusses what's ahead for Congress as they work to prevent a government shutdown.

The federal budget deficit totaled $2.3 trillion dollars, almost twice the amount from last year, a projection coming from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Committee's Senior Vice President and Policy Director Marc Goldwein points out why people should care about the national debt, explains what it means for money in Americans' wallets, and details what kind of legislation Congress should pass to relieve some of our country's debt.

      <title>Federal Prosecutors Seek To Indict Hunter Biden By End Of Month</title>
      <description>Federal prosecutors announced they will seek an indictment of Hunter Biden by the end of September. Many believed the President's son would put a stop to his legal woes last month as he intended to take a plea deal for his misdemeanor tax charges and enter a diversion program for a separate felony gun charge. However, the plea agreement fell apart when a judge questioned several aspects of the deal, sending his legal team back to the drawing board. Nevertheless, Hunter may finally have his day in court, with U.S. special counsel David Weiss seeking a federal indictment. FOX News Sunday Anchor, Shannon Bream, joins the Rundown to break down the developments in the case, discuss President Biden's trip to India, and preview her interview with Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) this Sunday.
Months ago, a jury found Alex Murdaugh guilty of two counts of murder for the nationally covered killings of his wife and son. On Tuesday, Alex Murdaugh's lawyers filed a motion for a new trial, citing compelling evidence of jury tampering in which the Colleton County clerk told the jury "not to believe a word Murdaugh says." Anchor of The Story, Martha MacCallum, sat down for an exclusive interview with Alex's son, Buster Murdaugh, who shared his suspicions about the conviction of his father. Martha joins the podcast to share her analysis of Buster's unique perspective, including whether he believes his father is guilty, her thoughts on the likelihood Murdaugh will receive a retrial, and more about her new FOX Nation special, 'The Fall of the House of Murdaugh'.
Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.
Plus, commentary from host of OutKick's Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Evening Edition: Mayor Eric Adams Warns Migrant Crisis "Will Destroy New York City"</title>
      <description>The migrant crisis "will destroy New York City." That's what New York City Mayor Eric Adams told residents at a town hall on Wednesday. Sanctuary cities like NYC have been receiving an estimated 10,000 migrants a month, causing a strain on resources, with education being the resource most under focus this week. New Yorkers sent their students back to school today, along with upwards of 20,000 migrant children now eligible to attend the city's schools. Fox Business Correspondent Madison Alworth joins FOX's Eben Brown to explain how city funds are being stretched thin by the migrant influx, the issues of language barriers and vaccinations that new migrant students present, and the tension between blue city mayors and the Biden administration when it comes to resources to help migrants.

      <title>Sen. Cruz Wants To Slam The Brakes On President Biden’s Green Agenda</title>
      <description>As Democrats push their green energy policy goals, there has been a push for Americans to switch to electric vehicles. A new concern from Washington about electric vehicles is that many car manufacturers are contemplating removing AM radios from their electric cars and trucks. Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic Senator Ed Markey are urging lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to join them in supporting 'The AM for Every Vehicle Act,' to ensure that over 80 million American users still have access to this technology. Senator Cruz (R-TX) joins the Rundown to discuss where Republicans and Democrats differ and align on electric vehicles and why he believes it's essential that AM radio remains a reliable source in natural disasters. He also shares why growing alliances among U.S. adversaries pose a serious threat that the Biden administration must confront.

As kids head back to school, COVID-19 cases continue to rise throughout the United States, prompting many districts to implement pandemic-era precautions to get ahead of the spread. Students from kindergarten through college are now being required to mask up yet again, with COVID-related hospitalizations appearing more frequently. On the Rundown, FOX News Medical Contributor and Professor at Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Marty Makary, breaks down the latest regarding booster vaccines, why the method of tracking wastewater is a better indicator of a potential spike, and what new research suggests about the efficiency of masks as a preventative tool.

Plus, commentary by columnist David Marcus.

Meanwhile, Secretary of State Blinken arrived in Kyiv this week with news that the U.S. would deliver a one-billion-dollar aid package for their defense efforts. FOX News Chief National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin joins to explain what kind of significant munitions America will be giving Ukraine, what impact the death of Wagner Group's chief Prigozhin will have in the long run, and positive signs Cuba is pushing back against Russia's human trafficking scheme.

      <title>China's Alarming Cloak-And-Dagger Espionage Campaign In America</title>
      <description>First, there were spy balloons flying over the United States. Now, Chinese citizens posing as tourists are spying on American military bases. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Defense have reportedly tracked over 100 incidents of this in recent years, raising red flags that Beijing is using non-traditional means to gather intelligence on U.S. soil. However, many spies walk away with trespassing charges rather than espionage. As threats continue to rise, Congress is looking to enact legislation on the issue, but the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, says the allegations are ill-intentioned. Former CIA Chief of Station Dan Hoffman joins the Rundown to explain "the new Cold War" with China, why Xi Jinping is trying to control battlespace across the world, and the national security risks of American military intelligence falling into the wrong hands.

Police staffing shortages have become a very real problem, not just in America’s big cities but in small towns as well. In the middle of August, the entire police department in Goodhue, Minnesota, resigned, citing a lack of fair compensation and the burden of a scarce supply of new officers. Police departments across the nation have been grappling with a critical staffing shortage, as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ data shows a consistent decline in law enforcement jobs starting in 2020. Whether it be Los Angeles, Austin, Philadelphia, or a small town in the Midwest, all communities are experiencing difficulty attracting police officers. But why is this? Goodhue, Minnesota’s Sheriff Marty Kelly joins to break down what led to the disbanding of his town’s police department, the critical obstacles stations face during police recruitment, and what needs to change to bring people back to the profession of law enforcement.

      <title>GOP Stars Are Rising, But Who Will Democrats Look To After Biden?</title>
      <description>Plenty of focus is on the GOP presidential primary race, while President Biden has had very few campaign events for his 2024 presidential race. Only two candidates, neither holding elected office, have challenged the President for the Democratic nomination, but due to their low poll numbers, he will all but certainly remain his party’s nominee. But who is President Biden’s heir apparent in 2028? FOX News Radio political analyst Josh Kraushaar joins the Rundown to explain how 2024 is shaping up for both parties, which Democrats appear to be waiting in the wings for their shot at commander in chief in 2028, and how key political moments can make or break would-be candidates and create future stars in the political parties.
 
For the first time since Chinese President Xi Jinping came into power in 2012, he will not attend this year’s annual G20 Summit in India. Though reports say China still plans to send their No. 2 leader, Premier Li Qiang — Jinping’s absence has raised eyebrows across the globe. Why would he miss out on representing China at one of the most influential gatherings of the year? Some wonder if the growth of India, where the Summit will be this year, and their growing relationship with the West may have led to China “rebuffing” the host country. Others voice concerns about what this could mean for the nation’s already fragile relationship with one of our top adversaries. On the Rundown, FOX’s Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent Greg Palkot joins Alex Hogan to discuss what messages he believes the Chinese President is sending via his absence, how this reflects America’s “frosty” relations with the country, and how concerned world leaders should be that China seems to be distancing itself from the other members of the G20.

On the Rundown, FOX’s Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent Greg Palkot joins Alex Hogan to discuss what messages he believes the Chinese President is sending via his absence, how this reflects America’s “frosty” relations with the country, and how concerned world leaders should be that China seems to be distancing itself from the other members of the G20.</p><p> </p><p>Plus, commentary from co-host of Fox &amp; Friends Weekend and Host of ‘The Will Cain Podcast’ Will Cain.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Rep. Gonzales On Representing 800 Miles of the Border As Migrant Surge Continues</title>
      <description>Surges of migrants continue coming to the U.S.-Mexico border in hopes of entry, leading to what many deem an ongoing border crisis, as border patrol agents struggle to control the border with limited resources &amp; a surplus of immigrants coming daily. This has impacted every state in America, as critics claim a loose border allows for deadly drugs like fentanyl to make their way to the U.S. while large groups of migrants overwhelm small border towns and take buses or planes to sanctuary cities that have now run out of space. One district particularly impacted is Texas’ 23rd district — which makes up 800 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. On the Rundown, Congressman Tony Gonzales, who represents this district, joins to discuss how the border crisis continues impacting his constituents, why it’s up to Republican lawmakers in Congress to craft border legislation as the Biden administration neglects to do so, and what pathway he believes should be available to migrants wanting to enter the U.S. that is safe and efficient.
The August jobs report released on Friday bodes well for the U.S. economy, with the Labor Department reporting 187,000 jobs added. Unemployment changed unexpectedly, however, increasing to 3.8 percent, which is the highest jobless rate since February 2022. This marks one of the biggest jumps in unemployment since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Co-host of The Big Money Show on FOX Business Brian Brenberg joins the Rundown to break down the current state of the economy, explain why the rising unemployment rate can have positive impacts down the road, and explain why many companies are grappling with a hybrid-work model to save on spending.
Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of “Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla.”

      <title>Extra: Aging Politicians' Health Scares "Sparking Really Difficult Conversations In D.C."</title>
      <description>Earlier this year, Democrats were having a discussion about Senator Diane Feinstein's fitness for office at her advanced age. This past week, after Senator Mitch McConnell's second instance of freezing in a press conference, Republicans were forced to have similar talks.
These conversations are coming amid a difficult time in Washington and the country. Florida is recovering from Hurricane Idalia, and in Maui recently, a community was devastated by wildfires.
FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream joined to discuss all these topics and more.
Due to time limitations, we could not include our entire conversations in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the complete interview with Shannon Bream.

      <title>From Washington: A Government Shutdown on the Horizon?</title>
      <description>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy appeared on Fox News last week, signaling an impeachment inquiry may be coming for President Biden. This follows a months-long trend, with various Republican lawmakers calling for accountability and further investigation into the President and his family’s business and foreign business dealings. Even as the GOP teases possible impeachment, the President will still have to work with Congress to approve a federal budget by the end of September or face a government shutdown. Fox News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram explains how Speaker McCarthy has tested the water for impeachment and what’s in jeopardy of being cut from federal spending as a government shutdown looms.
For decades China has been purchasing portions of the United States' debt, ultimately earning the title of the largest foreign owner of U.S. Treasury securities. However, they forfeited their status after decreasing their holdings by more than nine percent, just under one trillion dollars. As tensions between the two countries continue to grow, many are concerned about the consequences of owing China money. President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Maya MacGuineas explains the national security risks posed by foreign entities buying up American debt and why China's economic turmoil has impacted their decision to pull back.

      <title>Extra: In The Aftermath of Hurricane Idalia, How Do FEMA &amp; Florida Work Together?</title>
      <description>Hurricane Idalia touched down in Florida this past week. Heavy rains, storm surges, and intense winds left communities in the Sunshine State with flooded homes without power and, in some cases, clean water.
President Biden and Governor Ron DeSantis have been collaborating to get Floridians the resources they need. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is always front-and-center in situations like these and is now aiding folks affected by the natural disaster.
Former FEMA administrator Brock Long has dealt with these disasters in the past. He joined for an interview to break down what FEMA is doing right now to help, what the biggest concerns are in the aftermath of a hurricane, and the need for the agency's political neutrality to help all Americans in crisis.

      <title>From Washington: DeSantis's Balancing Act Between Hurricane Idalia &amp; A Presidential Campaign</title>
      <description>Governor Ron DeSantis is the only sitting governor who has already qualified for the second Republican Primary Debate in the 2024 Presidential Election. Despite falling 37 points behind former President Donald Trump in the most recent FOX News Poll, Floridians seem to approve of his ability to manage his state during the Category 4 Hurricane Idalia. Gerald L. Baliles Professor and Director of Presidential Studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center Barbara Perry explains how the governor's management of Florida can possibly boost his numbers for the Republican primary and help him stand out on the campaign trail.

After a lengthy pause due to the pandemic and a lost fight in the Supreme Court, student loan payments begin next month. Despite the loss, the Biden Administration refuses to give up on providing borrowers with relief through various initiatives and legislation, such as the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan and. President and Founder of Mitlin Financial Lawrence Sprung explains what impact federal involvement will have on borrowers and what students can expect as their pause is finally over.

      <title>Shannon Bream: Moments Of Crisis, Spending Bills &amp; Aging Politicians</title>
      <description>President Biden and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis may be political adversaries, but they’ve spent a great deal of time on the phone in recent days coordinating the disaster response to Hurricane Idalia. For the Biden administration, they are grappling with handling this disaster after receiving mixed public opinion on their response to last month’s deadly wildfire in Hawaii. Meanwhile, in Washington, the age of politicians is under scrutiny again after Senator McConnell appeared to freeze again in a press conference. FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to explain how the disaster response efforts will demonstrate leaders’ ability to lead in a crisis, how NY Governor Kathy Hochul is pressing the Biden administration for resources as migrants overwhelm them, and how the McConnell situation has furthered concerns about aging politicians' fitness for office.

Federal marijuana restrictions may soon be easing. The Department of Health and Human Services signaled this on Wednesday, issuing a new recommendation to reclassify the drug in the lower-risk category of Schedule III rather than its current status as a Schedule I drug. This move follows the political and social trend of legalization we have seen throughout the country in the past decade, with 23 states legalizing the drug for recreational use. The new recommendation will be reviewed by the DEA, but advocates have long pushed for this classification shift that would bolster the growing cannabis industry. Former FBI supervisory special agent Lance Leising explains what this means from a law enforcement perspective and how it sets the stage for national cannabis decriminalization down the road.

Plus, commentary by FOX News contributor Deroy Murdock.

      <title>Gov. Youngkin Talks Strengthening Education: "Children Belong To Parents, Not States"</title>
      <description>School districts across the U.S. are debating what policies to adopt when handling students who request to change their name or gender identity at school. Should parents be informed if their children make a request of this nature, or should it stay between the teacher and student due to potential safety concerns at home? Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, who has long advocated for parents' rights, has issued a new model policy that aims for schools to partner alongside parents, ensuring parents are in the know and able to make decisions concerning their children. The Governor joins the Rundown to discuss this plan in depth and how he's continuing to prioritize bettering education in his state. Later, he explains how he's working to give government money back to Virginians and why early voting could be crucial to securing a Republican victory come election season.

Florida is no stranger to hurricanes, and the most recent storm is wreaking havoc across the Sunshine State. Wreckage, debris, and downed power lines now litter Florida as Hurricane Idalia made landfall Wednesday morning as a Category 3 storm. Nearly thirty counties were evacuated, and over 200,000 homes have lost power. Former FEMA Administrator Brock Long joins the Rundown to break down FEMA's role during the disaster response, what kind of leadership is needed in the aftermath of the storm, and why putting aside politics during a natural disaster provides a better outcome for the affected residents.

Plus, commentary from the host of OutKick’s Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Two Years Since US Withdrawal From Afghanistan: Recounting "Regret" &amp; "Inevitable Chaos"</title>
      <description>Wednesday marks two years since the end of the Biden administration's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, which resulted in the deaths of thirteen U.S. service members. Their deaths at the hands of a suicide bomber at Abbey Gate in Kabul marked a tragic end to the nation’s largest evacuation effort in U.S. history, officially ending two decades of war. Since then, the Biden administration has faced questions of accountability surrounding the withdrawal, with the Gold Star families of those service members who lost their lives speaking to lawmakers earlier this month. FOX's Chief National Security Correspondent, Jennifer Griffin, joins the Rundown to evaluate what went wrong and what military officials plan to do moving forward.

The Biden administration unveiled on Tuesday the first 10 drugs they will set for Medicare price negotiations. In Washington, lowering the price of prescription drugs everyday people depend on to survive has been a priority. However, the White House’s plan is not without its critics. So how will this actually impact Americans’ wallets and medicine cabinets? Deputy Assistant to the President for Health and Veterans Affairs Christen Linke Young joins the podcast to break down the administration’s plan to lower drug prices, how the pharmaceutical industry’s development of new drugs could be negatively impacted, and when Medicare users will really see these prices drop.

Plus, commentary by Fox News Medical Contributor and author of "Panic Attack," Dr. Nicole Saphier.

Since then, the Biden administration has faced questions of accountability surrounding the withdrawal, with the Gold Star families of those service members who lost their lives speaking to lawmakers earlier this month. FOX's Chief National Security Correspondent, Jennifer Griffin, joins the Rundown to evaluate what went wrong and what military officials plan to do moving forward.</p><p><br></p><p>The Biden administration unveiled on Tuesday the first 10 drugs they will set for Medicare price negotiations. In Washington, lowering the price of prescription drugs everyday people depend on to survive has been a priority. However, the White House’s plan is not without its critics.

Deputy Assistant to the President for Health and Veterans Affairs Christen Linke Young joins the podcast to break down the administration’s plan to lower drug prices, how the pharmaceutical industry’s development of new drugs could be negatively impacted, and when Medicare users will really see these prices drop.</p><p><br></p><p>Plus, commentary by Fox News Medical Contributor and author of "Panic Attack," Dr. Nicole Saphier.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Governor Burgum Says “Divisiveness Sells.” But He’s Not Buying It</title>
      <description>North Dakota Governor Doug Burgam remains an underdog in the 2024 Republican presidential race; however, after his first debate performance, his campaign is confident he’ll be attending the second debate too, despite not yet qualifying. While some candidates dominated the stage and combatted rivals with fierce language, Governor Burgum spoke for only seven and a half minutes during the two-hour debate. He focused his energy and criticism on President Joe Biden instead of taking shots at his fellow GOP candidates. On the Rundown, Governor Burgum explains his strategy for the next debate, his plan to protect the U.S. from an increasingly hostile China, and shares how he injured himself ahead of the debate.

Several sanctuary cities across the U.S. face an unsettling reality: they no longer have enough housing for migrants. This influx has led Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City to resort to turning hotels, churches, or apartment complexes into migrant housing, yet these cities and their surrounding communities are still overwhelmed. So how will these cities find solutions with insufficient funding, a lack of physical space, and concerns from residents? On the Rundown, Rockland County Executive Ed Day discusses how the migrant surge in New York City has impacted his community for months and why he is willing to do "whatever he has to do" to stop Mayor Eric Adams from allowing more migrants into the city. Later, Chicago Alderman Raymond Lopez shares how his city is suffering and potential solutions to the inundation of migrants.

Plus, commentary by Executive Director and General Counsel for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, Robert Henneke.

      <title>Rep. McCaul Talks Wagner Boss’ Suspicious Death &amp; 2-Year Anniversary of Afghanistan Exit</title>
      <description>Russian officials have confirmed that the chief of the Russian Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was among the ten people killed in a plane crash last week. This comes two months after Prigozhin led an insurrection against Russian President Vladimir Putin, leading many to believe it was an intentional hit by Putin, despite the Kremlin claiming otherwise. This week in the U.S., Americans honor the two-year anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the attack at the airport in Kabul that led to the death of 13 service members. The Gold Star families who lost loved ones continue calling for transparency &amp; accountability from the White House, as many never learned how their loved ones passed or why the withdrawal ended in tragedy. On the Rundown, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) explains how he is working with families to gain clarity &amp; ensure similar disasters can be avoided. He also shares his thoughts on the fatal plane crash and why the claim that Prigozhin’s death was accidental is “laughable.”

Cancer diagnoses among young Americans are on the rise. Many recent studies have found that for people under the age of 50, the rate of cancer diagnoses is going up, and despite zeroing in on this concerning trend, doctors are struggling to figure out why this is happening. One study looked at cancer diagnoses between 2010 and 2019 and found that people are approximately 15 percent more likely to be diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancers than they were a decade ago, thus making it the fastest-growing type of cancer amongst young people. FOX News Medical Contributor and Professor at NYU Langone Health, Dr. Marc Siegel, joins the Rundown to discuss possible causes for the spike, encourage Americans to start screening for cancer at a young age, and analyze the future of cancer treatment.

Plus, commentary by Fox Nation host Tammy Bruce.

      <title>Extra: Why The U.S. Must Beat China In The Latest Moon Race</title>
      <description>Over 50 years after Americans walked on the moon for the first time, the U.S. finds itself in a new modern space race. 

Several countries are now eagerly trying to land on the dark side of the moon in an effort to one day tap its resources. 

Just this week, India became the fourth nation on Thursday to successfully land on the moon. That was just days after Russia's first lunar mission in nearly five decades failed. 

Former NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine joined Chris Foster earlier this week, just before India' historic success, to discuss why there is an urgency to land on the south pole of the moon and why the water, and minerals there matter so much.

Bridenstine explained how establishing bases near and on the moon could benefit private businesses and be a launching pad to future Mars missions. Bridenstine also explained why the he fears China will establish a moon base first and why it's important the government takes the new moon race very seriously. 

We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Former NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll our entire conversation about why the modern moon race is so critical to America's future.

      <title>From Washington: The Odds Of A September Government Shutdown</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/08/27/from-washington-the-odds-of-a-september-government-shutdown/</link>
      <description>As summer winds down and America's children head back to school, Congress has a major assignment awaiting them when they return from their August recess. Washington lawmakers will have to race to pass various appropriation bills in order to avoid a government shutdown. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram joins to discuss the hurdles that face Congress upon their return, why House Speaker Kevin McCarthy may be reluctant to work with Democrats on the legislation, and how a potential impeachment inquiry into President Biden factors into the negotiation process. 

As the United States continues to suffer from drug shortages, many Americans are struggling to fill prescriptions for antibiotics and even some cancer treatments. The reason we’re experiencing this is because many of our country's pharmaceuticals or their active ingredients are produced overseas.  There is a growing effort by some Washington lawmakers to bring production back home and help America become less reliant on countries like China. Eric Edwards, cofounder and CEO of Phlow, a pharmaceutical company based in Richmond, Virginia, joins to discuss the importance of manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients domestically and why Congress should push harder for reform.

      <title>Extra: The Debate Over Decriminalizing Prostitution</title>
      <description>Several states in America are rethinking prostitution. Or at least how to address those who are involved in it. 

For example, Maine's Governor Janet Mills recently signed a bill that will no longer make it a crime - for at least the adult offering sexual services. However, It would still be illegal to buy sex or be a pimp.

And in New York state, lawmakers are also weighing a bill that would decriminalize 'sex work'.  

Not surprisingly, these bills have reignited the debate over how best local and state governments should address the 'world's oldest profession' and those whose lives are negatively affected by it. 

Earlier this month, New York Republican State Senator Anthony Palombo and Vice President of the National Center of Sexual Exploitation Eleanor Gaetan joined the FOX News Rundown's Lisa Brady to discuss the pros and cons of legalizing, decriminalizing, or over prosecuting prostitution. 

Both guests had concerns for the safety of sex trafficking victims, but had different ideas on how best to help them and address the other crimes and social problems associated with the sex trade business. 

We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversation with Congressman New York Republican State Senator Anthony Palombo and Vice President of the National Center of Sexual Exploitation Eleanor Gaetan. On today's FOX News Rundown Extra, you'll our entire conversation about this complex issues.

      <title>From Washington: Looking Ahead To The Second GOP Debate</title>
      <description>On Wednesday night, eight Republican candidates made their case as to why they should be the next president. With the next debate just weeks away, what adjustments must the candidates make in order to gain traction and catch up to the GOP frontrunner former President Donald Trump? President of KAConsulting, former Senior Counselor to President Trump and FOX News Contributor Kellyanne Conway shares which moments from Wednesday's debate stuck out to her the most and discusses what voters must do to keep their campaigns alive.
For the fifth consecutive year, the United States Department of Defense failed an audit. This comes as Congress is considering a topline defense spending total of nearly 900 billion dollars. President of Citizens Against Government Waste Thomas Schatz speculates as to where our defense spending is going, debates whether past Presidents have any stake in the blame for this issue, and reminds listeners that just because other agencies have passed audits does not mean their systems are economically sound.

      <title>Candidates "Go For The Jugular." Could It Shift The Political Landscape?</title>
      <description>With the first 2024 Republican presidential debate behind us, the question that remains is: has the political landscape shifted? The GOP contenders traded barbs in Milwaukee, and many have singled out former Governor Nikki Haley and tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for memorable appearances, but now it is up to American voters to react with fundraising dollars and polling. Meanwhile, on Thursday night, former President Trump turned himself in at an Atlanta jail for his RICO indictment in the Georgia election interference case. FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to unpack the candidates' debate performances and stark division on key issues such as Ukraine funding, abortion, and the economy.
Almost five months after his arrest, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich finds himself serving even more time behind bars. On Thursday, a Moscow court announced the American journalist's pre-trial detention had been extended for a second time, forcing him to stay in one of Russia's most brutal prisons until at least the end of November. Gershkovich was originally arrested in March for espionage, which both the WSJ and the Biden administration vehemently deny. Wall Street Journal Washington bureau chief Paul Beckett joins the Rundown to discuss the possibility of the country participating in yet another prisoner swap, how Gershkovich is staying in touch with the U.S., and the pattern of hostility he is seeing from the Russian government.
Plus, commentary by former Congressman Jason Chaffetz, host of the Jason in the House podcast.

      <title>First GOP Debate Recap: Which Candidates Fired Shots While Others Fell Flat?</title>
      <description>The air was tense last night in Milwaukee, following the first 2024 Republican presidential debate that set the tone for a fiery race between GOP presidential candidates that is likely to only heat up from here. While there were stand-out performances and memorable one-liners from many on the stage, particularly from some who had fallen behind in the polls like former Vice President Mike Pence and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, there were also candidates with a lot to prove that left voters unimpressed. To break it all down, Fox News Audio Political Anchor Jared Halpern and Fox News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar join live from Milwaukee to discuss who fought the hardest to be heard, which candidates faced the harshest backlash, and how big of an impact this debate could have on the election.

Policies regarding students' gender identities are a main focus this back-to-school season in New Jersey, as several districts are trying to enact new mandates requiring teachers and staff to notify parents if their child wishes to change their gender identity, pronouns, or use different bathrooms. On Friday, a New Jersey judge temporarily blocked this rule, saying it would violate discrimination laws and hurt transgender students. Some parents in the Garden State, on the other hand, are pushing for this policy to become the norm, arguing it violates parental rights. Attorney and legal analyst Mercedes Colwin joins the Rundown to break down why parents feel this violates the 14th Amendment and why this case has the power to reach the Supreme Court.
 
Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of "Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla."

      <title>Showdown In Milwaukee: A Preview Of The First GOP Presidential Debate</title>
      <description>Tonight, Americans will witness the first 2024 Republican presidential debate, hosted by the Fox News Channel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Eight candidates have qualified for the debate stage: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, former Vice President Mike Pence, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, Senator Tim Scott, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, North Dakota Governor Doug Bergum, and former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson. Former Wisconsin governor and 2016 GOP candidate Scott Walker joins the Rundown to give debate advice to the candidates, explain what issues will be important to Wisconsinites, and give his prediction of who on the debate stage will stand out from the crowded 2024 field.

Former President Donald Trump continues to be favored as the frontrunner in the GOP primary race, but he will not be participating in tonight's debate. His absence gives Ron DeSantis the potential to increase his favorability among MAGA Republicans, as he currently polls at 16 percent in the recent Fox News poll. Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will share center stage with the Governor, and many see the political novice as a target, although he continues to climb the polls. FOX News Decision Desk Director Arnon Mishkin joins the Rundown to evaluate each candidate’s standing ahead of the debate, break down why Governor DeSantis' campaign is slowing down, and how lesser-known candidates must use the debate to stay in the race.

Plus, commentary from the host of OutKick’s Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Evening Edition: Ukraine Calls For Confidence In Their Counteroffensive  </title>
      <description>Despite some Western intelligence agencies saying the Ukrainian Military's counteroffensive against the Russian invaders has come to a stalemate, Ukrainian officials say they are defying the odds by making any advancements. Ukraine will now be getting over forty F-16's, a weapon Kyiv has been asking for since the invasion happened. FOX's Jennifer Griffin speaks with Yuriy Sak, advisor to Ukraine’s Defense minister, who says he assures the world that Ukrainian forces are making advancements and acknowledges aid from the West has been key.

      <title>Is The Debate Make-Or-Break For Desantis?</title>
      <description>The focus may be on Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in Wednesday's GOP primary debate in Milwaukee. Former President Trump has announced his intention to not appear at any of the primary debates, despite being the frontrunner in the Republican primary race. DeSantis recently came under media fire for calling MAGA lawmakers, “listless vessels.” While this line drew criticism, DeSantis is resonating with voters on the campaign trail, with a recent Des Moines Register poll showing him with the highest favorability of any candidate. Desantis 2024 National Spokeswoman Carly Atchison joins the Rundown to explain Governor DeSantis’ plan as he heads into FOX’s debate night, why the campaign believes it is a two-man race between DeSantis and Donald Trump, and what DeSantis would do for Americans on day one of his presidency.

Ever wondered what the dark side of the Moon looks like? Several countries are now in an international race to get there first. Russia's first moon mission in nearly five decades recently failed, but more nations are conducting expeditions soon, with India’s spacecraft set for a moon landing on Thursday. The water found in this uncharted area could be used for rocket fuel, making the Moon a connecting point between Earth and Mars. However, the U.S. fears that if China gets there first, it will claim the land for itself and make it impossible for other countries to benefit from the scientific advancements. Former NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine joins the Rundown to explain why the Moon's resources are so valuable and why competing countries must be civil and non-hostile while on the Moon.

Plus, commentary from FOX News Contributor Joe Concha.

      <title>Evening Edition: Navy Officer Remains Imprisoned In Ally Japan  </title>
      <description>Navy Lieutenant Ridge Alkonis is currently serving a three year prison sentence in Japan for his involvement in a car accident that resulted in the deaths of two people. Family and friends of Lt. Alkonis say he is being forgotten about and want to see more done by the government and the military to seek his release. FOX's Ryan Schmelz speaks with Andrew Eubanks, long time friend of Lt. Alkonis and advocate for 'Bring Ridge Home', who says a medical condition caused the accident and much more should be done by officials to return Lt. Alkonis to his family.

      <title>Why The GOP Debate Will Be All About Who Can Sway Swing Voters</title>
      <description>Candidates making up the crowded 2024 GOP field have a crucial opportunity to set themselves apart and gain favor from voters during this week's debate -- but how will they do so? Will they go after former President Donald Trump, regardless of whether he makes an appearance, or focus more on convincing voters why they must get President Joe Biden out of the White House, offering a more hopeful view of the future? Though both have been common strategies, only time will tell which will attract the widest range of voters, leading some Republican candidates to shine while others fall further back into the shadows. To break it all down, former White House speechwriter and Fox News Contributor Marc Thiessen joins the Rundown to discuss why winning over independent &amp; swing voters could be key to securing the nomination, how President Trump's legal battles could work both against him and in his favor simultaneously, and his predictions on which candidates could end up surprising viewers most during Wednesday's debate.
Hundreds of school districts across the country are adopting a four-day school week, causing celebration from students and teachers, yet many parents are concerned with how the new schedule will affect their child's education. Some schools are opting to adjust operating hours as a way to entice teachers to combat the growing teacher shortage, yet research shows that the reduced instruction time may have consequences for students and will cost districts roughly the same. Associate Professor of Economics at Oregon State University, Paul Thompson, joins the Rundown to debunk assumptions associated with the change, describe how a four-day week will hurt working parents, and explain how this adds to post-pandemic learning loss.

Plus, commentary by a former investment banker and author of 'You Will Own Nothing,' Carol Roth.

      <title>Extra: Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary, "Never Bet Against America"</title>
      <description>Can the U.S. get inflation under control? Another rate hike decision is coming for the Fed, and while core inflation is decreasing, officials believe the economy will need to cool further or else inflation may be sticking around.
The Biden administration has been touting the nation's economic successes, but the latest Fox News poll shows eight in ten Americans rate the economy either "fair" or poor," and more than half believe the President has made it worse.
Chairman of O'Leary Ventures and Shark Tank star and investor Kevin O'Leary is an expert on all things business, and he joined the Rundown to break down our economy's chances of a soft landing.
Due to time limitations, we could not include all of the interview in our original segment. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear our entire interview with Kevin O'Leary about America avoiding a recession, how hybrid work created a crisis in commercial real estate, and how controversial PR moves can cost companies millions.

      <title>From Washington: Republicans Weigh First Debate Strategy</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/08/20/from-washington-republicans-weigh-first-debate-strategy/</link>
      <description>FOX News Channel hosts the first Republican Primary Debate of the 2024 election cycle on Wednesday, August 23rd, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The candidates are preparing for a stage that may or may not have the former President and leading Republican candidate, Donald Trump participating. Director of the FOX News Poll and member of the FOX News Decision Desk Daron Shaw discusses the history of Presidential primaries, how each candidate is shaping up in the Republican field, and explains why debate strategy may not change whether or not former President Trump attends.
 
How old is too old? Lawmakers in the United States are starting to work well beyond retirement age. With politicians like Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) recently suffering from health scares, it poses the question of when lawmakers should hang up their hats. If elected for a second term, President Joe Biden will be 82 years old on inauguration day, causing voters to become apprehensive about his cognitive abilities. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram examines why some are not eager to step down from their positions and why it is perfectly reasonable for voters to question their leaders' mental capabilities.

      <title>From Washington: President Biden Hosts Historic Summit At Camp David</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/08/19/from-washington-president-biden-hosts-historic-summit-at-camp-david/</link>
      <description>On Friday, President Biden hosted South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at Camp David to strengthen the United States' relationship with the countries while deterring China's influence. The two leaders put aside historical grievances to establish military cooperation with the U.S. amid growing tensions with China and North Korea. FOX News White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich provides a recap of the summit and discusses the policy and commitments made by the three leaders.

Historic wildfires continue to sweep across Hawaii's third most populated island, Maui, resulting in over one hundred casualties. As rescue efforts continue, locals are criticizing the state's lawmakers for not utilizing its emergency sirens to notify residents about the blaze. President Joe Biden will visit the Island state on Monday, after facing increased pressure to do so as he made very few remarks about the catastrophe, despite signing a federal disaster declaration last week. Former Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency Craig Fugate joins to discuss how visiting the island too early will do more harm than good and how the flames will impact Hawaii's pre-existing housing crisis.

      <title>Evening Edition: Maui Emergency Manager Resigns Amid Response Criticisms  </title>
      <description>Maui's administrator of emergency management announced his resignation just a day after defending the decision not to sound alarms when the deadly wild fires broke out. Meanwhile, more than one thousand people remain unaccounted for as search crews have combed nearly sixty percent the devastated town of Lahaina looking for remains of victims. FOX's Tonya J. Powers speaks with Robert Ray, FOX Weather correspondent on the ground in Maui, about the ongoing search for victims of the fire and reaction by residents to the official's resignation.

      <title>Iowa Governor: GOP Race Is "Far From Over"</title>
      <description>Despite the former President's large lead in the GO primary polls so far, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds believes her state’s first-in-the-nation voting process is still “absolutely wide open.” Contenders in the race like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy have some of the many candidates shaking hands on the ground in Iowa, convincing voters they have the best vision for the Republican party. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds joins the Rundown from the Iowa State Fair to share why her state is a key indicator of who will do well in the general election and explain why she is a fierce proponent of school choice.

The White House continues to praise their progress on the U.S. economy however Fox polling shows most Americans remain pessimistic about the nation’s financial trajectory. So, while costs have come down on many items, core inflation remains high and key sectors like real estate are struggling, resulting in consequences for many Americans’ portfolios and 401Ks. Chairman of O'Leary Ventures and Shark Tank star and investor, Kevin O’Leary joins the podcast to explain why forecasts of a soft landing for the U.S. economy may be interrupted by rate hikes, how Target repeated Bud Light’s alienating PR moves, and how work-from-home and hybrid work created a crisis in commercial real estate.
 
Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.
 
Plus, commentary by Will Cain, host of “The Will Cain Podcast”

      <title>Evening Edition: Hunter Biden's Lead Attorney Withdraws From Case   </title>
      <description>Hunter Biden's lead attorney Christopher Clark has asked to withdraw from the Justice Department probe into the president's son because he says he may eventually become a witness in future proceedings in the case. Taking Clark's position is high-profile D.C. attorney Abbe Lowell who is said to want to move more towards a publicly combative approach. FOX's Ryan Schmelz speaks with David Spunt, Washington D.C. correspondent for FOX, about Hunter Biden's new attorney and what it means for his case.

      <title>The Iowa State Fair: Traditions, Tractor Pulls, And President Trump</title>
      <description>Republican presidential hopefuls have been hitting the ground in Iowa this week, as they fight to make a name for themselves before the caucus voters this January. The recently released FOX News Power Rankings show former President Donald Trump remains the GOP frontrunner, with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott trailing behind him. The Iowa State Fair has long served as a proving ground for presidential candidates to introduce themselves to primary voters and shake up the race. FOX News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to share why voters in Iowa look forward to getting to know their options, Trump's legal woes, and why he continues to dominate the polls.

Last week, disaster struck in Hawaii resulting in the deadliest wildfires in American history. Now, the Maui community of Lahaina has been almost entirely destroyed by the blaze. The emergency response to this crisis from the federal government has been criticized as slow however local Hawaiians are banding together to help take care of their own. Lahaina resident and co-founder of Great Forest Ministry Non-Profit, Ryan Valliere had his home decimated by the wildfires but with the help of his ministry he is working to get those in the community necessary funds to survive. On the podcast, he discusses the harrowing experience, what his organization is doing to help, and his hopes for Lahaina to rise from the ashes.

Plus, commentary by former Congressman Jason Chaffetz, host of the Jason in the House podcast.

      <title>Big Questions Remain With GOP Debate Just A Week Away</title>
      <description>As Americans gear up for the first Republican Presidential primary debate, an important question remains: Will former President Donald Trump take the debate stage? As he manages four indictments, the former President has yet to signal if he’ll be making an appearance in Milwaukee alongside the other seven Republican presidential candidates vying for the nomination — but his presence, or lack thereof, could have significant impacts on how the debate plays out. Fox News Chief Political Anchor Bret Baier, who’s preparing to host the debate alongside Fox News’ Martha MacCallum, joins the Rundown to discuss where he believes former President Trump’s head may be regarding his appearance, how his attendance will likely shape what topics will be top of mind for the other GOP candidates, and what other issues are expected to come up in Milwaukee next week.
Some candidates are still struggling to qualify for the first Republican primary debate, with just one week to turn things around. Former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson (R-AR) has met the polling requirements, but not the fundraising criteria of 40,000 donors. Governor Hutchinson joins the Rundown to discuss how he still expects to make the stage in Milwaukee next Wednesday, and why he thinks voters are looking for an alternative to both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.

Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of “Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla.”

      <title>What's So Special About A Special Counsel?</title>
      <description>Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Friday that he was appointing a special counsel to further the investigation into Hunter Biden; however, who he chose to lead the charge left many raising eyebrows. David Weiss, a principal figure in the Hunter Biden case, will be conducting the probe, though due to his past involvement in the investigation and the role he played in negotiating Hunter's "sweetheart" plea deal, many Republicans have criticized this move. Attorney Sol Wisenberg, who served as former Deputy Independent Counsel in the Whitewater and President Clinton investigations, joins the Rundown to discuss why he does not support Weiss leading the special counsel due to his previous actions in the investigation, the likelihood of Hunter Biden facing an indictment, and why President Biden himself could also face special counsel in the future.

Five Americans in custody in Iran may soon have a chance at freedom, as the United States is negotiating a tentative deal for their release, but it is not without its drawbacks. In return, Iran wants the U.S. to approve the release of nearly $6 billion in assets frozen by American sanctions. Additionally, Iran would receive some Iranians imprisoned in America as well. This deal would come at a time in which many national security experts in the nation are wary of Iran’s ambitions for nuclear power, and some warn that approving the unfreezing of assets would be akin to paying ransom to Tehran. FOX News Chief National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin has spoken to the families of those imprisoned and government sources who are negotiating for these Americans’ freedom. She joins the podcast to break down the terms of the deal and the dangerous precedent it may set.

Plus, commentary by Fox Nation host Tammy Bruce.

      <description>Its been five days since wildfires swept through the western side of the island of Maui and now it is reported that nearly one hundred lives have been lost.

      <title>As Iowa Takes Center Stage, Which Candidates Are Shining?</title>
      <description>As China remains a prominent threat, families continue to face economic woes, and President Biden’s approval ratings keep dropping in the polls, it has become clear that many Americans may be ready for a change of leadership in 2024. As many Republican candidates step up to hopefully become the party’s next presidential nominee, they must first take a trip on the campaign trail to attract voters. One of their first, and most important, stops is Iowa — and as many GOP candidates make their way across the state to meet voters, it’s already becoming evident which candidates are standing out &amp; who may be falling behind. On the Rundown, Congresswoman Ashley Hinson (R-IA) discusses the first impressions candidates have been making on her constituents &amp; what qualities Iowans want in a President. She also discusses how the Chinese Communist Party is targeting America’s food security as they attempt to steal seeds &amp; agricultural technology in her state and why she believes ‘Bidenomics’ is a “complete &amp; total sham” as she continues seeing families’ struggle.
 
Engaging in prostitution will soon no longer be a crime in Maine, becoming the first state to partially decriminalize it with one major caveat: it will still be illegal to buy sex. Now in New York, state lawmakers are also weighing a bill that would go even further with full decriminalization, but it has reignited debate over whether this is a step in the right direction. New York Republican State Senator Anthony Palombo and Vice President of the National Center of Sexual Exploitation Eleanor Gaetan join the podcast to explain what action the government should be taking and why full decriminalization could do more harm than good for sex trafficking victims.

      <title>Extra: Why China’s Rare Earth Dominance Is A National Security Threat</title>
      <description>The push for electric cars, and even wind and solar energy requires critical minerals like Lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite.
Rare earth elements are essential for both common items we already on, but for technology we may be reliant on in the future. 
America has access to some of these key resources, but China continues to dominate the critical mineral market.
After serving as the Governor of Texas, Rick Perry served as the Energy Secretary during the Trump administration. 
Sec. Perry joined host Jessica Rosenthal recently on the FOX News Rundown: From Washington podcast to discuss the importance of these minerals and the need for American to be the leader in the market.
He also discussed not just the need for more mining in America, but why becoming energy independent is critical to the country's success and security.
Due to time limitations, we could not include our entire conversations in the FOX News Rundown: From Washington segment that ran last week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the complete interview with former Texas Governor and former Energy Secretary Rick Perry about why certain minerals are so critical to our country and why America must stand up to China's attempt to control them.

      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/08/13/from-washington-if-not-president-biden-then-who/</link>
      <description>President Biden turns 81 this November and many pundits are raising concerns over his age and ability to govern. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Marianne Williamson have already thrown their names in the ring as potential contenders against the sitting President, with many Democrat insiders passing around California Governor Gavin Newsom as a viable alternative. Co-Host of The Five, and Democratic Strategist Jessica Tarlov joins to discuss the possibilities she sees for a legitimate contender to rise up against President Biden, how having former President Trump as the Republican nominee would impact the 2024 Election, and why she believes it is fair for voters to question the President's abilities given his age.
 
While Congress continues its August recess, the Senate will have a significant hurdle to jump once they return in September when approving hundreds of military promotions. One senator has been the gatekeeper in holding up the Senate approvals, Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville. Senator Tuberville has vehemently denied any promotions due to his opposition to a Pentagon policy of paying for a military service member's travel to get an abortion, which he believes is in direct violation of the Hyde Amendment. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram joins as he lays out the procedure of approving the military appointees, how the Senate may find a workaround to get the service members approved, and weighs in on why Senator Tuberville is choosing this issue to make a political stand.

      <title>Extra: Americans Are Losing Trust In The U.S. Military. Why?</title>
      <description>Americans' confidence in the military is at its lowest level in over two decades. 
Military recruitment has been suffering as well, with the Army, Air Force, and Navy each expecting to fall short of their recruitment goals this year.
These troubling trends come at a time of growing tensions with China grow, as well as increased instability in multiple regions around the world. 
Earlier this week, FOX News Correspondent Alex Hogan spoke with Florida Republican Congressman Michael Waltz on the FOX News Rundown about both the recruitment problem and why he says Americans are losing trust in the U.S. military.
The former Green Beret discussed his perspective, what he thought pentagon officials and lawmakers could to do to strengthen the U.S. armed services at a time it is facing what he calls the "greatest threats" in America's history 
Congressman Waltz also reacted to a congressional forum held earlier this week where several Gold Star families -- who lost loved ones during America's 2021 exit from Afghanistan - called for accountability and shared their pain and disappointment.

      <title>From Washington: Presidential Hopefuls Flock To Iowa State Fair</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/08/12/from-washington-presidential-hopefuls-flock-to-iowa-state-fair/</link>
      <description>This weekend, Republican presidential candidates made their way to the Hawkeye State for the annual Iowa State Fair. Although many candidates seized the opportunity to sit down with Governor Kim Reynolds for a 'Fairside Chat' to share their platform with voters, former President Trump declined a sit down with her. Other candidates such as Miami Mayor Francis Suarez are using the event as a way to garner more support ahead of the first presidential debate later this month. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) discusses how the candidates' campaigns have evolved over the months and explain the importance of winning over voters in the first caucus state.
President Biden signed an executive order this past week that will limit American investments in Chinese technology. The Biden Administration believes that the order will stifle China from enriching its military with the use of the United States' dollars, and promote domestic advancement in the fields of semiconductor manufacturing and advanced computing. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) joins to discuss the impacts the executive order may have on foreign relations with China, the government's role in regulating private corporations, and how China may react to the policy decision.

      <title>Could A Judge Soon ‘Censor’ President Trump?</title>
      <description>The judge presiding over the special counsel’s case against former President Trump has a big decision looming—whether or not a protective order will be issued in this case, which will determine what evidence can be publicly shared. Special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecutorial team requested this, arguing that ‘the case must be tried in a courtroom, not in the media.’ Trump and his legal team, on the other hand, argue that this is ‘an assault on his First Amendment rights’ and would silence the former President on the 2024 campaign trail. On the Rundown, FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream explains the dispute about a potential protective order that would stop former President Trump from publicly sharing evidence, the unprecedented circumstances of the case, and why state battles over abortion rights have only just begun.

Shoplifting videos have recently been going viral, displaying groups of thieves storming stores or boldfaced shoppers stealing expensive items in broad daylight. In the era of social media, it seems like shoplifting has become somewhat of a trend, leaving stores in major cities across America hurting. Despite many locking up merchandise or putting sensors on items, the problem remains one of increasing importance. So why has retail theft become so prominent in the U.S., and what can retailers do to stop it? Gerald Storch, the founder and CEO of Storch Advisors, joins the FOX News Rundown to discuss how factors like social media and organized crime are contributing to rises in retail theft. He shares why companies are losing customers due to theft reduction methods and his thoughts on retail employees being punished, or even fired, for attempting to stop shoplifters.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary from the host of OutKick’s Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>What The Hunter Biden Bank Docs Reveal</title>
      <description>The House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer released a memo detailing evidence of the Biden family’s foreign business dealings, including redacted bank records which the GOP claims will reveal millions of dollars in payment to Hunter Biden from Russian and Kazakhstani oligarchs. House Oversight says they believe they can tie the folks contributing millions to Hunter’s businesses abroad to President Biden himself. Congressman Pat Fallon (R-TX) argues there is a concerning pattern with Hunter Biden’s business dealings and says he believes eventually the evidence will uncover a massive political scandal. On the Rundown, Rep. Fallon explains what Hunter Biden’s bank documents reveal, the Democrats’ response to them, and the continued search for a smoking gun in this investigation.

Earlier this week, voters in an Ohio special election rejected a measure that would have made it more difficult to change the state's constitution. The current system required a simple majority to make amendments; however, the defeated GOP-backed measure had proposed raising the threshold to a 60 percent supermajority. Many pundits and pro-choice activists warned that if passed, this would severely curtail Ohioans' ability to pass the abortion rights amendment scheduled for a state ballot initiative in November. While the vote is still months away, this sets the stage for Ohio voters to codify abortion rights. On the podcast, Kyle Kondik, Managing Editor at Sabato’s Crystal Ball, breaks down why this special election was indirectly a vote on abortion rights, why this Republican-backed measure was defeated, and how this will affect Ohioans on the November ballot.

Plus, commentary by former FBI Special Agent Nicole Parker.

      <title>Evening Edition: D.C. Councilman Suggests Using The National Guard To Fight Crime</title>
      <description>In a passionate press conference alongside residents who said they are scared, D.C. Councilman Trayon White suggested it may be time to call in the National Guard to fight a rising number of violent crimes in the city. More than a dozen people have been killed in our nation's capital since the beginning of the month along with skyrocketing number of car jackings. FOX's Ryan Schmelz speaks with Rich Edson, Fox's Senior National Correspondent and Washington D.C. resident, about this idea and whether or not the National Guard could be used to combat crime.

      <title>"A Complete National Security Crisis": Cartels, Smugglers and The Border Surge</title>
      <description>Border crossings slowed down this past spring after the United States prepared for a surge following the end of Title 42. However, the numbers are on the rise again this summer, climbing nearly 30% in July. Texas Governor Gregg Abbott (R-TX) has taken matters into his own hands by installing a floating border made up of buoys and razor wire along the Rio Grande in an effort to stop migrants from wading through the water. The Justice Department is suing Texas over this citing that it violates the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899. FOX News National Correspondent, Bill Melugin, takes the Rundown to the southern border to discuss cartel members caught on camera entering the U.S. and why migrant numbers are rising again, even in the excessive heat.
Americans' confidence in the military is at its lowest level in over two decades. Military recruitment has been suffering as well, with the Army, Air Force, and Navy each expecting to fall short of their recruitment goals. The Afghanistan withdrawal that saw 13 U.S. service members lose their lives was an event that shook public faith in the military, and this week Congressman Darrell Issa held a congressional forum with the Gold Star families who lost loved ones in this chaotic withdrawal, where they demanded accountability from the Biden administration. Florida Congressman Michael Walz is a retired Green Beret colonel of the U.S. Special Forces, and he joins the Rundown to explain how the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal has hurt confidence in the military, why military recruitment has hit a record low in the U.S., and how America should work to combat Russian and Chinese aggression.
Plus, commentary by country music star, Lee Greenwood.

Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference earlier this week said, "There is no more room."

      <title>The GOP Field Is Playing Catch Up</title>
      <description>In poll after poll, the majority of voters say they do not want a Biden-Trump rematch in 2024; however, the beginning stages of the campaign suggest that is what Americans may be in for. Despite the deep bench of qualified Republicans, former President Trump continues to command the GOP primary race and mainstream news cycle with his latest indictment. Meanwhile, President Biden has continued touring the U.S., touting his economic accomplishments that the White House has branded ‘Bidenomics.’ Co-director of the Fox News Poll and professor at the University of Texas at Austin, Daron Shaw, joins the Rundown to explain what lanes exist for GOP primary candidates as the former President maintains strong support, how the Hunter Biden situation could threaten President Biden’s favorability advantage in the election, and how social issues are throwing a wrench in 2024 campaigns.

Following the pandemic and the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Americans have been feeling pain at the pump, with gas prices reaching record highs. However, there are new factors contributing to the ever-frequent price hikes, like the summer's extreme heat waves, which caused refinery breakdowns and equipment failures. On the Rundown, Phil Flynn, an oil trader and FOX Business Network contributor, discusses why the Biden administration's release of barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was only a short-term solution, why electric vehicles aren't a realistic option for working-class Americans, and shares why people think the rise in prices is unexpected due to the Department of Energy underreporting oil demand for the past six months.

Plus, commentary by Fox &amp; Friends co-host and host of The Brian Kilmeade Show, Brian Kilmeade.

      <title>House GOP Whip Talks New Biden Family Bombshells &amp; “Bidenomics”</title>
      <description>Here is the blurb that will be posted with the FOX News Rundown podcast for AUGUST 7, 2023:
The Biden family continues living in the headlines, as new developments regarding Hunter Biden’s business dealings and the unveiling of the President’s new economic philosophy, “Bidenomics,” continue being top news across the country. Though President Biden is aiming to keep Americans focused on his economic vision, many are unable to forget the record inflation, high interest rates, and unsteady housing market they’ve faced for months on end. Additionally, a new testimony from Devon Archer, a former business partner of Hunter Biden, before the House Oversight Committee has revealed evidence suggesting that President Biden was aware of and potentially involved in multiple foreign business deals his son Hunter was making. On the Rundown, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) shares why he believes “Bidenomics” is failing as it isn’t “resonating with mainstream America,” how Devon Archer’s testimony further reveals ‘corruption’ within the Biden family and his reaction to a new CNN poll that reveals the majority of Americans trust House Republicans to tackle major issues over the President.
People calling 9-1-1 for urgent help are seeing massive delays in actual assistance. A new survey released by the National Emergency Number Association shows that over 80 percent of America’s dispatching centers are understaffed. This is causing record levels of employee burnout and churn, as staff feel unprepared to deal with certain high-stress situations. Nearly all of the call centers in the country provide mental health services to their employees; however, respondents are not taking advantage of the resources made available to them. CEO of the National Emergency Number Association, Biran Fontes, joins the Rundown to talk about why many respondents struggle to handle the stress of the job, how better technology could improve job performance, and the association’s efforts to work with the U.S. Labor Department to provide better resources to dispatchers.
Plus, commentary by the Executive Director of Fight for Schools and author of “Parents of the World, Unite!” Ian Prior.

        <![CDATA[<p>Here is the blurb that will be posted with the FOX News Rundown podcast for <strong>AUGUST 7, 2023:</strong></p><p>The Biden family continues living in the headlines, as new developments regarding Hunter Biden’s business dealings and the unveiling of the President’s new economic philosophy, “Bidenomics,” continue being top news across the country. Though President Biden is aiming to keep Americans focused on his economic vision, many are unable to forget the record inflation, high interest rates, and unsteady housing market they’ve faced for months on end. Additionally, a new testimony from Devon Archer, a former business partner of Hunter Biden, before the House Oversight Committee has revealed evidence suggesting that President Biden was aware of and potentially involved in multiple foreign business deals his son Hunter was making. On the Rundown, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) shares why he believes “Bidenomics” is failing as it isn’t “resonating with mainstream America,” how Devon Archer’s testimony further reveals ‘corruption’ within the Biden family and his reaction to a new CNN poll that reveals the majority of Americans trust House Republicans to tackle major issues over the President.</p><p>People calling 9-1-1 for urgent help are seeing massive delays in actual assistance. A new survey released by the National Emergency Number Association shows that over 80 percent of America’s dispatching centers are understaffed. This is causing record levels of employee burnout and churn, as staff feel unprepared to deal with certain high-stress situations. Nearly all of the call centers in the country provide mental health services to their employees; however, respondents are not taking advantage of the resources made available to them. CEO of the National Emergency Number Association, Biran Fontes, joins the Rundown to talk about why many respondents struggle to handle the stress of the job, how better technology could improve job performance, and the association’s efforts to work with the U.S. Labor Department to provide better resources to dispatchers.</p><p>Plus, commentary by the Executive Director of Fight for Schools and author of “Parents of the World, Unite!” Ian Prior.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Extra: Rep. Jim Jordan On The "Biden Brand" And A Possible Impeachment</title>
      <description>The Hunter Biden drama continues for the White House and the Biden 2024 campaign.
The president's son pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor tax evasion charges last week. 
Then, days later, Biden's former business associate, Devon Archer, testified behind closed doors in front of the House Oversight Committee. 
Archer told them Hunter would routinely put his father on the phone to introduce him to foreign business partners and prospective investors. While Archer claimed Hunter was there to promote the 'Biden Brand', he also said the then-Vice President never discussed business on those phone calls. 
House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) attended the testimony and spoke to the FOX News Rundown's Dave Anthony about what he heard, and why he has serious problems with how the DOJ has been handling the Hunter Biden investigation. 
Rep. Jordan explained why he's troubled by Joe Biden's actions and what it would it take to move forward with impeachment.
The Ohio Congress also discussed how tech companies and the government not only censored information related to Hunter Biden, but also tried to silence conservatives during the pandemic who spoke out about COVID policies and theories that differed from health officials. 
Due to time limitations, we could not include our entire conversations in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the complete interview with House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) and hear more of his take on the Hunter Biden probe and what he calls the 'weaponization' of the government.

      <title> From Washington: Congress On Recess As Government Shutdown Looms</title>
      <description>The clock is ticking on a September 30th deadline for Congress to finish the appropriations process and fund the government. The House began its August recess with only passing one of 12 appropriations bills. They will only have a few weeks to fund the government after they return on September 12th. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram joins to explain how Congress is divided on these bills, and why there is a good chance that a government shutdown may be inevitable. Chad also touches upon the testimony of Hunter Biden business associate Devon Archer, and how House Republicans may use the power of the purse to cut funding to the Department of Justice.
﻿In an effort to expand mental health care options, last month the Biden administration enacted changes to the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. The moves include advancing access to services in Medicare, expanding the 9-8-8 suicide hotline, and adding additional mental health services in school. The White House hopes their actions will allow patients to receive specialized care without paperwork barriers and make sure there are enough insurance providers willing to pay for care. Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council for Health and Veterans, Christen Linke Young, joins to explain why mental health care access is essential to the overall health of the nation and would greatly benefit underserved communities.

      <title>Extra: Is Our Democracy In A 'Perilous place'?</title>
      <description>Former President Donald Trump entered a Washington, D.C. federal court this Thursday and pleaded not guilty to four criminal charges related to January 6th and his attempt to overthrow the 2020 presidential election.
Trump called it, 'a sad day for America.'
A major presidential candidate has never before faced so many legal troubles. But despite being arraigned three times in the last four months, and another indictment from Georgia likely coming, Trump remains the clear GOP frontrunner in the 2024 presidential race.
But the question remains if Trump can maintain his lead in the polls as he navigates court dates and could even potentially go to jail before election day.
Former White House Press Secretary and FOX News Contributor Ari Fleischer joined the Rundown's Dave Anthony earlier this week to discuss former President Trump's legal problems and what he called 'uncharted territory" for America.
Fleischer explained how these cases will impact the 2024 election, why the charges are only fueling Trump's supporters, and why the uncertainty of what could happen in the coming months puts our democracy in a 'perilous place'.
Due to time limitations, we could not include our entire conversations in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the complete interview with Former White House Press Secretary and FOX News Contributor Ari Fleischer and get more of his take on this past week's historic news and why the 2024 race will be a test to America's democracy.

      <title>From Washington: President Trump Indicted Again. An Insider's Take On A Historic Week</title>
      <description>President Trump was indicted Tuesday by Special Counsel Jack Smith on charges related to January 6th and his attempt to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. On Thursday, the former President pleaded not guilty to the four felony counts in a Washington, D.C. federal court. FOX News Justice Department Producer Jake Gibson watched the historic arraignment inside the courtroom. He discusses how the events of the day unfolded. Later, he explains the possible penalties the former President could face and the next steps in the prosecution.
The critical minerals market has seen unprecedented growth, despite the world race to transition to clean energy. Former Energy Secretary and former Governor of Texas Rick Perry emphasizes the need for these minerals, such as lithium and cobalt, which are essential components for electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines, and solar panels. He later explains that if the U.S. were to completely remove fossil fuels from by 2030, it would not only be devastating to the American economy, but also countries around the world.

      <title>Shannon Bream On the Biden “Brand” &amp; Trump Indictments</title>
      <description>Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden's youngest son, has been subject to a federal investigation since 2018 for his foreign business practices. After pleading not guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges last month, Devon Archer, Biden's former business partner, told congressional investigators that Hunter would tout the Biden 'brand’ and often have then-Vice President Biden speak on business phone calls. However, Archer's testimony contradicts that of the White House, which claims the President was never involved in any of his son's business deals. On the Rundown, FOX News Sunday Anchor, Shannon Bream, talks about how Hunter Biden was able to sell his family's name and status, what former President Trump's third indictment means for the 2024 election, and why many Americans are losing confidence in President Biden.
Two decades of research and experimentation may have created a "cancer-killing pill" that some medical experts see as potentially the biggest game changer for the future of cancer treatments. Linda Malkas is a professor of molecular diagnostics and experimental therapeutics and has been working on this drug at the cancer treatment and research facility, City of Hope. She has named the drug, AOH1996, after 9-year-old cancer patient Anna Oliva Healey, who died in 2005. Healey’s parents asked Malkas if there was anything she could find a cure for their daughter’s cancer, and since then she has worked tirelessly in Anna’s honor to save others like her. Linda Malkas Ph.D. joins the podcast to discuss how the drug works to target certain proteins to exclusively eliminate cancerous cells, how Anna served as her inspiration for the drug’s development, and the bright future of this cancer treatment.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary from host of OutKick’s Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>2024 Race Enters “Uncharted Territory”</title>
      <description>Former President Donald Trump continues to make history as he faces a third federal indictment, this time on charges to overturn the results of the 2020 election and the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Experts are saying the latest criminal counts are the most severe yet. Juggling several different criminal cases is a difficult task, especially for someone campaigning for a second term in the White House. Former White House Press Secretary and FOX News Contributor Ari Fleischer joins the Rundown to explain how these cases will impact the 2024 election, why the charges are only fueling Trump's supporters, and why being absent from primary debates may set a bad precedent for future candidates.

The 106,000 overdose deaths due to opioids in 2021 were outpaced in 2022; dangerous fentanyl and other black-market drugs threaten to kill a record number of Americans in 2023 if this trend is not addressed. The White House says they are accelerating their efforts to combat overdose deaths and fentanyl being trafficked into the country. Dr. Rahul Gupta is the head of the Biden administration's Office of National Drug Control Policy, and he says they have launched new programs to crack down on the illegal spread of opioids from the border and to expand Americans' access to an over-the-counter nasal spray to save potential overdose victims. Dr. Gupta joins the Rundown to explain why the White House's reinvigorated efforts to fight the opioid crisis will be effective and what must be done about all the fentanyl that is already in the U.S.

Plus, commentary from former California State Assemblyman and vice president of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, Chuck DeVore.

      <title>President Trump’s Third Indictment: What To Know</title>
      <description>Former President Donald Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury for his role in the January 6th riot at the Capitol and efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This is the third criminal indictment the former President is facing, being charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of &amp; attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. Law Professor at the University of California at Berkeley and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General, John Yoo, joins the Rundown to explain why this most recent indictment is “by far the most important” in regards to public interest, how difficult it will be for each of the cases against him to be proven in court, and how the former President’s upcoming trials will undoubtedly interfere with the 2024 presidential election.
Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor tax evasion charges last week. Biden’s former business associate, Devon Archer, told oversight committee members that Hunter would routinely introduce his father to foreign business partners and prospective investors. As the case progresses, three GOP chairmen, including House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH), Oversight Chair James Comer (R-KY), and Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-O), have sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding documents and information regarding circumstances related to Hunter Biden’s plea deal with the Justice Department. Congressman Jordan (R-OH) joins the Rundown to discuss why he thinks the DOJ continues to change its story, how he would move forward in impeaching President Biden, and break down the ways the Biden administration has tried to censor the American people.
Plus, commentary from Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow specializing in environmental policy, Ben Lieberman.

      <title>Evening Edition: Secret Chinese Lab Housed Modified Mice With COVID  </title>
      <description>Officials from various levels and agencies of government are still trying to make sense of an underground biolab uncovered in rural California. The biolab run by a Chinese biotech firm, purportedly made COVID-19 and pregnancy tests and authorities also found lab mice that “were genetically engineered to catch and carry the COVID-19 virus.” FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Gordon Chang, U.S.-China relations expert and author of 'The Great US-China Tech War', about this strange find and what it means to national security.

      <title>Jack Smith's Biggest Challenge Convicting President Trump</title>
      <description>On Monday, a Mar-a-Lago employee made his first court appearance in Miami, Florida, after being accused of carrying out orders from the former president to destroy security footage. The former President stands accused of attempting to hide this from investigators looking into his mishandling of classified documents. The estate's property manager, Carlos De Oliveira, is the second Trump employee named in the case, alongside Walt Nauta, Trump's long-time valet, who is facing charges for allegedly moving boxes full of classified documents at least five times. FOX News Contributor and law professor at George Washington University, Jonathan Turley, joins the Rundown to discuss how the new charges will impact the case as it moves forward, what would happen if the trial were pushed to after the election, and why Trump would be unable to pardon himself if elected to a second term.

President Biden has been touting 'Bidenomics' as a success, as inflation has been decreasing and unemployment is low. Despite the positive direction of the economy, there is a feeling of disconnect among the American people, with the latest Fox News Poll showing 45 percent of people believe the nation is falling behind economically. Co-anchor of "The Big Money Show" on FOX Business, Taylor Riggs, joins the podcast to explain why financial pessimism still persists for many citizens and what exactly economists mean when they predict a soft landing for the economy. Later, she breaks down how younger generations' spending and lifestyle habits could impact the country's future and how union strikes may inflict a wage price spiral on consumers.

Plus, commentary by Fox Nation host Tammy Bruce.

      <title>Opioid Crisis Continues: A New 'Zombie Drug' Getting Laced Into Fentanyl</title>
      <description>A new Narcan-resistant drug is being mixed into the already dangerous synthetic opioid fentanyl. The CDC has been tracking the concerning trend and found that xylazine, or "tranq," has become increasingly common in overdose deaths across the United States. In fact, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, this animal tranquilizer with grotesque side effects is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced. New York City Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan joins to explain why xylazine overdose victims are often nearly impossible to save, how the sedative emerged as such a prominent threat, and what solutions government authorities should be looking at to stop the rapid spread of this drug.

Many fear that with the rise of e-commerce and the continued expansion of big-box retailers, mom-and-pop shops across America will cease to exist as people become reliant on the Internet for all their needs. Both Walmart and Amazon have grown to become household names with same-day delivery and affordable prices. However, both retail giants are trying to break into each other's sphere by dabbling with the other's key strategy. Longtime business journalist and the author of 'Winner Sells All,' Jason Del Rey joins the Rundown to discuss standout strategies small businesses can adopt to remain competitive in the changing industry, how malls are redesigning themselves to draw in more revenue, and the biggest takeaways from his new book.
 
Plus, commentary by Democratic strategist and former Biden campaign surrogate, Kevin Walling.

      <title>Extra: Police Officer Turned Congressman On The Fight To Better Fund Law Enforcement</title>
      <description>Ever since the death of George Floyd in May of 2020, policing has been in the spotlight, and there have been calls for the profession to change its practices and policies.
But Republicans and Democrats remain far apart on police reform, with conservatives pushing for more police funding while Democrats have advocated for increased officer accountability.
The increased scrutiny of law enforcement across the country has had an impact. Last year, police departments across the country reported officers resigning in unprecedented numbers, creating widespread vacancies and recruitment issues that spiraled into a major public safety concern.
Before Congressman Pete Stauber (R-MN) was on Capitol Hill, he was a police officer laying his life on the line to protect his community. With a unique perspective as a former law enforcement officer and now legislator, Rep. Stauber recently joined the Rundown’s Lisa Brady to discuss the state of his old profession and how best to address America’s crime crisis.
Due to time limitations, we could not include our entire conversations in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the complete interview with former police officer Congressman Pete Stauber.

      <title>From Washington: How HHS Failed to Protect Migrant Children</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/07/30/from-washington-how-hhs-failed-to-protect-migrant-children/</link>
      <description>Earlier this week the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing to investigate the exploitation of migrant children and the oversight of the Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. The ORR claims they act in the best interest of the minors however, The New York Times reported last year horrific child labor conditions. The Chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Congressman Tom McClintock (R-CA) joins to evaluate the outcome of this week's hearing, discuss the allegations of abuse, and explain how the United States got caught up in a worldwide child trafficking operation.
Congress had a big week, wrapping up voting and hearings before the scheduled August recess. The Senate passed its own version of the National Defense Authorization Act, which is expected to face pushback by House Republicans, and the House Oversight and Accountability subcommittee heard testimony from whistleblowers, alleging the government has knowledge and evidence of extraterrestrial life. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram shares what was revealed during the House Oversight hearing and discusses the likelihood of a government shutdown when Congress returns in September.

      <title>Extra: Heat Waves Across The U.S. What's Behind This Scorching Summer?</title>
      <description>Heat waves are being recorded all across the United States. Record-breaking temperatures have many cities on high alert, with most issuing heat warnings that the weather outside “feels like” temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. What’s behind this scorching summer?
The Rundown’s Dave Anthony caught up with Bjorn Lomborg, President of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, to get insight on why these heat waves have become so frequent for regions across the globe. 
He breaks down the impact global warming is having on average temperatures and provides potential solutions for cities to cool down. Later, he explains why a rapid switch to green energy will only hurt America’s poorest and how technical innovation may be the key to combating climate change.
Due to time limitations, we could not include our entire conversations in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the complete interview with the author of ‘False Alarm,’ Bjorn Lomborg.

      <itunes:summary>Heat waves are being recorded all across the United States. Record-breaking temperatures have many cities on high alert, with most issuing heat warnings that the weather outside “feels like” temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. What’s behind this scorching summer?
The Rundown’s Dave Anthony caught up with Bjorn Lomborg, President of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, to get insight on why these heat waves have become so frequent for regions across the globe. 
He breaks down the impact global warming is having on average temperatures and provides potential solutions for cities to cool down. Later, he explains why a rapid switch to green energy will only hurt America’s poorest and how technical innovation may be the key to combating climate change.
Due to time limitations, we could not include our entire conversations in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the complete interview with the author of ‘False Alarm,’ Bjorn Lomborg.

      <title>From Washington: NSC Coordinator John Kirby Weighs National Security Threats</title>
      <description>Despite no major breakthrough in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, the Biden Administration announced that it would be sending a $400 million aid package to Ukraine consisting of munitions, missiles, and drones. Meanwhile, there have been limited communications from North Korea regarding the condition of Army Private Travis King, a soldier who crossed into the country without authorization last week. White House National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby discusses the current state of Russia's war in Ukraine, the ongoing diplomatic efforts to bring Private King home, as well as his takeaways from this week's Congressional hearing on UFOs.

As the first Republican presidential debate nears, candidates are working to energize voters in an effort to make the stage on August 23rd. So far, seven candidates have met the necessary qualifications to make it to the debate stage. However, former Vice President Mike Pence has struggled to meet the necessary donor threshold. Meanwhile, although the current frontrunner has met the qualifications, whether or not former President Trump will participate in the first debate is still up in the air. FOX News Decision Desk Director Arnon Mishkin discusses the lineup listeners can expect at the debate, what candidates' fundraising abilities say about their viability, and how the former President's legal situation could play a role in his decision to attend the debate.

      <title>Evening Edition: Russia's Long History Of Oppressing Ukraine  </title>
      <description>Russia has a long-established history of brutality and abuse of Ukraine, from the time of the Czars to the formation of the Soviet Union. From that same difficult past, there are many falsely justified reasons for Russia's current invasion and war on Ukraine. FOX's Alex Hogan speaks with Mikhail Zygar, a Russian-born journalist and author of 'War and Punishment: Putin, Zelenskyy, and the Path to Russia's Invasion of Ukraine', about the history between Ukraine and Russia, how it has influenced the war, and how the past has been falsified by Moscow.

      <title>GOP Floats Biden Impeachment. Will It Fly With Voters?</title>
      <description>House Republicans are now floating the idea of impeaching President Joe Biden over unproven claims of financial misconduct. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy first made the comments on Tuesday at the Capitol, where he stated the committees would continue their investigations. An impeachment probe could possibly throw a wrench into the 2024 election because such an investigation could take as long or as little time as the House chooses. FOX News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream joins the Rundown to talk about why an impeachment during every administration sets a bad precedent, explains why Hunter Biden's plea deal was put on hold, and why Florida Governor Ron DeSantis needs to hit the campaign trail in certain states in order to boost his polling numbers.

Recently, the United States has experienced record-breaking temperatures this summer, with some cities reaching an excruciatingly high 118 degrees. Because of the high temperatures, Americans are struggling to find ways to stay cool. With an increase in heat-trapping gasses lingering in the atmosphere, many believe climate change is to blame. President of the Copenhagen Consensus Center and visiting fellow at the Hoover Institute, Bjorn Lomborg, joins the Rundown to provide possible ways for cities to cool down, share why he thinks eradicating fossil fuels is completely unrealistic, and explain why combating climate change begins with innovation.

Plus, commentary by former White House and Pentagon official, Doug MacKinnon.

      <description>Today marks the 70th anniversary of the armistice that ceased the Korean War but tensions obviously still remain between the two countries, and those tensions have recently risen. Meanwhile, the fate of U.S. soldier Travis King, who seemingly defected into North Korea, remains unknown. FOX's Eben Brown speaks with Rep. Young Kim (R-CA) about current situation for King, her reflections on the anniversary of the end of the Korean War and the current political temperature of the Korean Peninsula.

      <title>Judge Delivers Bad News For The Biden Family</title>
      <description>The President’s son, Hunter Biden, pleaded not guilty to tax charges after the judge in his case refused to accept the plea agreement, citing concerns about the constitutionality of the immunity the deal would have granted Hunter Biden. The judge deferred the decision, unraveling this deal in federal court and surprising both sides. Before this, Republicans had criticized the plea bargain as a "sweetheart deal," displaying political favoritism. The White House and DOJ are refuting accusations of meddling in the Hunter Biden investigations. On the Rundown, Anchor of The Story on FNC and host of The Untold Story podcast Martha MacCallum joins to discuss what may come next for the President and his son in this legal battle, how the collapse of this plea deal occurred, and what political consequences may be coming for the Biden administration.

Vice President Kamala Harris condemned the Florida State Board of Education’s new guidelines to teach the state’s public schools that slaves developed skills that personally benefited them. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was among the first of many to say Harris and other Democrats’ characterization of the new standards were ‘a clear misrepresentation.’ Gov. DeSantis fired back, explaining that the new teaching standards were created with the help of African American scholars. Florida Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. joins the podcast to explain why he and Florida parents are standing behind these new guidelines and why those who helped create the curriculum strongly disagree with the Democratic critiques.

Plus, commentary by former Congressman Jason Chaffetz, host of the Jason in the House podcast.

      <title>Hunter Biden Heads To Court</title>
      <description>President Joe Biden's youngest son, Hunter Biden, is expected to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of tax evasion on Wednesday in Wilmington, Delaware. Hunter Biden has been the subject of a federal investigation since 2018 for his foreign business practices, and Republican lawmakers argue that the Department of Justice has given the president's son special treatment during the investigation. One example they point to is the fact that Hunter Biden has already reached a pretrial agreement for a felony gun charge for possessing a firearm while addicted to drugs. On the Rundown, Andrew McCarthy, FOX News Contributor and former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, explains why Hunter Biden wasn't charged with a felony, shares why he thinks the President's son received preferential treatment, and compares the investigation to the Hillary Clinton email scandal.

 
Artificial intelligence has grown increasingly popular as Americans incorporate programs like ChatGPT and facial recognition into their everyday lives. AI uses are countless, and law enforcement is using the tool as well. Police are finding new ways to utilize artificial intelligence and facial recognition for "predictive policing," which uses AI to analyze crime patterns, police body camera footage, and surveillance footage to predict and solve crimes. Though many are optimistic this could be helpful, some Americans are worried it could lead to privacy concerns or wrongful arrests. On the Rundown, Heritage Foundation Tech Policy research associate Jake Denton joins to discuss why "oversight and transparency" are key to assuring AI is used responsibly, the science behind how the technology could catch criminals, and the potential shortfalls that could come with relying on it too heavily in an investigation.
 
 
Plus, commentary from host of OutKick’s Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Evening Edition: Teamsters And UPS Reach Deal That Potentially Avoids Strike </title>
      <description>UPS and the Teamsters may have avoided a work stoppage that could have started next week by reaching a tentative new labor agreement. The agreement still needs to be ratified by well over three hundred thousand Teamsters but both sides seem to be positive about the deal. FOX's John Saucier speaks with Jeff Flock, Fox Business Network senior correspondent, about this tentative deal, what each side got and the possibility of it being ratified.

      <title>"Cover-up": Why Some In Congress Are Taking UFOs Very Seriously</title>
      <description>Several whistleblowers have come forward claiming that the U.S. government is covering up the existence of UFOs. This Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee will conduct a hearing investigating the implications of unidentified anomalous phenomena on national security, public safety, and government transparency. Tennessee Congressman Tim Burchett is a firm believer that the American public has the right to know about UAPs and that the government is allegedly suppressing the voices of those who have witnessed them. Burchett joins the Rundown to explain how this week's hearing will open the doors for future investigations, share why he thinks the Pentagon should open up about the existence of UFOs, and preview the testimonies expected in the hearing.

America is experiencing "the summer of strikes." All sorts of labor union members, from Hollywood folks to rail workers, have taken to the streets to demand better compensation, but now a strike may be looming from the United Parcel Service (UPS), which could have a serious nationwide impact. 340,000 UPS workers have stated that if they do not reach a labor deal with UPS by the end of the month, they'll refuse to work — and if there aren't enough employees to deliver the millions of packages Americans order every day, a crisis could be around the corner. On the Rundown, FOX Business Correspondent Jeff Flock explains how this strike could "throw a monkey wrench" into the supply chains, what agreement drivers are hoping to reach with UPS, and how President Biden's pro-strike stance may be one of the reasons we're seeing so many strikes across the nation.

Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of "Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla."

      <title>Are The Culture Wars Fueling Our Military Recruiting Crisis?</title>
      <description>Military recruitment numbers are at the lowest recorded levels in several years, with only 9 percent of young people in the United States saying they would consider joining the armed forces. Some are turning their attention to various requirements that make many Americans ineligible for service. As recruitment goals lag, military leaders are now seriously considering easing their enlistment requirements. Lawmakers too are seeking to relax guidelines, more recently targeting policies surrounding marijuana use and height and weight requirements for certain branches. Marine veteran and FOX News contributor Johnny Joey Jones joins the Rundown to discuss why the military needs to change the way it presents itself to bolster recruitment and shares a few stories from his new book, 'Unbroken Bonds of Battle.'
It appears to be a matter of time before the U.S. energy sector becomes more reliant on a growing nuclear industry. This was a main focus of last week's Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing, where representatives discussed the merits of addressing the obstacles in the way of building more nuclear reactors in our country. Chairman of that subcommittee, Congressman Jeff Duncan, says unlike many issues in Congress, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are committed to supporting America's future with nuclear energy. Rep. Duncan joins the Rundown to explain what Congress is doing to bring Americans nuclear power as soon as possible, why this specific issue has earned bipartisan support on the Hill, and what steps are being taken to ensure this technology will be implemented safely.
Plus, commentary by a former investment banker and author of 'You Will Own Nothing,' Carol Roth.

      <title>Extra: Could A Third-Party Candidate Actually Win The Presidency?</title>
      <description>Third parties in the United States historically do not perform well in presidential elections. 

However, a Quinnipiac University Poll suggest nearly half of voters would consider a third-party candidate. 

This past Monday, the No Labels campaign announced that they may add a name to the ticket on the condition that former President Donald Trump and Vice President Joe Biden become the official party nominees. No Labels says they aim to give Americans who dislike these candidates a chance to vote for someone who has nuanced, moderate opinions. 

Some fear that a third party may spoil the election by taking votes away from one candidate and inadvertently boosting the other. 

No Labels National Director Joe Cunningham, joined host Dave Anthony to detail what it would take for No Labels to present a third-party candidate and they would even have a chance of winning

He also discussed the likelihood that Sen. Joe Manchin could run as the No Labels candidate and if he'd be any more than an election spoiler.

Due to time limitations, we could not include our entire conversations in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the complete interview with No Labels National Director Joe Cunningham.

      <title>From Washington: The Border Crisis And The Rise Of Cartel Crime</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/07/23/from-washington-the-border-crisis-and-the-rise-of-cartel-crime/</link>
      <description>The House Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing this week, examining how the Biden Administration's border policy has impacted the rise of cartel crime. As record apprehensions continue, some Republicans have called for the impeachment of Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. Former acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf weighs in on how the border crisis has allowed cartels to increase drug and human smuggling, offers solutions to stem the flow of fentanyl into the nation, and shares his thoughts on the job that Secretary Mayorkas has done.
 
Former President Donald Trump could possibly be indicted for a third time, this time for his alleged involvement in efforts to overturn the 2020 Presidential Election. The former President is already facing charges for making hush money payments to adult film star, Stormy Daniels, in Manhattan and separate charges in Miami for his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Although he faces unprecedented legal challenges for a presidential candidate, he continues to gain in popularity amongst voters. FOX News Radio Political Analyst, Josh Kraushaar discusses how the possible third indictment will affect the GOP frontrunner's chances of becoming the Republican nominee and touches upon how a third-party candidate could backfire.

      <title>Extra: Suffolk County DA Details How They Caught The Gilgo Beach Serial Killer Suspect</title>
      <description>For more than a decade, the country has been intrigued by the mysterious and brutal murders known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings. 
Intrigue turned to shock and relief earlier this month, when the authorities announced the arrest of a suspect.


The story begins back in 2010 when human remains were found on Gilgo beach, Long Island New York.

Law enforcement found the remains of Melissa Barthelemy, and then Amber Lynn Costello, Megan Waterman and Maureen Brainard-Barnes... all of them women in their 20s working as escorts. 
Six other bodies were also found, but the investigation ran dry for years. 

Until now. 

59-year-old Rex Heuermann is now in custody linked to 3 of those killings. 

One big break came when law enforcement matched his DNA from a leftover pizza crust he tossed out to a hair found on a victim. 

Heuermann says he's innocent.

Days after the arrest, Suffolk Country District Attorney Ray Tierney, who ran the task force which eventually identified Heuermann, join FOX News' Alex Hogan on the FOX News Rundown to discuss how police caught the accused serial killer. 

Tierney discussed how nearly a hundred law enforcement officials worked together for years on this case, the critical pieces of evidence they found, and his hope that bringing the alleged suspect to justice will bring peace to the victims' families.
 
Due to time limitations, we could not include Alex Hogan's entire conversations in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the complete interview with Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney.

      <title>From Washington: Congress Pushes For UFO Transparency</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/07/22/from-washington-congress-pushes-for-ufo-transparency/</link>
      <description>On Tuesday, the Senate voted to begin considering the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which authorizes the Department of Defense's annual budget and expenditures. While the bill usually gains widespread bipartisan support, the House's version of the bill faces opposition due to the controversial social issues it addresses. Meanwhile, the House and Senate are hoping that several bipartisan declassification bills related to unidentified anomalous phenomena will provide more transparency surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram previews what the week ahead looks like before another summer recess for Congress.

This week, Israeli President Isaac Herzog met with President Biden to discuss diplomatic relations with the United States amid tensions over Israel's judicial overhaul. On Wednesday, President Herzog delivered a speech before Congress in which he stressed the importance of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons while also addressing antisemitic criticisms of Israel. President Herzog's Washington D.C. visit came on the heels of Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu's push to limit the judicial powers of Israel's Supreme Court judges. Former State Department Spokesperson and Founder of Polaris National Security Morgan Ortagus discusses the significance of President Herzog's trip and weighs in on the Biden administration's management of relations in the Middle East.

      <title>Evening Edition: A Week Of Hunter Biden Probe Bombshells</title>
      <description>For years, President Biden's son, Hunter, and his association with energy firms in both China and Ukraine have been the target of speculation and investigations. The nebulous relationship between President Biden and his son's employment hasn't just been fuel for controversy; some Republicans have called for the impeachment of DOJ officials and even President Biden himself.
The Biden White House and campaign had always insisted the President was uninvolved in his son's business dealings. However, their language describing the President's links to his son's international dealings has shifted slightly after an unclassified FBI document released this week contained allegations that then-Vice President Joe Biden and Hunter Biden were part of a bribery scheme involving Burisma CEO Mykola Zlochevksy.
Fox News Digital political reporter explains the latest Hunter Biden probe bombshells, how the Biden White House is responding, and why Republican lawmakers are so concerned over how the DOJ handled the investigation into both Hunter and his father.

      <title>RFK Jr. Creates A Stir On Capitol Hill</title>
      <description>Could former President Donald Trump be a no-show at the first Republican Debate? FOX News Sunday host Shannon Bream returns to the Rundown to discuss the 2024 GOP primary field and if Trump, the current frontrunner, will pay a political price if he decides not to take the debate stage on August 23rd in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Bream also discusses presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s testimony on Capitol Hill, the Hunter Biden probe and its potential impact on the presidential race, and she weighs in on the 'Barbie' vs. "Oppenheimer" debate.
On Thursday, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before Congress in a House hearing about censorship. Republican lawmakers say they believe the hearing showed censorship in action, while Democrats say RFK Jr. has been promoting antisemitic and anti-Asian theories about COVID-19. Author and 2024 Democratic candidate Marianne Williamson joins the Rundown to discuss her presidential candidacy. She breaks down the RFK Jr. appearance before Congress for a censorship hearing, her concern that the Democratic National Committee won't let the other Democratic candidates debate President Biden, and the need for a bigger conversation about COVID-19 and restoring Americans' trust in institutions.
Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

FOX News Sunday host Shannon Bream returns to the Rundown to discuss the 2024 GOP primary field and if Trump, the current frontrunner, will pay a political price if he decides not to take the debate stage on August 23rd in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Kennedy Jr.'s testimony on Capitol Hill, the Hunter Biden probe and its potential impact on the presidential race, and she weighs in on the 'Barbie' vs. "Oppenheimer" debate.

Author and 2024 Democratic candidate Marianne Williamson joins the Rundown to discuss her presidential candidacy. She breaks down the RFK Jr. appearance before Congress for a censorship hearing, her concern that the Democratic National Committee won't let the other Democratic candidates debate President Biden, and the need for a bigger conversation about COVID-19 and restoring Americans' trust in institutions.

      <title>Is The Hunter Biden Probe Moving The Needle For Voters?</title>
      <description>Two IRS whistleblowers testified before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, alleging the Department of Justice had meddled in the probe investigating the President’s son, Hunter Biden. IRS Special Agent Joseph Ziegler joined fellow agent Gary Shapley in saying he "felt handcuffed" while conducting the investigation. Republican lawmakers focused on the whistleblowers’ claims of irregularities in the probe, while Democratic lawmakers highlighted that the prosecutor in charge had told Congress he had complete investigative autonomy. But what do voters think of all this? Pollster and President of Maslansky + Partners, Lee Carter, joins the Rundown to explain what the polls tell us about the impact of these probes and Oversight hearings on Americans' 2024 votes. Later, she explains what polling suggests will be the most influential voting issues.

Third parties in the United States historically do not perform well in presidential elections. However, on Monday, the No Labels campaign announced that they may add a name to the ticket on the condition that former President Donald Trump and Vice President Joe Biden become the official party nominees. No Labels says they aim to give Americans who dislike these candidates a chance to vote for someone who has nuanced, moderate opinions. Some fear that a third party may spoil the election by taking votes away from one candidate and inadvertently boosting the other. No Labels National Director, Joe Cunningham, joins the podcast to detail what it would take for No Labels to present a third-party candidate, share the history behind No Labels, and explain why West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin is rumored to be their candidate.

Plus, commentary by President of Students for Life of America, Kristan Hawkins.

      <title>Vivek Ramaswamy's Plan To Catch President Trump</title>
      <description>American entrepreneur and 2024 GOP primary candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has been increasing in popularity ahead of the first Republican debate next month. The first-time politician is currently ranked third in the most recent FOX News poll, trailing behind the front-runner, former President Donald Trump, and the runner-up, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Ramaswamy joins the Rundown to discuss what attributes make him a top contender in the primary race, explains the contradictory statements he has made about the former president and the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol, and shares why he would not be satisfied in the vice president position if the opportunity presented itself.

What is the future of America’s office buildings? In a post-pandemic world, remote and hybrid work may be agreeable for American employees, but the owners of commercial real estate are feeling the squeeze as major cities see the demand for office space significantly decline. A recent survey suggests that the changing work environment norms may cause the value of office buildings in the nation’s urban hubs to decrease by $800 billion in less than a decade. Fox Business’ Lydia Hu joins the podcast from an abandoned Manhattan office space to explain why there are so many vacancies despite many workers returning to the office, the strategies of building owners to lure people back, and what long-term impact this post-pandemic shift could have on the commercial real-estate industry.

Plus, commentary by WSJ columnist and author of “The Biden Malaise,” Kim Strassel.

      <title>The High Stakes Battle For A West Virginia Senate Seat</title>
      <description>Sitting West Virginia Governor Jim Justice (R-WV) is looking to take Senator Joe Manchin's (D-WV) Senate seat in the coming 2024 election, potentially causing a significant shift in the balance of power in Congress. As it stands right now, Democrats hold a Senate majority, with 51 seats to the GOP's 49. Pundits have forecast that Senator Manchin is one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection this campaign cycle. On the Rundown, Governor Jim Justice discusses his campaign, talks about the future of fossil fuels in his state as the Biden administration pushes renewable energy, and explains why he believes he has the upper hand over his fellow Republican primary challenger, Congressman Alex Mooney (R-WV).

The Gilgo Beach serial killings had gone unsolved since 2010, when Long Island police uncovered the remains of 11 murder victims. Over a decade later, authorities believe they have caught the killer. 59-year-old Rex Heuermann was placed in custody last week and charged with the murder of three of the victims: Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello. So how did police finally find this serial killer suspect after all these years? Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney joins the podcast to discuss how nearly a hundred law enforcement officials worked together for years on this case, the miraculous DNA evidence found using Heuermann's discarded pizza crust, and his hope that bringing the alleged suspect to justice will bring peace to the victims' families.
 
Plus, commentary by former Congressman Jason Chaffetz, host of the Jason in the House podcast.

      <itunes:summary>Sitting West Virginia Governor Jim Justice (R-WV) is looking to take Senator Joe Manchin's (D-WV) Senate seat in the coming 2024 election, potentially causing a significant shift in the balance of power in Congress. As it stands right now, Democrats hold a Senate majority, with 51 seats to the GOP's 49. Pundits have forecast that Senator Manchin is one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection this campaign cycle. On the Rundown, Governor Jim Justice discusses his campaign, talks about the future of fossil fuels in his state as the Biden administration pushes renewable energy, and explains why he believes he has the upper hand over his fellow Republican primary challenger, Congressman Alex Mooney (R-WV).

The Gilgo Beach serial killings had gone unsolved since 2010, when Long Island police uncovered the remains of 11 murder victims. Over a decade later, authorities believe they have caught the killer. 59-year-old Rex Heuermann was placed in custody last week and charged with the murder of three of the victims: Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello. So how did police finally find this serial killer suspect after all these years? Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney joins the podcast to discuss how nearly a hundred law enforcement officials worked together for years on this case, the miraculous DNA evidence found using Heuermann's discarded pizza crust, and his hope that bringing the alleged suspect to justice will bring peace to the victims' families.
 
Plus, commentary by former Congressman Jason Chaffetz, host of the Jason in the House podcast.

      <title>How House Republicans Aim to Kick Corruption Out of the DOJ, FBI &amp; White House</title>
      <description>Here is the blurb that will be posted with the FOX News Rundown podcast for JULY 17, 2023:
FBI Director Christopher Wray was in the hot seat last week, facing tough questions from the House Judiciary Committee regarding the FBI’s alleged bias and unfair treatment of conservatives. After several allegations that the FBI is being weaponized against the GOP and has wrongfully worked alongside social media companies to censor many conservative viewpoints, House Republicans have expressed their determination to eradicate any leadership that has led to this alleged corruption. Though Director Wray has denied all allegations of misconduct or bias, House Republicans will continue to investigate until they feel that balance within the FBI is restored. On the Rundown, Congressman Mike Johnson (R-LA) joins to discuss his frustration with Wray’s denial despite “explosive” evidence of bias, why he believes “institutional rot” is at the core of the FBI’s alleged wrongdoing, and how he and fellow House Republicans plan to address this issue moving forward.
This week, the FIFA Women’s World Cup will kick off, with the games taking place in the Southern Hemisphere for the first time in the tournament’s history. The games roll out on FOX Sports starting July 20th and take place across Australia and New Zealand. Anticipation is building around the performance of the United States Women’s National Team, which has won four of the eight Women’s World Cups and has a chance to become the first team–in men’s or women’s–to win three consecutive titles. Two-Time FIFA World Cup champion Carli Lloyd and Former United States men’s national soccer team defender Alexi Lalas are both FOX Soccer Analysts and join the Rundown to discuss the great expectations placed on the upcoming games, what’s behind the rapid expansion of professional soccer fandom in the United States, and their most memorable experiences and opponents on the field.
Plus, commentary by former White House speechwriter and Fox News Contributor Marc Thiessen.

      <title>Extra: Combatting PTSD And The Overprescribing Of Mental Health Drugs</title>
      <description>Kelsi Sheren enlisted in the Canadian Army at just 19 years old and served her country in Afghanistan. 

However, her combat experience, witnessing destruction and death, left her with post-traumatic stress disorder. 

Years later, Sheren says she still has her struggles with PTSD every day, but she has since turned her pain into passion.

Kelsi Sheren joined the FOX News Rundown's Chris Foster recently to discuss her new book, "Brass &amp; Unity: One Woman's Journey Through the Hell of Afghanistan and Back" and detailed how her mental health journey led her to create a booming jewelry business. 

She also talked about her work with veterans and why she is very concerned that many former soldiers, like herself, are overprescribed medication while not being allowed affordable access to alternative therapies. 

Due to time limitations, we could not include our entire conversation in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the complete interviews with author, entrepreneur , and veteran Kelsi Sheren.

      <title>From Washington: Tensions Rise Following FBI Director's Testimony </title>
      <description>Congress is back in session following its summer recess. Although many used the time off to relax and recharge, lawmakers are picking up right where they left off. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram summarizes FBI Director Christopher Wray's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, where he defended his record after lawmakers accused the Bureau of conducting politically motivated investigations. Later Chad explains why Congresswoman Majorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was removed from the House Freedom Caucus and details Tuesday's Senate investigative subcommittee hearing regarding the PGA Tour's partnership with Saudi-backed LIV Golf. 

New Hampshire has only successfully produced one President, Franklin Pierce. However, the "Live Free or Die" state has made a name for itself as one of the most influential states in the Presidential primaries. New Hampshire state law dictates the primary should be held on the second Tuesday of March or at least seven days before any other primary in the country. However, this first-in-the-nation status is being challenged by the Democratic National Committee, whose proposed revamped calendar puts South Carolina at the front of the primary calendar. New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, weighs in on how the new schedule will affect New Hampshire's status as a battleground state and explains the DNC's reasoning for changing the calendar.

      <title>Extra: How Long Should The U.S. Fund The War In The Ukraine?</title>
      <description>This week's historic NATO summit wrapped up in Lithuania as leaders there came together to offer a joint declaration of support, aimed at bolstering Ukraine's military capability. There was also a lot of discussion about whether Ukraine should join the alliance.  

President Zelensky was clearly disappointed his war-torn nation was told to wait, but he voiced his appreciation for the weapons and support they have been receiving from the West.

But back in the U.S, there continues to be some questions about whether too much money is being spent on Ukraine, during a time of rising inflation, and higher energy prices

Earlier this week on the FOX News Rundown, FOX News Correspondent Benjamin Hall spoke with two senators who take opposing stances on this growing debate: 

Kentucky's Senator Rand Paul explained why he believes the U.S. is carrying too much of the costs. While Alaska's Republican Senator Dan Sullivan defended sending aid to the nation, but also said he feels the Biden administration is moving to slow in an effort to help the Ukrainians beat the Russians. 

Due to time limitations, we could not include Benjamin Hall's entire conversations in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the complete interviews with both Senator Rand Paul and Senator Dan Sullivan.

      <title>From Washington: Ukraine's Path To NATO</title>
      <description>NATO leaders welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Lithuania this week, 16 months after Russia's invasion. President Zelenskyy voiced his frustration with the lack of a clear timeline for his country's entry into the alliance. Many U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns regarding the possibility of Ukraine's membership in NATO, fearing it will only escalate tensions with Russia and bring the alliance closer to conflict. Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova discusses her takeaways from the NATO summit, concerns over the use of controversial cluster munitions, and bipartisan support she's received from lawmakers for U.S. budget assistance to Ukraine.

After a ​four-year term, United States Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley will retire in the fall of 2023, leaving a vacant spot to be appointed by the President and passed by the Senate. However, this position along with many other military positions is held up in the Senate by one Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), who is protesting the Pentagon's policy that helps reimburse servicemembers for abortion costs if they traveled to a legal state to access one. FOX News National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin reveals what we know about the possible new Joint Chief of Staff General Charles Q. Brown, details what other military positions that have been on hold, and explains what needs to happen in order to fill these senior spots.

      <title>Sec. Buttigieg Talks Travel Woes, EVs, And Rail Safety</title>
      <description>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has assured Americans that air travel in the United States will bounce back following a series of mass delays and cancellations over the holiday weekend. Due to pandemic-related staff shortages, airlines say they are struggling to provide enough crew to get their planes off the ground in a timely manner, if at all. Critics have highlighted that the issue stems from structural failures within the Federal Aviation Administration, with many pointing their fingers at the man in charge, Transportation Secretary Buttigieg. Secretary Buttigieg joins the Rundown to share the steps the airline industry is taking to address the system-wide problems impacting travelers, how the Inflation Reduction Act is making electric vehicles more affordable for the average consumer, and his goal to modernize the U.S. railways.

An eventful week for the Biden administration both domestically and overseas. The President traveled to Europe for the NATO summit, where world leaders promised Ukraine would eventually be granted NATO membership after the war. Meanwhile, in the States, the Secret Service closes its investigation into who brought cocaine into the White House, despite reportedly finding no evidence and providing no answers. FOX News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream joins to break down all the major stories this week, including major membership decisions made at the NATO summit, why the FBI and other government agencies cannot communicate with social media companies due to a recent ruling, and how the Secret Service's cocaine conclusion is leaving many Americans skeptical, as the White House is supposed to be one of the most highly secured buildings in the country.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary from host of OutKick’s Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>How Much And For How Long. The Debate Over Ukraine Aid</title>
      <description>Defense spending and support for Ukraine were the major topics of discussion for NATO leaders. Member nations refused to admit Ukraine into the alliance now that they remain at war with Russia; however, Moscow's invasion has forced NATO to get more serious about making sure each country is spending 2 percent of its GDP on military defense. At the summit, President Biden reassured Americans that America and its Western allies will continue to support Ukraine's military, but a few U.S. lawmakers are concerned about exactly how long that may take, questioning the established bipartisan support for Ukraine in the form of funding and weapons. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) joins to explain why he is hesitant to support Ukraine with American tax dollars and where he believes that money could be better spent. Later, Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) joins to explain why security in Europe is important for the United States and what the administration could be doing to end the war faster.

Last month, U.S. inflation eased to the slowest pace in more than two years. The Consumer Price Index climbed to a mere 3% in June, significantly lower than the 9.1% peak the country witnessed this time last year. Although it may seem as though consumers have more cash on hand as inflation falters, people are still struggling to make ends meet. Co-anchor of "The Big Money Show" on FOX Business, Taylor Riggs, joins the podcast to break down the real reason why consumers are spending more, share why some believe that the Federal Reserve's inflation goal is unrealistic, and explain the reason why small businesses are not as optimistic as the data suggests.

Plus, commentary from FOX News Contributor Joe Concha.

      <title>GOP To Grill The FBI: Is There Bias In The Bureau?</title>
      <description>The "Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation" hearing begins in the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, where FBI Director Christopher Wray is expected to testify before Congress and face tough questions from those who distrust the integrity of the bureau. The FBI has recently faced allegations of operating with political bias after the agency searched former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago home for classified documents. Director Wray will appear before the House Judiciary for the first time since the GOP took control of the House and is expected to confront the alleged politicization of federal agencies and his lack of transparency regarding whistleblower allegations. Former FBI Assistant Director Chris Swecker joins the Rundown to explain what the FBI needs to do to prove such biases don't exist and his belief that there must be greater separation between the FBI and the Justice Department.

At the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania this week, President Biden and other NATO members came to an agreement to allow Sweden to join the alliance, yet members concurred that adding Ukraine remains out of reach while the war with Russia persists. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy criticized the NATO members for this decision, panning the decision to delay Ukraine’s NATO membership without being given a concrete timeline, yet the members did agree Ukraine will join the alliance when the right conditions are met. On the Rundown, former Texas Senator and U.S. Ambassador to NATO during the Trump administration, Kay Bailey Hutchison, joins the podcast to explain what impact we could see on the world stage from the expansion of NATO and how the member nations walked a delicate line between supporting Ukraine and avoiding open war with Russia.

Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of "Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla."

      <title>Evening Edition: Sweden's Ascension Into NATO Praised, Is Ukraine Next?   </title>
      <description>President Biden and other world leaders attending a summit in Lithuania are celebrating Sweden's ascension into NATO after getting a green light from Turkey. NATO member states have said that Ukraine will eventually be able to join the alliance but would not give a timeline for that to happen while the war is going on. FOX's John Saucier speaks with Ambassador Kurt Volker, a Distinguished Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) and former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, who says NATO expanding its membership is exactly what Putin did not want.

      <title>Is Fmr. President Trump The GOP’s Inevitable Nominee?</title>
      <description>Former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson is among the many Republicans running for president this election cycle. Although he has not yet met the requirements, the former governor is confident he will appear on the debate stage in Milwaukee next month despite currently being tens of thousands of donors short of qualifying. Governor Hutchinson joins the Rundown to talk about why he refuses to endorse former President Trump if he eventually becomes the party nominee, his belief that the Biden administration has given Americans unrealistic expectations about the war in Ukraine, why our nation's leadership should prioritize curbing its federal spending, and the reasons President Joe Biden's trip to South Carolina failed to address that problem.

After the recent Supreme Court decision ending affirmative action in college admissions, many are now turning their attention to the workplace, where employment diversity programs (like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) could be the next to face scrutiny from the courts. DEI has been polarizing in the world of politics, where Democratic voters and politicians advocate on behalf of these hiring initiatives, while Republicans have criticized these policies as unfair and discriminatory. On the podcast, employment law expert and CEO of ELI Inc., Stephen Paskoff, joins to break down exactly what DEI means for a company’s hiring practices, how employers’ diversity initiatives will be impacted by the latest SCOTUS decision, whether existing programs will soon face legal challenges, and how the affirmative action ruling may change the way companies pursue diversity.

Plus, commentary by columnist David Marcus.

      <title>Rep. Turner Talks Upcoming NATO Summit &amp; Secretary Yellen’s “Disappointing” Trip to Beijing</title>
      <description>It’s an important week overseas, as 31 world leaders, including President Biden, head to Vilnius, Lithuania to attend a NATO summit. As the war on Ukraine surpasses the 500-day mark, the group will likely focus on how they can continue effectively aiding Ukrainian allies and potentially increasing the group’s military spending to defeat Russia. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has returned from a trip to Beijing, where she bowed several times to a Chinese official — a move many condemned, claiming it demonstrated subservience on behalf of America. House Intelligence Committee Chairman and Head of the U.S. Delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Congressman Mike Turner, has been heavily tuned into everything happening overseas. He joins the Rundown to discuss what he believes the key topics will be at this week’s NATO Summit, why there’s broad bipartisan agreement that the U.S. should continue aiding Ukraine, and his reaction to Secretary Yellen’s recent “disappointing” trip to China.
Kelsi Sheren enlisted in the Canadian Army at just 19 years old and eventually reached her goal of serving her country in Afghanistan. Her service experience in the Middle East left her with post-traumatic stress disorder and battling suicidal thoughts after being sent home because of her deteriorating mental health. Sheren says she still has her struggles with PTSD every day, but she has turned her pain into passion. On the Rundown, she shares the details of how her mental health journey led her to create a successful jewelry business, her advocacy on behalf of veterans for better support and resources, and talks about her new book, Brass &amp; Unity: One Woman’s Journey Through the Hell of Afghanistan and Back.

      <title>Extra: Kim Kardashian Helped Her Get A Second Chance. Now She's Paying It Forward.</title>
      <description>Alice Marie Johnson spent 21 years in prison after she was sentence to life without parole in 1997 for cocaine trafficking in Memphis, Tennessee. 

She was a single mother of five children at the time and says all she did was relay coded phone messages for drug dealers.

Her story and the severe sentence got the attention of Kim Kardashian. The reality star took up Johnson's cause and visited the White House on her behalf in 2018.

Just a week later, President Trump granted her clemency and had her released.

Alice Marie Johnson recently joined the Rundown's Chris Foster to discuss her past, her time in prison and how she is using freedom to help others stay out of jail.

Johnson also discussed justice reform and the drugs policies that put her in prison for over two decades.
Due to time limitations, we could not include the entire conversation in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear our entire unedited interview with Alice Marie Johnson and learn more about how she's giving back after getting a second chance at life.

She was a single mother of five children at the time and says all she did was relay coded phone messages for drug dealers.

Her story and the severe sentence got the attention of Kim Kardashian. The reality star took up Johnson's cause and visited the White House on her behalf in 2018.

Just a week later, President Trump granted her clemency and had her released.

Alice Marie Johnson recently joined the Rundown's Chris Foster to discuss her past, her time in prison and how she is using freedom to help others stay out of jail.

Johnson also discussed justice reform and the drugs policies that put her in prison for over two decades.
Due to time limitations, we could not include the entire conversation in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear our entire unedited interview with Alice Marie Johnson and learn more about how she's giving back after getting a second chance at life.

      <title>From Washington: Could The Democrats' Supreme Court Setbacks Boost Them In 2024?</title>
      <description>Democrats are gearing up for the 2024 elections, hoping they can use some recent legal losses at the Supreme Court to fire up their base and target Republicans in vulnerable seats. Last month, the High Court voted to strike down both affirmative action in college admissions and President Biden's student loan debt relief plan. Last year, the party was able to successfully use the overturning of Roe vs. Wade to rally voters and prevent a 'red wave' in the midterms. Democrats are hoping the latest Supreme Court decisions will have the same effect in 2024. Co-Director of the FOX News Poll and Professor at the University of Texas Austin Daron Shaw discusses the Democrats' strategy ahead of the next election cycle.
 
Last month, members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee visited Moore County, North Carolina during a field hearing on enhancing America's grid security. The goal of the hearing was to learn how to prevent the power grid from vulnerabilities, such as cyberattacks after the Duke Energy power substation was attacked last year leaving over forty-thousand homes and businesses without power. Congressman Larry Bucshon (R-IN) explains how the United States can prevent future attacks, and why lawmakers and private companies need to cooperate to protect critical infrastructure.

      <title>From Washington: The White House Cocaine Mystery</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/07/08/from-washington-the-white-house-cocaine-mystery/</link>
      <description>It's been nearly a week since a small bag of cocaine was found in the West Wing of the White House and the Secret Service has still yet to identify who the drugs belong to. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) is calling on the head of the U.S. Secret Service to give Congress more information about the incident and has demanded a staff-level briefing on the matter by July 14. Many fear that this incident showcases a lack of security to the country's adversaries. FOX News Washington Based Correspondent Griff Jenkins breaks down how the cocaine may have entered the building, what the next steps in the investigation are, and previews President Joe Biden's trip to Europe.
 
The highly anticipated 2023 NATO Summit in Vilnius, Lithuania is set to take place this coming week. As the war between Russia and Ukraine rages on, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is hoping his nation gets an invite to join the alliance. However, NATO leaders are divided over if and when Ukraine should get membership. Former United States Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor joins to discuss the history of former Soviet states attempting to join NATO, the likelihood of Sweden being accepted into the alliance, and how the Summit could impact Russia's war on Ukraine.

      <title>Are Voters Buying Bidenomics?</title>
      <description>America's Crime Crisis: Republicans and Democrats remain far apart on police reform, with conservatives pushing for more police funding while Democrats have advocated for increased officer accountability. Last year, police departments across the country reported officers resigning in unprecedented numbers, creating widespread vacancies and recruitment issues that spiraled into a major public safety concern. Before Congressman Pete Stauber (R-MN) was on Capitol Hill, he was a police officer laying his life on the line to protect his community. With a unique perspective as former law enforcement and now legislator, Rep. Stauber joins the Rundown to explain how politics are driving people away from the law enforcement profession, why he has fought to keep qualified immunity in any crime or policing bills, and his optimism that bipartisan crime legislation is possible.

But first, President Joe Biden traveled to South Carolina on Thursday to tout his economic accomplishments and further his Bidenomics agenda ahead of the 2024 election. Recent polling shows that President Biden's overall approval rating has steadily declined since April 2021; however, the administration is using the visit to gain traction in the red state, as South Carolina is the first on the 2024 presidential primary calendar. FOX News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream joins the podcast to explain the President's strategy leading up to the election, how former President Trump is using his legal troubles to boost his campaign, and why some are calling for politicians to limit their contact with social media companies.

Plus, commentary from host of OutKick’s Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

      <title>Evening Edition: Could Meta's 'Threads' Replace Twitter?</title>
      <description>Many social media platforms have tried to take on Elon Musk's Twitter and now Mark Zuckerberg's Meta has launched 'Threads', another app of text-based postings.

      <title>What’s Next For Student Loan Debt?</title>
      <description>America's Crime Crisis: Over the holiday weekend, the country saw mass shootings occur in Baltimore, Fort Worth, and Philadelphia, displaying a dangerous and concerning trend when it comes to violence in America’s cities. Since the summer of 2020, across the country, law enforcement has seen their policing practices come under strict scrutiny, facing calls for more body cameras, removing qualified immunity, and defunding the police. But as violence continues to impact urban communities, how can we keep the streets safe for Americans? Former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly knows what it takes to manage crime in a big city, and he says that being a police officer and battling crime have only gotten harder since he was in charge. He joins the Rundown to discuss what policing tactics he would bring back, how crime has changed over the years, and what solutions from law enforcement are proving effective.
But first, last week, the Supreme Court ruled against President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program, prompting the administration to develop a Plan B. The Saving on Valuable Education (SAVE) plan revamps the current student loan regulations and offers no penalties for missing a payment. However, the President says those who can afford to make payments should, and that the SAVE plan is not a replacement for the pause. On the Rundown, Beth Akers, Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, shares why students should be more strategic when choosing schools, breaks down the next steps for borrowers, and explains why the higher education system gets away with charging such high tuition.

Plus, commentary by Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Dr. Ben Carson.

      <title>Could Recent Redistricting Rulings Shift the Balance of Power in Washington?</title>
      <description>The balance of power in Washington could soon shift, as recent redistricting rulings may heavily impact election maps in states like Louisiana, Alabama, and North Carolina. While Republicans maintain a tight majority in the House and Democrats hold an even slimmer majority in the Senate, every state's votes will count in upcoming elections as recent rulings could have a more significant influence than in the past. On the Rundown, Managing Editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics Kyle Kondik breaks down each of the court's rulings, how much of an impact they could have on 2024 elections, and the notable differences between partisan and racial gerrymandering.
Americas Crime Crisis: Alice Marie Johnson spent over two decades in prison for drug trafficking in Memphis, Tennessee, and was released in 2018 after Kim Kardashian worked alongside the Trump administration to set her free. Johnson felt that the "time didn't fit the crime" after she received a life sentence without parole for her first offense. She joins the Rundown to share her story, talk about why she started the TAG foundation, and why she has dedicated herself to helping others sentenced to similar crimes gain their freedom.
Plus, commentary by Dr. Kevin Sabet, former Drug Advisor to Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama.

      <title>Evening Edition: Veteran Finds Purpose After The Military </title>
      <description>While veterans only make up around seven percent of the population, they sadly account for almost a quarter of suicide deaths in the United States. A large reason attributed to these deaths is service members feeling they lack purpose after returning home. FOX's John Saucier speaks with Sam Floyd, Marine veteran and founder of 'Operation Coffee Roasters', about his struggle to find purpose after serving and his efforts to raise awareness to veteran suicide through his coffee business.

      <title>This Independence Day: A Veteran’s Tale of Survival &amp; Commitment to Our Country</title>
      <description>This Fourth of July, we celebrate the men and women who have risked their lives for America’s continuing independence. Senior Master Sergeant Israel Del Toro shares his story of resilience after his Humvee was hit by an IED in 2005 while serving in Afghanistan. After being given only a 15% chance of survival, Del Toro re-enlisted in the Air Force with an amputated arm and only partial use of his fingers. Since then, he has dedicated his life to raising his children and serving his country. He joins the podcast to talk about his new book A Patriot’s Promise: Protecting My Brothers, Fighting for My Life, and Keeping My Word, share his journey to recovery, and how he continues to keep a promise he made to his dad at 12 years old.
America’s Crime Crisis: Many major U.S. cities including Los Angeles, New York and St. Louis continue to battle high levels of violent crime, and some lawmakers have voiced concerns that the reason they are struggling is due to Democratic leadership enforcing ‘soft on crime’ policies. Despite this claim, these cities continue electing progressive leaders who support the same approach; to make criminal justice reforms that tackle crime while allowing more chances for rehabilitation. On the Rundown, St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones discusses how she is partnering with law enforcement, behavioral health specialists, and mayors across the U.S. to combat the crime crisis. She also explains how she believes the pandemic &amp; inflation have impacted the U.S. crime rate and her plans to strike the right balance between holding offenders accountable &amp; offering second chances.
Plus, commentary by author and vice president of communications for Focus on The Family, Paul Batura.

      <title>Are America's Best Days Behind Us? Americans May Say Yes, Rep. Issa Says No.</title>
      <description>It’s been a busy week in Washington, D.C., with the Supreme Court announcing some of the most highly anticipated rulings of the year. The Court’s decision to block President Biden’s $400 billion student loan forgiveness plan and end affirmative action in college admissions received mixed feedback across the country — as many Democrats voiced their disapproval of the decisions, while the GOP has shown support of the Court. Also in the headlines is new information on the Hunter Biden case. As IRS whistleblowers make further allegations of politicization and misconduct by the DOJ, many Republicans are calling for a freeze on the younger Biden’s plea deal until these claims are investigated. On the Rundown, California Congressman Darrell Issa joins to explain why he supports the Supreme Court’s decisions and how their ruling reflects where “liberal California has been for two decades.” He also discusses his thoughts on the Hunter Biden investigation and how he believes the U.S. government must change to restore Americans’ faith in the government and the country as a whole.
America’s Crime Crisis: When crime goes viral, law enforcement across the country has reported difficulties keeping it under control. TikTok has sparked some interesting trends over the years, from viral dances to whipped coffee, but now teens are filming themselves committing crimes like in “The Kia Challenge,” where some are posting tutorials on how to steal a car. The platform claims that it does not promote such content, but thousands of videos surfaced of people participating in “rob mobs,” car theft, and other criminal activities where the perpetrators appeared unafraid of the consequences. Former FBI Special Agent John Iannarelli and Professor of Criminal Justice at the University of Central Florida Raymond Suarez joins the Rundown to discuss the ways law enforcement tries to prevent such crimes, why teens do not fear the consequences associated with crime, and why users don’t understand how their actions online can land them into trouble.
Plus, commentary by former Congressman Jason Chaffetz, host of the Jason in the House podcast.

      <title>Extra: Combating China's Desire Be The World's Dominant Superpower</title>
      <description>There's strong consensus among political and military officials that China is the most comprehensive threat facing the United States today. 

The two nations' relationship has been deteriorating for many years, and tensions only escalated after a Chinese spy balloon was spotted flying across the U.S. earlier this year. 

During his trip to Beijing last month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese representatives agreed to stabilize the ties between both countries and maintain better communication. 

Retired Four-Star General, Chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, and FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keane recently joined host Dave Anthony to explain how China continues to try and become the dominant world power, and the tactics they're using to undermine us.

Gen. Keane also discussed the likelihood China would go to war with Taiwan in the near future, how the U.S. could respond, and the national security implications of China's presence in the Indo-Pacific.

Due to time limitations, we could not include the entire conversation in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear our entire unedited interview with FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keane and learn more about our volatile relationships with China and how America can continue to remain the world's most dominant power.

      <description>Turmoil continues in Eastern Europe as Russia’s war on Ukraine enters the summer. The Biden administration has insisted upon its unwavering support for Ukraine, but a growing number of Republicans running for the White House have called into question how long the United States can continue to aid the nation in its fight against Russia. FOX News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar joins to discuss the 2024 candidates’ positions on the war, why the Republican field has varying stances on further aid to Ukraine, and how foreign policy can factor into who becomes the Republican nominee for President.
 
The United States of America turns 247 years old this Fourth of July. The country has a history of unique traditions from fireworks to concerts, and pomp and parade, many gather in Washington D.C. to celebrate the nation's independence.  FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram joins to talk about the Capitol's traditions, why Independence Day was not considered a federal holiday until the 1930s, and debates why we should celebrate on July 2nd, not July 4th.

      <title>Extra: Larry Kudlow Breaks Down "Bidenomics"</title>
      <description>President Joe Biden spent the past week touting his economic accomplishments and selling what has been dubbed "Bidenomics."
However, some of his critics believe the President's math doesn't add up and the White House's so-called achievements aren't all that impressive.
Larry Kudlow, host of 'Kudlow' on FOX Business, joined host Dave Anthony to share his concerns with the economy and why he questions Biden's handling of it.
Kudlow, who in 2018 then-President Donald Trump appointed to be Director of the National Economic Council, also weighed in how the Fed is handling inflation and what economic message the 2024 candidates should have as they hit the campaign trail.
Due to time limitations, we could not include the entire conversation in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear our entire unedited interview with FOX Business' Larry Kudlow and learn more of his take on the state of the economy and "Bidenomics."

      <title>From Washington: Will "Bidenomics" Persuade Voters?</title>
      <description>As President Biden makes the case for his re-election, one major hurdle he faces is easing voters' concerns about the economy. During a speech on Wednesday, the president touted "Bidenomics" by pointing to various projects and investments in an attempt to convince Americans that his policies are working. A FOX News Poll this week reflected the nation's skepticism, finding that 60% of Americans disapprove of President Biden's handling of the economy. Chairman and CEO of UBS Americas and Founder of 32 Advisors Robert Wolf describes how President Biden's economic messaging is resonating with voters and what challenges the administration faces. Later, he explains what more the president must do in order to execute his economic legislative wins.

As the Supreme Court leaves the bench for its summer recess, major rulings have caused yet again another uproar amongst American citizens after reversing affirmative action which put an end to race-conscious college admissions. Additionally, the Justices ruled 6-3 in favor of a Christian web designer who refused to design same-sex wedding websites as well as striking down the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness plan. Vice President of Domestic Policy and The Joseph C. and Elizabeth A. Anderlik Fellow at the Heritage Foundation Roger Severino shares his perspective on the Court's decisions and why he believes they got it right this time.

      <itunes:summary>As President Biden makes the case for his re-election, one major hurdle he faces is easing voters' concerns about the economy. During a speech on Wednesday, the president touted "Bidenomics" by pointing to various projects and investments in an attempt to convince Americans that his policies are working. A FOX News Poll this week reflected the nation's skepticism, finding that 60% of Americans disapprove of President Biden's handling of the economy. Chairman and CEO of UBS Americas and Founder of 32 Advisors Robert Wolf describes how President Biden's economic messaging is resonating with voters and what challenges the administration faces. Later, he explains what more the president must do in order to execute his economic legislative wins.

As the Supreme Court leaves the bench for its summer recess, major rulings have caused yet again another uproar amongst American citizens after reversing affirmative action which put an end to race-conscious college admissions. Additionally, the Justices ruled 6-3 in favor of a Christian web designer who refused to design same-sex wedding websites as well as striking down the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness plan. Vice President of Domestic Policy and The Joseph C. and Elizabeth A. Anderlik Fellow at the Heritage Foundation Roger Severino shares his perspective on the Court's decisions and why he believes they got it right this time.

      <title>Evening Edition: Supreme Court Blocks President Biden's Debt Forgiveness Plan</title>
      <description>On Friday morning, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to overturn the Biden administration's student loan debt forgiveness program, with the majority explaining that the HEROES Act did not give President Biden the authority to cancel student debt for millions of Americans. The decision will have serious economic impacts for borrowers who will soon have to resume their payments in October with accumulated interest. Alan Collinge borrowed $30,000 to get his PhD in aerospace engineering and later found himself owing upwards of $100,000. Now author and founder of StudentLoanJustice.org, Allan joins the podcast to discuss his reaction to the decision, why he doubted the Biden administration was serious about this forgiveness program, and possible solutions to help borrowers with high, outstanding debt.

      <title>Supreme Court Ends Affirmative Action At U.S. Colleges</title>
      <description>The Supreme Court has ruled to overturn affirmative action in college admissions, ending universities' decades-old ability to make race a deciding factor in the admissions process. Six justices voted against such programs, calling them a violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the Constitution. Conservatives have celebrated this court decision as a major victory as Democrats criticize the result, with President Biden calling the decision a "severe disappointment." FOX News Sunday Host Shannon Bream joins the Rundown live from Capitol Hill to discuss what factors led the court to make this ruling, how colleges could potentially try to circumvent the affirmative action decision, and the impact this may have on diversity in America's higher education system.

The Canadian wildfires continue to wreak havoc on the United States, with the heavy smoke causing several American cities to be rated in the top ten for worst air quality. Approximately 100 million people from the Midwest to the Carolinas are experiencing severe air quality alerts and are advised to limit their time outside. The CDC warns that wildfire smoke carries particulate matter, which can travel into the lung tissue and cause a number of respiratory illnesses. FOX News Senior Meteorologist, Janice Dean, joins to talk about the risks the smokey air poses to at-risk individuals, how the air quality will affect summer travel and activities, and why the severe heat wave in the south is more dangerous than people care to believe.

Plus, commentary by Fox &amp; Friends co-host and host of The Brian Kilmeade Show, Brian Kilmeade.

      <title>Evening Edition: Is Americans' TikTok Data Secure? New Reports Suggest Maybe Not</title>
      <description>When TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew testified before Congress, he assured lawmakers with national security concerns that "American data is stored on American soil" and not in China. Recently, news broke revealing that some creators' personal and financial data was indeed being stored on servers in China, where the Chinese Communist Party could access it. Now, senators and representatives on Capitol Hill remain skeptical of the national security risks posed by TikTok and are weighing whether its CEO committed perjury in his hearing testimony. Eben Brown speaks to Fox Business' Grady Trimble about the contradictions in Chew's testimony, whether the company is being completely forthcoming about how they manage user data, and the feasibility of a national TikTok ban.

      <title>"Another Federal Screw Up": America’s Latest Travel Nightmare</title>
      <description>Earlier this week travelers were left scrambling in airports across the country as weather delays and staff shortages left many unable to make it to their destinations. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says to expect major delays during the holiday weekend as it is projected to be the busiest day for air travel since the start of the pandemic. Michael Boyd, President &amp; CEO of Boyd Group International Group, joins the Rundown to discuss why airlines are continuing to face major meltdowns, the technical impacts that 5G cell towers will have on airplanes, and why the government continues to ignore concerns presented by airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration.

President Biden has been touting his economic accomplishments on the road, saying, "Made in America is not a slogan. It's actually happening." This is a policy priority that President Biden and former President Trump actually agree on, but they do disagree on who has had more success bringing key factories and products like semiconductor chips back to the United States. Right now, the nation's main manufacturing competitor is China--a country with whom the U.S. has had tense relations recently. Former President Trump's U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer joins the Rundown to explain how allowing China to heavily profit from U.S. business is weakening America, why we must 'strategically decouple' from China carefully to avoid negative impacts on the economy, and the reasons he's a strong supporter of the CHIPS and Science Act.

Plus, commentary by Fox News contributor Liz Peek.

      <title>Evening Edition: IRS Whistleblower Alleges Political Influence In Hunter Biden Probe</title>
      <description>Internal Revenue Service whistleblower Gary Shapley has alleged that Hunter Biden received special treatment that allowed the investigation into his finances to be placed "on the back burner" as the 2020 election grew closer. In his recently released interview with Special Report's Bret Baier, Shapley claimed that Trump-appointed U.S. attorney David Weiss told him that he was not truly in charge of the investigation--this conflicts with what U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has repeatedly stated for months. Fox News Justice Correspondent David Spunt joins the podcast to explain the whistleblower's allegations about political influence on Hunter's case, AG Merrick Garland's steadfast assertions on the matter, and what House Republicans are likely to do with these new claims from whistleblowers.

      <title>President Takes “Bidenomics” On The Road</title>
      <description>President Joe Biden set out to tout his economic accomplishments on Wednesday in Chicago, dubbing his plan "Bidenomics." He explains that the strategy will focus on expanding the middle class by growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up in an effort to shift away from trickle-down economics. The administration claims that 13 million jobs have been created since the start of his term; however, the unemployment rate reached a high of 3.7 percent—the highest unemployment numbers since the start of the pandemic. Larry Kudlow, host of ‘Kudlow’ on FOX Business, joins the podcast to share why Biden's approach may not help him in the 2024 election as his approval rating decreases and explains what Republican candidates need to do to gain economic leverage as many voters are still feeling the squeeze of inflation.


As Republican candidates descend on Iowa and New Hampshire to campaign for the nomination, the Fox News Power Rankings for 2024 have been released. Ahead of a crowded GOP primary race and a consequential presidential election, this election analysis tool gives people model-driven projections about hotly contested races to watch and insight into the current state of America’s political landscape.

      <itunes:summary>President Joe Biden set out to tout his economic accomplishments on Wednesday in Chicago, dubbing his plan "Bidenomics." He explains that the strategy will focus on expanding the middle class by growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up in an effort to shift away from trickle-down economics. The administration claims that 13 million jobs have been created since the start of his term; however, the unemployment rate reached a high of 3.7 percent—the highest unemployment numbers since the start of the pandemic. Larry Kudlow, host of ‘Kudlow’ on FOX Business, joins the podcast to share why Biden's approach may not help him in the 2024 election as his approval rating decreases and explains what Republican candidates need to do to gain economic leverage as many voters are still feeling the squeeze of inflation.

      <title>Evening Edition: New Report Reveals "Gross Negligence" Led To Epstein’s Prison Death</title>
      <description>In the Justice Department Inspector General's report released Tuesday, it was revealed that the jail holding convicted sex trafficker and financier Jeffrey Epstein was plagued with significant negligence and misconduct issues that ultimately allowed Epstein to commit suicide while imprisoned. While ruled a suicide by the FBI, the report aimed to further understand the systematic issues that led a powerful prisoner on suicide watch to gain the opportunity and materials to kill themselves. Fox News Senior National Correspondent Rich Edson joins the podcast to explain the revelations in the IG's report, how "gross negligence" at Manhattan Correctional Complex led to Epstein's suicide, and why the suspicions around the circumstances of his death are not likely to go away after this report.

      <title>Fmr. Congressman Will Hurd: 'It’s Time To Rethink Our Russia Strategy'</title>
      <description>Russia saw an attempted mutiny over the weekend when Wagner Group mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin marched an armed convoy on Moscow and seized control of the city of Rostov. The mercenary chief halted his advance, and a truce deal was formed. However, many in the U.S. are now speculating if this defiance of Putin suggests his power is weakening in Russia. As these hostilities unfold abroad, 2024 candidates are being questioned about how they would handle difficult foreign policy situations on the national stage. Former Congressman Will Hurd (R-TX) just recently announced his candidacy for president, and he joins the Rundown to discuss why this mutiny should be a catalyst for America reconsidering our Russian foreign policy strategy, his critiques of President Biden, and why education should be a major concern for parents in this country.

Officials say that China is the most comprehensive threat facing the United States today. Although the two nations' relationship has been deteriorating for many years, it has recently been escalated by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022 and the Chinese spy balloon that flew across the U.S. earlier this year. During his trip to Beijing last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese representatives agreed to stabilize the ties between both countries and maintain better communication. Retired 4-star general, Chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, and FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keane joins to showcase how China continues to try and become the dominant world power, how the country would be affected if China went to war with Taiwan, and the national security implications of China's presence in the Indo-Pacific.

Plus, commentary by Jason Rantz, Host of the Jason Rantz Show and author of "What’s Killing America."

      <title>Evening Edition: Was The Wagner Group Uprising A Failure or False Flag?   </title>
      <description>President Vladimir Putin has condemned an apparent uprising by Russia's brutal military force, the Wagner Group, calling it an act of treason but also saying the rebellion would have been easily stopped. The military group's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin and his men, took control of a major southern city in Russia before agreeing to a deal that has apparently sent him to neighboring Belarus and his troops a pass on criminal charges. So, was this just a two day dispute or is there much more to it? FOX's Alex Hogan speaks with Rebekah Koffler, president of ‘Doctrine &amp; Strategy Consulting’, former DIA intelligence officer, and author of ‘Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America’, who says you cannot believe what either Putin or the paramilitary leader Prigozhin has to say about the mutiny.

      <title>Whistleblowers Reveal New Insights Into Hunter Biden Investigation</title>
      <description>Two IRS whistleblowers claim that D.C. U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves and U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland both played a role in actively hampering an investigation into Hunter Biden, according to testimonies released by the House Ways and Means Committee last week. They allege that U.S. Attorney David Weiss attempted to bring charges against Hunter Biden in both Washington, D.C. and California but was denied by Justice Department officials. Though Garland has since come forward denying any allegations of political interference, House Republicans continue to investigate these claims -- with some, such as Texas Senator Ted Cruz, believing this could be grounds to impeach President Biden. On the Rundown, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH) discusses the key takeaways from the whistleblowers' claims and why allegations like these continue to hinder many Americans' faith in the justice system. He also shares his thoughts on House Republicans' continued investigation into COVID origins.
Political divisions in the United States continue to grow, as Democrats and Republicans in Congress experience increased tensions and Americans of differing political parties report having major difficulties engaging in civil discourse with each other. But a recent poll says that 67 percent of Americans say they are sick and tired of the division. In her podcast now available five days a week, Kennedy Saves The World, FOX's Kennedy is having insightful and fascinating conversations with everyone, even people that disagree with her. Kennedy joins the podcast to talk about the direction of her show and how she first became a libertarian. She gives her take on hot-button issues like gender-affirming care for minors, what's wrong with politics today, and the importance of speaking with people with different views than your own.
Plus, commentary by Fox Nation host Tammy Bruce.

      <title>Extra: Who Is Doug Burgum And Why Is He Running For President? He Tells Us.</title>
      <description>North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum is among the many Republicans vying for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, but there's a good chance you never heard of him. 

A recent Quinnipiac University poll says that 9 out of 10 voters don't know who Governor Burgum is. 

But he's not letting low name recognition stop him. The billionaire North Dakota governor has spent $2.9 million on campaign advertisements to get his name out there, spending more than both Florida Governor DeSantis and frontrunner former President Donald Trump. 

Governor Burgum joined the Rundown's Dave Anthony this week to discuss about his campaign.

He talk about his economic and legislative accomplishments, share his campaign strategy, and explain why he is the best alternative to President Joe Biden.

We made edits for time and thought you might like to hear our entire conversations with presidential candidate Gov. Doug Burgum.
  
On the FOX News Rundown, you'll hear our entire unedited conversation with the North Dakota governor.

Governor Burgum joined the Rundown's Dave Anthony this week to discuss about his campaign.

He talk about his economic and legislative accomplishments, share his campaign strategy, and explain why he is the best alternative to President Joe Biden.

      <title>From Washington: Student Loans &amp; The Burden It Leaves On Americans</title>
      <link>https://radio.foxnews.com/2023/06/25/from-washington-student-loans-the-burden-it-leaves-on-americans/</link>
      <description>Higher education in the United States is notoriously expensive, prompting many to take out student loans and accumulate thousands of dollars of debt. The Biden Administration introduced its student debt relief plan last summer, aiming to forgive up to $20,000 in debt for those who qualified. Louisana Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) reintroduced the College Transparency Act in April to provide accurate reporting on student outcomes such as enrollment, completion, and post-college earnings so students can make informed decisions about higher education. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) explains why he feels so strongly about the bill, why he disagrees with President Biden's Student loan repayment agenda, and touches upon why manufacturing jobs are leaving the United States for China.
 
The Supreme Court has several more opinions to release before the current term ends. The remaining rulings can impact student loan repayment, change Congressional districts in several states, and determine whether or not businesses are allowed to refuse service due to their religious beliefs. The court ruled this week that encouraging illegal immigration is not covered under free speech rights and that states do not have the right to sue the Biden administration regarding their immigration enforcement guidelines. FOX News Sunday Anchor, Shannon Bream explains the implications the two rulings have for the future of immigration, previews what could come from the Supreme Court's ruling on student loan forgiveness, and reflects upon the one-year anniversary of the overturning of Roe V. Wade.

      <title>Extra: How Do We Make Russia And Other Nations More Afraid To Take Americans?</title>
      <description>Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich remains in a Russian prison after losing his appeal against the extension of his detention earlier this week.
He will remain in prison ahead of his trial for espionage and is being held at the notorious Lefortovo Prison in Moscow where he
now faces up to 20 years in jail.
But Evan is not the only American who remains a Russian prisoner. For example, former Marine Paul Whelan is still being held under espionage charges, and has been in a prison camp for more than four years.
Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Congressman Michael McCaul joined special guest host FOX News Correspondent Benjamin Hall on the FOX News Rundown this past week to discuss the U.S. government's effort to free Evan and other Americans currently detained wrongfully by Russia.
Benjamin also spoke to the brother of Paul Whelan, David Whelan, about his brother's case and his family's fight to get him home.

      <title>From Washington: Hunter Biden Reaches Plea Deal With Federal Prosecutors</title>
      <description>After a five-year Justice Department investigation, Hunter Biden reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors. On Tuesday, the President's son pleaded guilty to two tax violations, as well as a felony charge for illegal possession of a firearm as a drug user. The plea deal is expected to allow Hunter Biden to avoid any prison time for the charges, leading many critics to argue that he received preferential treatment from investigators. Former South Carolina Congressman and Federal Prosecutor Trey Gowdy explains the charges and punishment Hunter Biden faces and discusses the politicization of the Justice Department. Later, he explains how the Hunter Biden charges could impact the ongoing investigation into the Biden family business dealings.

House members battled to impeach this week on the hill, as Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert (CO-03) took the stand to force a snap vote to impeach President Joe Biden, and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (FL-13) forced another vote to censure California Democrat Adam Schiff. Both of these votes present a challenge for House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, as House rules allow for any member to hold these types of votes without the okay from respective parties. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill on the growing impatience from Republicans surrounding the capability of Democrats in power and explains how this could all affect the Halls of Congress.

      <title>The Fight To Free Americans Detained In Russia</title>
      <description>Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was wrongfully detained in Russia months ago after they accused him of espionage. More bad news followed this week, as Gershkovich lost his appeal to the charges and will now remain imprisoned until August. Fox’s Ben Hall speaks first with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul about the uphill battle the U.S. faces in negotiating the return of Americans like Gershkovich and retired Marine Paul Whelan who are detained in Russia, the weakness of the Biden administration’s negotiations, and what the nation must do instead of prisoner swaps. Later, Ben Hall speaks with the brother of the detained Paul Whelan, David Whelan, about concerns for his brother’s safety and why more must be done to save Paul and Evan, who are suffering in Russian prison.

North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum is among the many Republicans vying for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, but there’s a good chance you didn’t know that. A recent Quinnipiac University poll says that 9 out of 10 voters don't know who Governor Burgum is. The billionaire North Dakota governor has spent $2.9 million on campaign advertisements to get his name out there, spending more than both Florida Governor DeSantis and frontrunner former President Donald Trump. Governor Burgum joins the Rundown to tout his economic accomplishments, share his campaign strategy, and explain why he is the best alternative to Joe Biden.

Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of "Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla."

      <title>Evening Edition: Titanic Sub Crew Lost In "Catastrophic Implosion"</title>
      <description>The passengers of the Titanic submersible are now believed dead after the U.S. Coast Guard found the debris deep in the Atlantic "consistent with a catastrophic implosion of the vessel." OceanGate Expeditions released a statement, expressing condolences to the friends and families of the Titan passengers, Stockton Rush, Shahzada Dawood, Suleman Dawood, Hamish Harding, and Paul-Henri Nargeolet. Tom Maddox of Underwater Forensic Investigators joins the Rundown Evening Edition once more to share his expertise as a member of the 2005 Titanic submarine expedition. He breaks down what may have led to the Titan's catastrophic failure, if the bodies will ever be found, and grieves the loss, calling it "one that we have expected but hoped would not come true."

      <title>High Stakes At The High Court</title>
      <description>The Supreme Court has approximately eighteen more opinions to announce before the current term ends. The rulings could impact student loan payments, redistricting, and change whether or not businesses are allowed to refuse service based on religious beliefs. Law Professor at the University of California at Berkeley and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General, John Yoo, joins the Rundown to explain how the high court's rulings are already impacting the 2024 election, the legal reasoning for why schools shouldn't base their admissions decisions on race, and later touches upon why he suspects the recent ethical scandals plaguing the Supreme Court justices stem from political bias.

Artificial Intelligence can greatly improve our world, but what happens if it gets into the wrong hands? Scam calls have always been an issue; however, now with A.I., scammers can impersonate victims' close family and friends. One victim, Arizona mother Jennifer Destefano, received a call and heard her daughter sobbing on the other end of the line. She was told her daughter had been kidnapped and would be harmed if a hefty ransom wasn't paid. Later, she would learn her daughter was never truly in danger. Destefano joins the podcast to share her story and explain how the traumatic experience has motivated her to advocate for A.I. regulation on Capitol Hill. Later, Heritage Foundation tech policy research associate Jake Denton joins to discuss what guardrails he believes should be placed on A.I. and how the technology will likely shape the future—for better or for worse.

Plus, commentary by FOX News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett.

      <title>Evening Edition: Cities Are Losing Out On Millions In Legal Weed Taxes</title>
      <description>For the past decade, legalizing marijuana has been a massive topic of debate, with lobbyists and advocates drilling down on the idea that state economies were actually missing out on massive tax revenue. In New York, a state that legalized cannabis just two years ago, that theory does not seem to be holding up. Recent reports show New York won't come close to the hundreds of millions in tax revenue that other states generated in their first years following legalization. Fox Business Correspondent Madison Alworth joins the Rundown to explain what is causing New York's first years of its legal weed industry to fail, how illegal marijuana vendors are still thriving post-legalization, and how bureaucratic red tape is giving the illicit markets an upper hand.

      <title>“A Two Tiered Justice System”: Breaking Down The Hunter Biden Plea Deal</title>
      <description>On Tuesday, it was announced President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, would plead guilty to federal tax offenses but would escape prosecution on a separate gun charge in an agreement with the Justice Department. He has been under investigation by the House Oversight Committee since 2018 for his family's foreign business practices, which House Republicans suspect to be international influence-peddling schemes. The deal with the DOJ will spare him a charge of illegally possessing a firearm as a drug user if he agrees to certain conditions. Law Professor at George Washington University, Jonathan Turley, joins the Rundown to break down why he may never face a true felony charge for these offenses, the accusations that this shows the nation is operating a two-tiered justice system, and touches upon former President Donald Trump's trial set for early August.
 
Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his 2024 presidential candidacy two weeks ago in New Hampshire, making sure to take aim at the GOP primaries’ current frontrunner, former President Trump. The 2024 GOP candidates have been facing tough questions about the former President’s indictment; however, now that President Biden’s son Hunter has entered a plea deal on gun and tax charges, many are questioning the impartiality of the Justice Department. Governor Christie joins the Rundown to explain what he makes of the Hunter Biden plea deal and his belief that former President Trump was charged with obstruction fair and square. Later, he explains how he will distinguish himself from the wide GOP primary field, his big campaign ideas, and his plans to make sure President Biden loses in 2024.

      <title>Evening Edition: 'Titanic' Submersible Rescue Becomes A Race Against The Clock</title>
      <description>A tourist submersible carrying five passengers to survey the wreck of the Titanic has gone missing, and with the passengers’ limited oxygen supply depleting with every passing hour, the U.S. Coast Guard has confirmed that the rescue efforts have now become a race against the clock. Tom Maddox of Underwater Forensic Investigators was once a member of the 2005 Titanic submarine expedition, and he recounts how dangerous this voyage can be. He joins the podcast to explain what obstacles rescuers are confronting as they search for the missing vessel, what may have led to OceanGate’s submersible going missing in the first place, and the conditions that the five passengers are likely experiencing as authorities desperately search for clues to their location.

      <title>From Miami Mayor…To Leader Of The Free World?</title>
      <description>Last week, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez announced that he is running for president, officially joining the already crowded GOP field. Although he is considered a longshot according to recent polls, if elected he would not be the first former mayor to make it to the White House. However, he would be the first to make the jump directly from mayor to Commander in Chief. Mayor Suarez joins the Rundown to talk about why Floridians should vote for him over Governor Ron DeSantis, why a Hispanic Republican should be the one to fix the nation’s immigration system and his strategies as he works to make it to the debate stage in August.
President Biden is ramping up re-election efforts, attending several campaign fundraisers during a three-day visit to California. Though it initially seemed he would be the Democratic Party’s obvious nominee choice in 2024, his two challengers, Marianne Williamson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are gaining more traction than most Americans initially expected — specifically Kennedy, who’s touting double digits in many recent polls. Could this mean the Democrats are ready for new leadership, or will President Biden ultimately win his party’s support? Former Deputy National Press Secretary of the Democratic Party Jose Aristimuño joins the Rundown to explain why he’s confident the President will be the Democratic nominee, as there’s little to no chance the DNC will turn against the party’s incumbent. He also shares why he believes Governor Ron DeSantis would pose a bigger threat to Democrats than former President Trump in a 2024 face-off and how he thinks President Biden is sufficiently responding to worries about his age &amp; capabilities if he were to serve a second term.
Plus, commentary by Opinion Editor for The Washington Times Charlie Hurt.

Kennedy Jr., are gaining more traction than most Americans initially expected — specifically Kennedy, who’s touting double digits in many recent polls. Could this mean the Democrats are ready for new leadership, or will President Biden ultimately win his party’s support? Former Deputy National Press Secretary of the Democratic Party Jose Aristimuño joins the Rundown to explain why he’s confident the President will be the Democratic nominee, as there’s little to no chance the DNC will turn against the party’s incumbent. He also shares why he believes Governor Ron DeSantis would pose a bigger threat to Democrats than former President Trump in a 2024 face-off and how he thinks President Biden is sufficiently responding to worries about his age &amp; capabilities if he were to serve a second term.</p><p>Plus, commentary by Opinion Editor for The Washington Times Charlie Hurt.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Rep. Tony Gonzales Talks Secretary Blinken's Trip to China: Productive or Problematic?</title>
      <description>Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in China meeting with some of the country's key leaders this week amidst troubling tensions between the U.S. and China. Republicans have voiced differing opinions on the trip, with some saying it facilitates productive dialogue with China and others believing China should instead send someone to the U.S. if they want to pursue talks. The question also remains if Secretary Blinken will initiate conversations with other nations that China has been working closely with like Cuba, which has allegedly allowed China to establish spy bases in the country since 2019. On the Rundown, Congressman Tony Gonzales (R-TX) joins to explain why U.S. leaders must connect with countries working with our adversaries to establish dominance and strengthen national security. He also discusses how he &amp; his fellow members on the House Homeland Security Committee are working to investigate Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’ alleged failure at securing the border.
 
The Biden administration's Investing in America agenda includes a plan to have 50% of new cars be electric by 2030. Since he took office, electric vehicle sales have tripled, and the number of available charges has increased by 40%. However, the advancement of EVs has hit a few speed bumps along the way. Since 2019, there have been over 700 crashes involving Tesla's self-driving feature, calling into question the effectiveness and safety of its autopilot capabilities. There have also been concerns about how to standardize chargers. FOX News Digital's automotive editor Gary Gastelu joins to discuss the state of the electric vehicle market, where the technology is going, and what's really behind those Tesla accidents.
 
Plus, commentary by former White House speechwriter and Fox News Contributor Marc Thiessen.

      <title>Extra: 'The United States v. Donald Trump'</title>
      <description>Former President Donald Trump was in Miami federal court this week after he was charged with 37 felony counts. 
The felonies he stands accused of involve removing highly classified documents from the White House following the end of his presidency and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them. 

President Trump says he is innocent and is being politically targeted by President Biden's Department of Justice. 

Just before the former President's day in court, George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley joined host Dave Anthony to break down the evidence in the case that could be potentially damaging for the Trump defense team. He also discussed the accusations by Trump allies who feel he is being treated differently than other past Presidents.

Turley explains when a trial could take place, what might happen if the former president is convicted, and how this could become an issue in the 2024 election. 

Due to time limitations, we could not include the entire conversation in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear our entire unedited interview with Constitutional expert Jonathan Turley and get more of his analysis on the unprecedented and historic indictment of Donald Trump.

      <title>From Washington: Congress Not Seeing Eye To Eye On Spending</title>
      <description>A spending disagreement is brewing in Congress as representatives work to vote on twelve appropriations bills before the fiscal year ends in September. Republican lawmakers are demanding even less spending than what they agreed to earlier this month, narrowly avoiding a default on the nation's debt. House Democrats have reacted by raising the prospect of a government shutdown come Fall. FOX's Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the Congressional funding disagreements and the role Congress plays in the indictment of former President Trump. Later, Chad highlights this year's Congressional baseball game.

This July, President Joe Biden, and his NATO counterparts are expected to select a new Secretary-General for the alliance when they meet for a summit in Vilnius, Lithuania. Jens Stoltenberg's term was set to expire last year; however, his tenure was extended after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Stoltenberg says he doesn't plan on seeking another extension but hasn't ruled himself entirely out of the running. FOX News Radio's London Correspondent, Jonathan Savage weighs in on what would happen if a new Secretary-General were not appointed, NATO's defense spending as the war in Ukraine continues and explains the obstacles Sweden faces as Turkey tries to bar the nation from joining the alliance.

      <title>Extra: The "Chinese Century"? Why Sen. Rubio Says Every Part America Is Now In Decline</title>
      <description>Senator Marco Rubio is very worried about America. 

The Florida Republican fears our country has lost all common sense and can no longer solve problems. Something he feels our foes have been taking advantage of. In fact, he even says, "the 21st century will be the 'Chinese century' at our expense."

Senator Rubio recently joined Jessica Rosenthal to discuss these concerns and how they inspired him to write his new book, "Decades of Decadence: How Our Spoiled Elites Blew America's Inheritance of Liberty, Security, and Prosperity."

The Senator blamed misguided elitists and economic policies for sparking the decline of America's global dominance. He says another problem is that American lawmakers in both parties have for decades underestimated China's desire to overtake the U.S. as the world's dominant superpower. 

Due to time limitations, we could not include the entire conversation in the FOX News Rundown segment that ran this week. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear our entire unedited interview with Senator Marco Rubio and learn more about China's influence in Cuba and the Senator's take on the 2024 GOP primary.

      <title>From Washington: Former President Trump Arraigned In Court - What's Next?</title>
      <description>On Tuesday, former President Trump was arraigned in a Miami federal court where he pleaded not guilty to 37 criminal counts related to a classified documents case. This marks the second time the former President has been arraigned following the Manhattan case in which he faced state charges of falsifying business records. Former Manhattan District Attorney Prosecutor Elliot Felig discusses the remarkable nature of the indictment and breaks down the various components of the case. Later, he explains how the case could create legal conflicts for the former President who could potentially face more indictments down the road.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Bejing this week, days after the White House acknowledged the existence of a Chinese surveillance complex in Cuba, despite an initial denial from National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. This was just months after the Pentagon shot down a spy balloon that sailed across the United States. Founder and President of Eurasia Group Ian Bremmer lays out the stakes of Secretary Blinken's trip and what the next several years look like for the relationship between the U.S. and China.

      <itunes:summary>On Tuesday, former President Trump was arraigned in a Miami federal court where he pleaded not guilty to 37 criminal counts related to a classified documents case. This marks the second time the former President has been arraigned following the Manhattan case in which he faced state charges of falsifying business records. Former Manhattan District Attorney Prosecutor Elliot Felig discusses the remarkable nature of the indictment and breaks down the various components of the case. Later, he explains how the case could create legal conflicts for the former President who could potentially face more indictments down the road.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Bejing this week, days after the White House acknowledged the existence of a Chinese surveillance complex in Cuba, despite an initial denial from National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. This was just months after the Pentagon shot down a spy balloon that sailed across the United States. Founder and President of Eurasia Group Ian Bremmer lays out the stakes of Secretary Blinken's trip and what the next several years look like for the relationship between the U.S. and China.

      <title>It Was A Wild Week of Allegations &amp; Indictments. Shannon Bream Breaks It Downs.</title>
      <description>It's been a busy week of indictments and allegations, and FOX News Sunday Anchor Shannon Bream is back this week to break it all down. She discusses the major legal stories making headlines, from former President Donald Trump's indictment and how it could impact the 2024 presidential race, to the charges facing marine veteran Daniel Penny, over the death of a homeless man on a New York City subway, as he awaits his arraignment. She also gives her thoughts on new evidence facing the Biden family's shady business dealings, the remaining Supreme Court case decisions that will likely be made sooner rather than later, and what's been happening outside the U.S. — as China strengthens ties with Cuba to further spy on America.
 
Everyone hates fees. Especially costly hidden ones. That may be why President Joe Biden is taking on “junk fees” and pressuring companies like Ticketmaster and Airbnb to be more transparent about how much they’re charging customers. But how much will this move actually help Americans struggling to pay bills? FOX Business White House Correspondent Edward Lawrence joins the Rundown to discuss junk fees, and why President Biden’s fight for upfront pricing may not bring the relief from debt and inflation many families need.
 
Plus, commentary from comedian and FOX News contributor Tom Shillue.

      <title>Evening Edition: Marine Veteran Indicted For Chokehold Death </title>
      <description>A New York City grand jury has indicted a twenty four year old Marine veteran for putting an aggressive subway rider in a chokehold that led to his death. Daniel Penny was charged with second degree manslaughter for the death of Jordan Neely, a homeless man that was said to be struggling with mental illness. FOX's John Saucier speaks with Jonna Spilbor, defense attorney and FOX News legal analyst, who says this case could set a national precedent for the better or for the worse.

      <title>Unprecedented Indictment Put GOP Primary Candidates On The Hot Seat</title>
      <description>Following former President Trump's federal indictment in Florida, his fellow Republicans vying for the nomination now face a difficult balancing act of how to handle the political fallout. While some candidates in the race have echoed the former president's sentiments that this indictment is a weaponization of the Justice Department, other rival candidates have expressed that the allegations against former President Trump are very serious and reckless for U.S. national security. Co-Anchor of "America Reports," John Roberts, joins the podcast to discuss how other candidates in the GOP nomination race are cautiously navigating the unprecedented political situation and whether this indictment will impact voters' choices ahead of the primaries.

After over a year of defending itself from Russia, Ukraine has recently launched its own counteroffensive, looking for vulnerabilities along the frontlines. The Ukrainian forces have made several successful attempts to retake sections of their territory that were being occupied by Russian forces, but not without a cost. Reports show that multiple Ukrainian tanks have been destroyed since the new warfront began. FOX's Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent, Greg Palkot, joins the Rundown to share how Ukrainians are coping with the realities of war, why we likely will not see the main thrust of counteroffensive strategies until Ukraine implements Western artillery, and he outlines the various ways Russia has continued to attack Ukrainian civilians.

Plus, commentary from Jim Daly, president of Focus on the Family.

      <title>Finally Some Hope For America's Education Problem</title>
      <description>America’s students struggled during the pandemic, as shown by school test scores dropping to record lows nationwide. However, U.S. schools had been struggling even before school closures. For example, in 2013, Mississippi was ranked as the second-worst state for low-income student reading scores. Educators in the state decided to take matters into their own hands, and by 2022, Mississippi saw its rank rise to #2. Teacher and president of the Mississippi Association of Educators, Erica Jones, joins the Rundown to discuss how she and teachers in her state used phonics to revolutionize the old ways schools taught reading, how improved reading skills among students have led to better performances in all subjects, and how other educators and teachers can apply the strategies they're using in Mississippi to see similar positive results.

The United States military is facing a major recruitment issue. As multiple reports have surfaced showing enlistment numbers growing stagnant, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth says it is unlikely that they will meet this year's projection of 65,000 new recruits. In an effort to offset this trend, both the Air Force and the Army are marketing the armed forces to legal immigrants, advertising it as a way to fast-track their citizenship. Retired Army Lieutenant General and Director of the Center for National Defense, Tom Spoehr, joins the podcast to talk about why nearly 70 percent of Americans are ineligible to serve, how the military is pursuing new recruiting tactics, and the correlation between the declining service numbers and the dwindling veteran population.

Plus, commentary from host of OutKick’s Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.

        <![CDATA[<p>America’s students struggled during the pandemic, as shown by school test scores dropping to record lows nationwide. However, U.S. schools had been struggling even before school closures. For example, in 2013, Mississippi was ranked as the second-worst state for low-income student reading scores. Educators in the state decided to take matters into their own hands, and by 2022, Mississippi saw its rank rise to #2. Teacher and president of the Mississippi Association of Educators, Erica Jones, joins the Rundown to discuss how she and teachers in her state used phonics to revolutionize the old ways schools taught reading, how improved reading skills among students have led to better performances in all subjects, and how other educators and teachers can apply the strategies they're using in Mississippi to see similar positive results.</p><p><br></p><p>The United States military is facing a major recruitment issue. As multiple reports have surfaced showing enlistment numbers growing stagnant, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth says it is unlikely that they will meet this year's projection of 65,000 new recruits. In an effort to offset this trend, both the Air Force and the Army are marketing the armed forces to legal immigrants, advertising it as a way to fast-track their citizenship. Retired Army Lieutenant General and Director of the Center for National Defense, Tom Spoehr, joins the podcast to talk about why nearly 70 percent of Americans are ineligible to serve, how the military is pursuing new recruiting tactics, and the correlation between the declining service numbers and the dwindling veteran population.</p><p><br></p><p>Plus, commentary from host of OutKick’s Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Former President Trump Returns To Court</title>
      <description>Former President Donald Trump is in Florida to face his arraignment after he was federally indicted on 37 counts. The felonies he stands accused of involve removing highly classified documents from the White House following the end of his presidency and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them. It was just in March that the former president was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury for falsifying New York business records in order to conceal damaging information from voters during the 2016 election. George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley joins the podcast to break down the evidence in the case that could be potentially damaging for the Trump defense team. He explains what might happen if the former president is convicted and how this could become an issue in the 2024 election.


Within the past week, reports surfaced that China was seeking to establish a new eavesdropping facility in Cuba. These reports were originally labeled inaccurate by the White House; however, over the weekend, additional reporting confirmed that this Chinese spy base in Cuba actually already existed and had been operating since 2019. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) joins the Rundown to discuss how the problematic relationship between China and Cuba is a top foreign policy concern and why the Biden administration must act to combat the national security threat. He also goes further in-depth on how China is trying to outpace America as a world power and talks about his new book, ‘Decades of Decadence," which analyzes the actions Rubio asserts have left the US "on the brink of a cultural and economic crisis."


Plus, commentary from FOX News contributor and founder of Golden Together, Steve Hilton.
