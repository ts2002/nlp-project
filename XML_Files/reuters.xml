      <title>UN on Hamas rape charges, Super Tuesday and Haiti’s gangs</title>
      <description>UN experts say it’s likely that rape and gang rape occurred during the Hamas raids in Israel on October 7.

In Haiti a state of emergency has been declared as criminal gangs try to topple the prime minister. And the mystery of a stolen Ferrari is solved ... 30 years later.

      <title>Moon landing, Nvidia frenzy, ‘The Trump whisperer’ at NATO and Alabama embryo ruling</title>
      <description>The United States has achieved its first moon landing in half a century with a private spacecraft. AI mania has added a whopping $277 billion to Nvidia’s market value. Outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, known as ‘The Trump whisperer’ for his skill in handling the then US president at a NATO summit in 2018, is in pole position to be the next head of the alliance. And in the wake of Alabama’s embryo ruling, a woman in that state tells us she wants to move her three frozen embryos out of the country.

      <title>Ukraine’s Starlink claims, Israel-Lebanon truce proposal, super sneakers and driverless cars</title>
      <description>Ukraine has said Russian forces are buying Starlink terminals in “Arab countries” for use on the battlefield. France has called for Hezbollah to withdraw 6 miles from the border with Israel as part of a proposal to end hostilities at the Lebanon-Israel frontier. Kelvin Kiptum was targeting marathon history before his death. But the shoe technology now driving the sport means someone else will break the two-hour barrier. Plus, San Francisco’s Waymo arson attack sparks fresh debate over self-driving cars.

      <description>Trump and Haley are sharpening their attacks as the New Hampshire primary approaches. But after Trump's big win in Iowa, is it all over?

Political correspondents James Oliphant, Gram Slattery and Jarrett Renshaw join the podcast to preview Tuesday's primary, unpack Trump's strategy of campaigning from his court appearances and speak with Biden's sole Democratic challenger.
*This podcast was updated after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced he was dropping out of the Republican presidential primary. A reference to DeSantis being in the race has been removed.

      <title>US Houthi strikes, Iran’s tanker seizure, Britain’s Post Office and the Emmys</title>
      <description>The US and Britain have launched strikes from the air and sea against Houthi military targets in Yemen. Iran says it has seized a tanker in retaliation for the confiscation last year of the same vessel by the US. A TV drama exposes one of Britain's biggest miscarriages of justice – at the Post Office. The Emmys are back – the same night as the Iowa caucuses. Plus, all the gadgets at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
Listen to our special episode on Taiwan's elections here.
*This episode was updated. A headline about Donald Trump tangling with the judge in his civil fraud trial was removed due to it incorrectly referring to New York Attorney General Letitia James as the US attorney general.

      <title>Israel in Syria, Biden’s Austin problem and the price hit from Red Sea attacks</title>
      <description>Israel is unleashing deadlier, more frequent, air raids against Iran-linked targets in Syria. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s failure to disclose his hospitalizations is creating a political headache for Joe Biden. Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea is likely to push up prices for consumers. Plus, with less than a week to go before the first primary of the 2024 presidential race, the top three Republican contenders are intensifying attacks on one another.

      <title> Zelenskiy’s double whammy, US election prep and breakdancing at the Olympics </title>
      <description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is on a last-ditch lobbying trip to Washington this week. With talks on US aid for the war stalled in Congress, he’s meeting with lawmakers and President Joe Biden. But Zelenskiy is also facing a funding battle in Europe. Groups across the U.S. political spectrum prepare for threats to the democratic process in 2024. As breakdancing makes its Olympics debut, Adidas seeks to capitalise on a new generation of sports. Plus, the latest from Gaza and a bid for Macy’s.

      <title>The Crown, the cabinet and the UK's legacy of slavery </title>
      <description>At the start of the 19th century, a British politician named George Smith grew rich from slavery. Two centuries later, one of his descendants is Britain's newly anointed king. Another holds the keys to the nation’s Treasury and would oversee any future reparations. In this special podcast we look at how these links were investigated, we visit Jamaica to the site of a former plantation and speak to experts about why calls for a formal apology and reparations over slavery continue.
Hear our previous podcast about America's slavery legacy in which we follow two Reuters journalists on their personal journeys to confront family connections with slavery. Plus, the investigation into more than 100 lawmakers with slaveholding ancestors.

      <title>Gaza departures, back to the Taliban and Arab American votes in key states</title>
      <description>Limited evacuations from Gaza have been agreed as fighting intensifies. Israel said its fighter jets killed a Hamas commander in a strike on a densely populated refugee camp. The Biden administration's support of Israel’s offensive lands him in trouble with Arab American voters in key states. Plus thousands of Afghans forced back into Taliban rule and the where the illegal wildlife goes in California.

      <title>What Israel faces in Hamas’ tunnels</title>
      <description>This special episode is an extended interview with correspondent Jonathan Saul and host Kim Vinnell. Together, they explore Hamas' tunnel network under Gaza. Hundreds of miles long and up to 80 yards deep, it's described as the "Viet Cong times 10" by one Israeli security source. Jonathan reports on what we know so far about Israel's strategy to combat Hamas in the network one freed hostage has described as a spider's web.

      <title>Biden's Israel stand. Plus, the blame game and fury over hospital blast</title>
      <description>Joe Biden, in Israel, pledged solidarity in its war against Hamas and said that a blast that killed huge numbers of Palestinians appeared to have been caused not by Israel but by its foes. The president's rare war time trip was supposed to be a diplomatic mission in the region to stop the war widening, but the hospital blast just hours before he arrived -- and an ensuing blame game -- had Arab leaders pull out.
*The podcast incorrectly referred to Benjamin Netanyahu as the president of Israel. It was updated to reflect that he is the prime minister.

      <title>Rafah, Blinken's diplomacy and tributes to a Reuters journalist</title>
      <description>We're at the Rafah border crossing as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says it will re-open to let foreign passport holders out of Gaza, and much needed aid to flow in. But Benjamin Netanyahu's office says there's no ceasefire to allow for that. Energy markets are nervy after threats by Iran. Issam Abdallah is laid to rest in his hometown in Lebanon. Plus, the latest after critical votes in Poland, Ecuador, Australia and New Zealand.

      <title>Ukraine wobbles, 40 days after Wagner death and SBF's trial</title>

The trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried begins this week, as does Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial.

      <title>Russia’s jail ‘carousel’, Australia hit by misinformation, Ukraine war divides the G20</title>
      <description>Australia’s upcoming referendum on Indigenous rights finds itself the target of online misinformation. And experts say it’s working. Human rights lawyers say Russia is repeatedly arresting and releasing some people for minor offenses as a tool to quell dissent against the conflict in Ukriane. And leaders of the world's richest countries are heading to New Delhi for the G20 summit - without Xi or Putin.

      <title>Weekend episode: Stagnating Germany – can Europe’s biggest economy snap out of it?</title>
      <description>It’s Europe’s biggest economy – so how worried should people be about Germany’s stagnation? We look at what’s pummelling the country’s economy – and how a Nazi-era bunker-turned-penthouse has become emblematic of its property market woes. Plus, government plans to legalize cannabis have weed smokers on a high.
*This podcast was corrected. An earlier version said the amount of time it takes to open a business in Germany is double the EU average. The correct statistic is that the time it takes to obtain a license to open a business in Germany is double the OECD average. The incorrect line was removed.

      <title>Hilary hits California, Russia fails but moon race goes on and Ukraine dusts off old tanks</title>
      <description>Tropical storm Hilary has lashed southern California with flash floods, prompting some to flee. Russia’s first lunar mission in 47 years ended in failure. But the new space race is still on, with India set to make an attempt this week. Ukraine welcomes mothballed Leopard 1 tanks due to low supplies of newer equipment. Plus, China’s workers turn to driving for ride-hailing apps – making it more difficult for longstanding drivers to make ends meet.

      <title>Weekend episode: Afghans in limbo two years on, and we remember Danish Siddiqui</title>
      <description>It's been two years since the Taliban took back Afghanistan. Yet, many of the Afghans who worked for U.S. organizations during the 20-year war are still left waiting for visas. We visit with one family waiting for visas in Pakistan, and examine the photographic legacy of our colleague Danish Siddiqui, who was killed while covering a clash between Afghan Special Forces and the Taliban in Kandahar.

      <title>Pakistan church violence, Israel-Lebanon border tensions and a divided Fed</title>
      <description>Increasing tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border have elevated the risk of outright conflict. A standoff in Pakistan as troops guard a church from mob violence over claims a Koran was desecrated. Fed minutes show division on further rate increases as the battle against inflation continues. Officials defend not using the siren alert system in Maui -- and Europe’s environmental ambitions face a ‘greenlash’.

      <title>Spain’s fugitive kingmaker, a striking Israel reservist and Musk’s risky X factor</title>
      <description>“Major E” served in Israel’s army for 13 years – but today he’s one of the reservists on strike to protest the judicial reforms ripping the country apart. A fugitive separatist leader could determine whether or not Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez holds on to power. Plus, the risks for Elon Musk’s ‘X’ and inside the delicate negotiations over the missing US soldier.
*This podcast was corrected. An earlier version incorrectly referred to the Junts party as the organizers of the banned Catalonia independence referendum in 2017. It was organized by PDeCAT, another pro-independence party at the time led by Carles Puigdemont.

Plus, tourists to Europe are considering new itineraries as traditional hot spots such as Italy and Spain are becoming too, well, hot. And the race to perfect the AI assistant.

      <title>Wagner group’s Africa dealings and raids in Europe’s new pot capital</title>

      <title> Special episode: Pride and prejudice – LGBTQ+ around the world</title>
      <description>It’s Pride month – which can mean big parties and big protests. But elsewhere in the world, members of the LGBTQ+ community fear to do either as repercussions for visibility are great. In this special episode, we look at LGBTQ+ reality around the world, from the restrictive laws of Uganda to the Pride marches for peace in Cyprus.

      <title>El Nino threatens more wildfires and Germany’s far-right surge</title>
      <description>It’s Canada’s worst ever start to wildfire season – we look at how El Nino’s hot, dry conditions could make matters worse. In Germany, the country's most successful far-right party since the Nazis are surging on an anti-immigration, anti-green agenda. Plus, the unions fighting in Long Beach to make sure zero-emissions do not equal lost jobs.
**Please note episode updated to clarify that Long Beach is aiming to have the world’s first zero-emissions terminal, not be the world's first zero-emissions port.

      <title>What's the G7 to do about China?</title>
      <description>President Joe Biden wants to send a tough message to Beijing from this year’s G7 summit. But China’s trade ties with other G7 countries are complicating Biden’s goal. Japan’s hopes for concrete action on nuclear disarmament also look out of reach as countries stock up on missiles and warheads. We hear from disillusioned atomic bomb survivors and visit an arms factory in South Korea to see firsthand the business of war.

      <title>Assad in Saudi to talk drugs and money</title>
      <description>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is in Saudi Arabia to attend the Arab League summit. His appearance seals his return to the regional fold after years of civil war.

G7 leaders are set to unveil new sanctions against Russia and welcome Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at a summit in Hiroshima. Plus, Greek politicians vie for struggling youth vote, New York pitches for the World Cup 2026 final and debunking misinformation at the U.S./Mexico border.

      <title>Assad in from the cold and Ukraine’s religious war</title>
      <description>Arab nations welcome Syria back into the fold. But will the diplomatic victory for President Bashar al-Assad make any difference to Syrians reeling from years of conflict? Rural communities in Ukraine are divided as Kyiv cracks down on priests it says are loyal to Russia. Moscow steps up attacks on Ukraine ahead of Victory Day holiday. And after the royal jubilation in Britain, anti-monarchists say the police crackdown on protests will only strengthen their cause. Plus a dire warning from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

      <title>Why Chinese migrants are arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border</title>
      <description>This special weekend episode is all about China.
Meet the new migrants making the arduous trek over the Mexico-U.S. border. We talk with those who have left China and find out how they arrived on the Darien Gap.
Plus a hot new trend seizes the young and unemployed – Buddhist devotion. But is it religious resurgence, or a novel way to find a job?
Plus we find out how Beijing is responding to a declining birth rate by easing restrictions on single women.

      <title>Abortion drug battle and the U.S. government mole hunt</title>
      <description>We break down the legal tussle over the abortion drug Mifepristone. What happens next now that a federal judge has suspended FDA approval of the drug? What are U.S. security services most concerned about in the leak of intel documents? And why neither Taiwan nor China has it in their best interest for conflict to break out.

*This episode was updated to correctly refer to the fact that the Biden administration is seeking to block a Texas judge's ruling on mifepristone (not that they have blocked it).

      <title>DeSantis’ foreign policy problem and a kiss made in China</title>
      <description>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wants to be a winner but does his lack of foreign policy expertise hold him back in 2024? India's parliament disqualifies opposition party leader Rahul Gandhi as a lawmaker after a court sentences him to two years in prison. We talk about a new product that’s helping long-distance couples bridge the kissing gap, and the dangers of AI-generated images in photojournalism. And the latest rulings from the World Athletics Council on trans athletes and testosterone in sports.

*The episode was corrected to say that a Manhattan grand jury did not meet Thursday (rather than didn’t yet take up the case).

      <description>We're in Turkey and Syria as hopes fade of finding survivors in the rubble and the clamor for aid crescendos. Against a backdrop of politics and bitter civil war, how will the governments of Tayyip Erdogan and Bashar Assad respond?

Plus our reporter sits down with Jamie Dimon in Miami to talk interest rates and the flight of rich Wall Streeters from his hometown.
