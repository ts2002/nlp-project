      <title>The Sunday Story: Answering Your Questions About Electric Vehicles</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This week the EPA released new rules for vehicle emissions, which will push the auto industry to speed up the transition to electric vehicles.

      <title>The Sunday Story: The Diaspora's Troubled African Dream</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the sleepy town of Asebu, a few miles inland from the Atlantic along Ghana's Cape Coast, a serene 5,000 acre rural settlement is rising out of the palm forests and farmland. <br/><br/>Pan-African Village is envisioned  as an idyllic haven for settlers from the African diaspora. It  was established in 2019, after a  local chief announced that anyone from the diaspora could have plots for free. Hundreds of people, largely from North America and the Caribbean, have accepted the offer and are in the midst of building large homes. <br/><br/>They regard themselves as the first wave of settlers, carving a new life in their ancestral homeland, devoid of racism and repression. But while locals have tentatively welcomed returning diaspora, Ghana is also experiencing some of the worst economic conditions in decades. In Pan-African Village, brewing tensions over ownership and privileged access to the land are threatening to spill over into violence and unravel the promise of  this diaspora haven. <br/><br/>This week on <em>The Sunday Story</em>, producer Andrew Mambo speaks with Emmanuel Akinwotu, NPR's West Africa Correspondent, about the complicated relationship between the diaspora settlers and the place  they see as their ancestral home.<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>Ukrainian City Falls, Israel's Rafah Plans, Texas Steps Up Border Operation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Russia has taken control of a frontline city in Ukraine only days before the war's second anniversary. With supplies running low, will Ukraine's defense forces be able to withstand a Russian assault? Despite international pressure, Israel seems set on a ground invasion of Rafah. Its stated goal is to destroy Hamas, but the city is filled with over a million displaced civilians searching for safety. And Texas plans to build a new military base in the border city of Eagle Pass. It's the latest escalation in the immigration fight between Texas and the federal government. <br/><br/><em>Want more comprehensive analysis of the most important news of the day, plus a little fun?</em><a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/news"><em> Subscribe</em></a><em> to the Up First newsletter. </em><br/><br/><em>Today's episode of Up First was edited by Andrew Sussman, Mark Katkov, Denice Rios and HJ Mai.
