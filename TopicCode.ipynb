What makes our moment rare is a freedom of democracy, a rendered attack at both at home and overseas at the very same time. Plus the US military plans to construct a pier off the coast of Gaza to speed the flow of humanitarian aid. And on International Women's Day we'll look at how cuts to government spending threaten progress on gender equality. It's Friday, March 8th. Drawing sharp contrasts with congressional Republicans and with Donald Trump, President Biden used last night's state of the Union address to warn Americans that their freedoms are at risk at home and that America's adversaries are on the march overseas. With several Supreme Court justices looking on, Biden confronted the court over its 2022 decision to eliminate the right to an abortion, invoking an issue that has succeeded in driving Democrats to the polls. Those bragging about overturning the road we would have no clue about the power of women, but they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot, we won in 2022 and 2020 and we'll win again in 2024. Standing in the House of Representatives, Biden also referenced the January 6th 2021 Capitol riot, accusing Republicans of undermining US democracy with false claims of election fraud and telling them that you can't love our country only when you win. Turning abroad, Biden urged members of Congress to back another round of military aid for Ukraine. That could hinge on Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson bringing up a Senate approved aid package for a vote, something that he says he won't be pressured into doing given its omission of certain border security measures. Without naming Johnson, who was seated behind him, Biden criticized Republicans for backing away from a border deal negotiated by the White House and bipartisan lawmakers only after Trump came out against it. The result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security forms we've ever seen. Oh, you don't think so? Oh, you don't like that bill, huh? That conservatives got together and said it was a good bill? I'll be darned. That's amazing. Well, another of the night's most memorable moments also centered on immigration when Biden was interrupted by Georgia Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who raised the name of nursing student Laken Riley, who was killed late last month, allegedly by an immigrant who police say entered the country illegally. Challenge to say her name Biden held up a pin with her name on it described her as having been killed by a quote illegal and said that he empathized with her parents having lost children himself. Damian Paleta is the journal's Washington coverage chief. This is something that Republicans have been kind of pushing him to do and he did. So I think in a way it showed that he was not trying to run away from this issue. He was not trying to run away from some of the problems caused by the border crisis, but he's asking them to help with solutions. Now whether it's going to be enough, whether it's too little too late, it'll take some time to tell. But the way that he kind of departed from his prepare remarks and made that gesture, I think that was something that we might be talking about months from now when we're trying to look back at this issue. In the Republican response to the state of the Union, freshman Alabama Senator Katie Britt criticized Biden's age and called his performance that of a permanent politician who'd been in office for longer than she had been alive. Britt went on to call Biden's action on illegal immigration insufficient and said Republicans strongly support access to in vitro fertilization. The latest evidence of GOP lawmakers scrambling to reassure voters that the procedure in contrast to abortion has the full support of the party. In a key state of the Union policy announcement, President Biden has said the US military plans to install a temporary peer off the coast of the Gaza Strip for cargo ships to unload essential aid. The president has been under pressure to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza, where the Israeli military is fighting the Hamas militant group. But his journal correspondent, Sooner-Raspussen, told us it's unclear just how much of an impact the US plans will have. The idea is to transport aid from Cyprus on ships to Gaza, where they will then erect this temporary peer floating in the water. The aid will be screened by Israel in Cyprus and the Israeli ship is ultimately meant to accompany the aid as it travels towards Gaza to ensure that no weapons or other materials that could benefit Hamas are delivered with the aid. Once the aid arrives at the peer, it will have to be transported by land to the people in need. And we don't know how those aid deliveries will be secured. There's been the wide-scale collapse of law and order. President Biden has said that he is not going to put American troops on the ground and US officials say that they are in conversations with the UN about how to secure these aid deliveries. But it is unclear how that will actually happen. According to US officials, one shipment will provide roughly 200 truckloads of aid, a far cry from the 500 truckloads of aid that Gaza received on a daily basis prior to the war. A house panel has approved plans to force TikTok's Chinese owner to sell the video sharing app or face an outright ban across the US. TikTok had urged its users to call Congress in an attempt to drop the bill with house staffers across the Capitol during hours of non-stop phone calls. But those efforts backfired with the house now expected to hold a floor vote on the bill. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has called TikTok a grave threat to US national security, while a company spokesperson has said the legislation would deny the 170 million American users of the app their constitutional right to free expression. Boeing is overhauling employee bonuses in order to emphasize quality and safety over meeting financial targets. According to a company memo, safety and quality metrics will now account for 60% of annual bonuses in Boeing's commercial unit. It comes in response to production problems identified as a cause of the doorplug blowout on an Alaska air flight in January. At the same time, Boeing will today begin contract negotiations with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union for the first time in 16 years. The Union is seeking a 40% wage increase, the return of a defined benefit pension and a commitment from Boeing that the next new jet will be produced by its own. And today's US Jobs Report is set to cap a blockbuster week for economic data. Investors have already been dissecting Fed Chair Jerome Powell's congressional testimony, and today's non-farm payrolls data will provide further clues on where the US economy is headed and what that means for the Fed's rate plans. Eric Wallerstein covers global macro economics for the journal and he says that traders have become a lot more focused on data points like the Jobs Report in recent months. At some point this year, if you see a weaker non-farm payrolls print which shows some loosening or some cooling of the labor market, traders would definitely say, interest rates are coming down, you know, I'm going to buy bonds expecting yields to fall during this cycle where the Fed's been tightening policy. We've seen traders up to six hours ahead of an economic data print starting to trade treasury futures. So it's definitely a shift from years prior where maybe there'd be an half hour or an hour before the data traders would start trading. So it really just speaks to how focused investors are on the Fed that said we're very data dependent. Our future policy decisions are going to depend on all the incoming data. Coming up as governments around the world pull back on spending, we'll look at how those cuts disproportionately affect women. That story and more after the break. Hey, what's news fans? Listen up. But that's not all. So we know they definitely have something for you. And it's already included in your prime membership. That's Amazon dot com slash what's news? It's just that easy. The United Nations is marking this year's International Women's Day today by calling on countries to invest in women. I mean, what they say is a $360 billion annual spending deficit on gender equality measures. And as governments tighten their belts, they warn that austerity policies could disproportionately hurt women and potentially put targets to achieve gender equality by the end of the decade out of reach. To address that, the UN is calling for the implementation of gender responsive financing and here to explain what that is and why it may be necessary. I'm joined by Bill Gates, Airtown, an associate professor of economics and international affairs at Northeastern University. Bill Gates, the UN is citing a recent estimate that 75% of countries around the world are likely to curb public spending by the year 2025 with the reasons for that being conflict as well as rising costs for everything from food to fuel. What effect is that trend likely to have on women? One thing to consider is that when we think about macroeconomic policies, we often think of it as gender neutral, but these economic policy choices affect women and men differently. Women are disproportionately represented in the public sector in many countries and when there's a budget cut that affects these sectors, women are more likely to suffer from job losses and also reduce wages. But also, women are also predominantly consumers of these services like programs for single mothers, healthcare and social services, reproductive health services, as well as child benefits. So when budget cuts specifically affect these services, they tend to also increase the burden on women as they can have to increase their unpaid care labor to fill in the gaps that basically public sector has left. And yet we are seeing Bill Gates more and more evidence of what some people have called a she economy taking root driven for, by instance, greater workforce participation among women, jump in female entrepreneurship as well. Are we getting closer to a point where women are more insulated against shocks of the sort we've been talking about here? So when we look at women's labor force participation, for example, in the US, it has been increasing since the pandemic. So in January 2024 data, it stands at 57.5%, but when we compare that before the pandemic, for example, February 2020, it was 58%. And so in that sense, there is not a very big increase in women's labor force participation. It just recovered to the levels before the pandemic. But when we look at sort of the self-employment specifically, so it makes up about 10% of employment in the US. And that has been increasing. And what they found was that self-employment really increased among women, and especially non-white women that were coming from relatively less educated people. And they also found that women with young children specifically took up this self-employment precisely because it was hard to take care of children during the pandemic and try to work at the same time. But when we look at sort of what happens since the pandemic also that a lot of policies expired. For example, Biden administration announced a new rule to reduce child care costs that's going to basically limit family payments to 7% of their income. They're also increasing subsidies to the providers. But what is estimated is it's going to only affect costs for about 100,000 children. So we're talking about really the very low income Americans are going to benefit from this and it's not going to be a very generalized benefit. Okay, however, some policymakers are trying to keep the focus on gender equality. The UN for instance is calling for gender responsive financing, though that does sound like spending money in a time of austerity. The idea of gender responsive budgeting has been around for a really long time. But what it essentially means is that we want to ensure that both men and women benefit equally from different public sector programs. And if a program needs to be cut, that it that also need to be evaluated whether who is going to suffer from that reduction in spending. There are different options that governments can have. First of all, the debts that they accumulated during the pandemic can be rescheduled. But also, you know, they can think about raising more revenue and progressive taxation is one of the ways in which they can actually raise more funding in order to reduce the budget deficits. And in addition, there is a lot of concerns about women's reproductive rights. And that's not even a budget issue. That's a much really a political issue currently in the United States after the Supreme Court decision to overturned Roy V. Wade, where we see several states outright banned abortion. Women who are turned down when they want to denobortion, they can see the experience significant financial hardship going forward. Their credit scores deteriorated over time. There is other related research that show that also this has implications for education and labor market outcomes. And there's even suggestion that such increasing financial stress can lead to more intra-hustled conflict and violence towards women. So we need to consider basically a very broad set of policies when it comes to thinking about gender equality and what types of policies help improve gender pay gaps in the US. Bilga Erton is an associate professor of economics and international affairs at Northeastern University. Bilga, thank you so much for being with us on What's News. Thanks for having me. And that is What's News for Friday Morning. Today's episode was produced by Kate Bollivan and Charlie Duffield with additional support from Hattie Moir. We will be back tonight with a new show. Otherwise, have a great weekend and happy International Women's Day. The latest US jobs numbers show strong hiring, but also signs of cooling. And where are the nation's job hotspots? Turns out they're moving. More broadly, we are seeing a shift when we're talking to geographic patterns. We're also seeing more of a suburban shift too. Plus, a probe finds Colorado's star DNA analyst intentionally manipulated data. It's Friday, March 8th. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. Let's start with the jobs numbers on this jobs Friday. A US hiring boom continued in February, though there are signs of cooling. The Labor Department set employers added 275,000 jobs. Far surpassing the 198,000 economists had expected. Unemployment ticked up a notch to 3.9% and wage growth slowed. Reporter David Uberty has more details on today's report. The major sectors that led jobs growth were namely health care, government and food services, so restaurants and bars. Additionally, and this is sort of an interesting cross tab that we found deeper in the data, a lot of the gains in the US labor force over the last year have actually been driven by a growing immigrant workforce. So these are foreign-born workers, as opposed to American native-born workers. That's just an interesting footnote that has really helped fuel some of this labor market expansion. The Goldilocks report, that is not too hot, not too cold, just like in the fairy tale, also supports the Fed's rate cut outlook. Here's David again. The key takeaways are that the US economy remains pretty strong, and importantly, it is walking this very fine line between being too strong, which could help fuel a rebound in inflation, and also in the other hand, slowing down too fast, which could lead to a recession. All of this suggests that the economy is making progress to the proverbial soft landing. Investors across the country expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in the coming months, and nothing in this report really suggests that they will deviate from that at this point. On yesterday's show, we told you about an unfolding DNA scandal in Colorado that posed a threat to thousands of criminal cases. Today we have an update to that story. A preliminary investigation has found Colorado's star DNA scientist, Ivonne Missy Woods, intentionally manipulated evidence for years. The review did not find that Woods falsified DNA matches or fabricated DNA profiles, but the report said Woods omitted material facts and records, tampered with DNA testing results and violated lab policies. It said at least 652 cases she handled between 2008 and 2023 were affected. Woods's lawyer said she never created or falsely reported any ex-culpatory DNA evidence or gave false testimony resulting in wrongful convictions or imprisonment. He said she is cooperating with the ongoing investigation. And former President Donald Trump says he secured a nearly $92 million bond to cover a defamation judgment of more than $83 million that he owes to writer E. Jean Carroll. Trump is still facing severe financial burdens. He's also been ordered to pay $355 million in penalties, stemming from a civil fraud case in New York. The interest continues to grow daily and the total amount now stands at around $454 million. Coming up from the job market to the new job hotspots, where to find them after the break.

It's just that easy. The nation's hottest job spots are shifting to sun belt cities before the pandemic. The West was leading jobs growth and analysis by the economic innovation group found employment there was growing by 2.3%. The highest rate among the nation's regions, but that's changed, especially after a series of tech layoffs as a last spring the sun belt region from the Southwest to the southeast was leading the pack joining me now with more is our workplace reporter to ping Chen. Welcome back to ping. Thanks for having me. So what sun belt cities are most attractive and why? Yeah, so we've seen jobs growth really boom in a number of cities across the sun belt. Some of the places that are seeing the highest degree of growth or Phoenix. Huntsville, Alabama. We've seen Albuquerque really do well places like Las Vegas to a spectrum of cities, but what they've gotten common is more space often lower cost of labor and in many cases fewer building restrictions as well. You know, to ping Phoenix struck me because I went there a couple of months ago and I saw that enormous semiconductor factory that the Taiwanese company TSMC is building curious what industries are moving out to sun belt cities. Yeah, that's absolutely part of it with the Biden administration's emphasis on trying to push domestic manufacturing. We are seeing certain industries, whether it's semiconductor to battery production, a lot of those industries bulking up production in cities across the sun belt and Phoenix certainly you know would be among some of the beneficiaries. What we're seeing is really just with the rise of remote work that's enabled a lot of workers obviously to pick up and move and in other cases companies to expand their footprints in some of these other areas. If you look at the companies that have been relocating their headquarters in recent years tech really tops the list and we do see a number of tech companies moving self or moving farther east and trying to find a base where they can operate. So as with lower costs sometimes with a feeling of an easier business environment and also a number of companies saying that when they are looking to set up maybe a broader footprint elsewhere thinking to about sustainability and how to find a place where they can grow and continue to expand and have sort of the talent pool with the depth that they need to continue to recruit and to grow in the coming years. So that brings us in a way to the cities that are now losing out on new jobs. What are some of the cities that are experiencing people leaving now for jobs elsewhere and why? When we look at the cities that have been seeing a lump in jobs growth and specifically I'm looking now at a list of the top cities or metro areas that have seen declines and job postings. We're really looking at some of kind of the traditional superstar cities. If you look at San Francisco Bay Area it's seen about a 25% drop in the percentage of job posting since 2020 that's according to data from indeed other cities up there also include areas around Seattle San Jose and so we're seeing quite clearly here a lot of the influence of tech layoffs and that kind of downturn. Also just more broadly cities that have traditionally been home to a lot of knowledge workers that have more recently obviously been able to work elsewhere and often in cheaper areas and so it's sort of a combination of both workers in some instances leaving and in other cases their employers choosing to move to as we just talked about. What does all this mean for those big cities like San Francisco that once drove jobs growth? One thing that's really striking in the reporting and in what economists have to say about some of these statistics is just that when we think about the way that growth in the US especially in a lot of innovation sectors has taken place over the past decade in the states. It's been often a really lopsided kind of growth concentrated in some of those cities like San Francisco which obviously has benefits of course but also pretty substantive drawbacks not only for the cities themselves which have often struggled with issues of affordability quite clearly but for the rest of the country too right it's not necessarily the healthiest of things to have a handful of metros really commanding the lion's share of growth. And so there's a lot of hope embodied in some of these figures when you do see the shift in both job opportunities going south and also some of the flattening of the pay bans nationally I mean these all speak to an economy in the US that potentially looks a lot more distributed and potentially also can both help some of the areas that have traditionally really been dealing with some of the benefits. But also the challenges of growth and also help a lot of places in the United States that have more traditionally been left behind that's our workplace reporter to ping chin. Apple has reversed a ban on epic games that have prevented the video game maker from building its own app store in Europe. The two have been battling for years over Apple's control over third party software on its devices today's reversal signals Apple could be softening at stance as it faces new regulations in the European Union according to people familiar with the matter the US justice department is expected to file an antitrust lawsuit in the coming weeks accusing Apple of monopolistic practices related to its interactions with outside companies. And the US military says it will resume flights of the V-22 Osprey aircraft hundreds of Ospreys were grounded in December following a fatal crash off the coast of Japan that killed eight US service members. The $90 million aircraft is a workhorse for the US military but it's been involved in accidents that have killed dozens of US service members leading to concerns over its safety and design. The US Navy said today the grounding was lifted after a thorough safety review and maintenance and procedural changes. And finally this Sunday the film world is coming together for the Academy Awards. So what a moviegoers think about the Oscar nominations. Here's our entertainment reporter John Jrgensen. The other inheimer was the story of Hollywood last year. And behind those movies did something like more than 2 billion at the worldwide box office which was just bananas. Barbie was by far the biggest box office draw but people really kind of gravitate to Oppenheimer as quote unquote high quality film and Oscar worthy film. In our poll it ranked number one almost across the board in terms of its quality level what people thought was a high quality film. And it was the one that people seemed to say was the most enjoyable as well. Obviously Barbie we found not only at the box office but in our poll results was the most scene of all the films. And people really rally behind Margot Robbie too as an actress in our poll. But I think they all see it as kind of a pop film and they seem to be aligned with Oscar voters and thinking that Oppenheimer is the one that's kind of deserving of the Oscar gold. I only saw one of those block fosters it was Barbie and I loved it and I am definitely looking forward to Ryan Gosling performing I'm just Ken on Oscars night. And that's what's news for this week.

From the currency black markets of Buenos Aires to the Caribbean island where no one owns property, to the giant underground caves where the US government stored a national cheese supply. Cheese came. migrants in Texas are waking up this morning to a new day of anxiety after a whirlwind of court orders yesterday. Okay, this is all part of a legal battle over an immigration enforcement law that the state of Texas passed last year. So this is the state weighing in on immigration. The law empowers police in Texas to arrest people that they suspect are living in the United States illegally. And then allows local judges to order that migrants be deported to Mexico, regardless of what country they may be originally from. For several hours yesterday, the United States Supreme Court allowed this law to be enforced. And then a lower court hit the pause button again. Julian Aguilar from the Texas newsroom is here with us with the latest good morning. Julian, good morning. So would you just start by walking us through all the legal developments yesterday and the arguments from both sides? Sure. So the law known as SB4 was originally scheduled to take effect earlier this month. But the Biden administration and immigrant rights groups sued to block it. They argue that the measure is discriminatory and usurps the federal government's responsibility to enforce immigration law. Texas leaders, including Governor Greg Abbott, say the law is necessary because of President Biden's open border policies. They point to a record number of asylum seekers entering the US through Texas. The legal battle swiftly rose to the US Supreme Court. And yesterday, the high court allowed the law to take effect. The justices didn't take a position on the merit of the case, but instead deferred to an original decision by a three judge federal panel of the appeals court. And then late last night, a difference had of judges on the same appeals court voted two to one to keep that law blocked. And those judges will hear arguments today on whether it should be kept on hold as the case plays out. So at any moment, perhaps as soon as today, the appeals court could allow the law to be implemented. And if that happens, what do we know about how local police might enforce it? So local law enforcement officers say they will comply, but they have concerns about how the law will affect their day to day operations. Sheriff Oscar Carillo from Culverson County along the West Texas border says he supports the law, but he's also concerned about how much it could cost his rule border county and others like it. I think we're going to be very selective about the cases we pick up our jail is like capacity as we speak today. And to start incarcerating undocumented people and charging with Mr. Meade or crime is a discussion. I'll have to have with my county attorney. That's a common sentiment as officials have said they don't have a lot of guidance on how to implement the law. So so let's say for the sake of argument that the law does take effect. If that happens, talk about some of the legal issues that people living in Texas might face. Sure. So civil and immigrant rights organizations, they have a lot of concerns. Chief among them is that police will have blanket authority to question somebody about their immigration status because of the way they look. Alan Lee Zagata with the border network for human rights says he's concerned about the laws impact on people of color and mixed status families in Texas. We know that this law is going to increase racial profiling. We know that this law is going to strip people their constitutional rights. We know that this law is also going to lead to the mass realization of our communities. It's also been argued by opponents of the bill that a migrant with legitimate claims to asylum could have their case put in jeopardy because of this law as they could face state criminal charges. And what are officials in Mexico saying about all this? Yeah, there was a strong response from the Mexican government in the short time the law was an effect. The foreign ministry said in the statement Tuesday that it won't accept migrants that have been deported under the Texas law. It also said it will file a brief in opposition to SB4 that highlights the challenges the law presents to the relationship between the United States and Mexico. That's William Aguilar from the Texas Newsroom. William, thank you. Thank you. Six former Mississippi police officers who pleaded guilty to torturing two black men are being sentenced this week in federal court. This story, which lasts about four minutes, includes details of violence. The officers raided a home early last year. Officers shot one of the men inside, then planted drugs and a gun at the scene to cover it up. With us now is Mississippi public broadcasting's Michael McEwen, Michael, good morning. Good morning. So you were in the courtroom yesterday in Jackson for the sentencing hearing. Tell us what happened. Yeah, so two of the six former ranking county police officers began their sentencing yesterday. They were part of a group self-styled as the gun squad. And in January of 2023, they broke into a home where two black men lived, brutalized them for more than two hours, tortured them, sexually assaulted them, and then try to cover it up. Hunter L. Word, who was a deputy at the time of the raid, was sentenced to 20 years yesterday. He faced the most high-munder sentencing guidelines, mostly because he shot Michael Corey Jenkins in the mouth and a mock execution that went awry. He was visibly shaking and crying in court and apologized directly to both of his victims. Lieutenant Jeffrey Middleton's hearing went much differently. His attorney really pushed the judge to sentence him differently from L Word. He argued his client played less of a role in the raid itself and that he didn't shoot a gun. But Judge Tom Lee gave Middleton 17 and a half years, which was the highest allowed under his guidelines. Because he said as a lieutenant, Middleton could have stopped the raid, but instead participated. I understand that new details in the case came out during this hearing. Yeah, most interestingly, the power structure of the so-called Goon Squad really came to light. Federal prosecutors said it was Lieutenant Middleton who actually devised the plan to cover up the raid and the accidental shooting. He told his fellow officers that if they told anyone what happened, he'd have them killed. And he also planted a gun and met on the scene to justify it. There is also testimony, the pointy to current Ranky County Sheriff Brian Bailey. And it alleged that he knew about the Goon Squad and tolerated it for years. It's also worth noting here that Eddie Parker and Michael Corey Jenkins are black men. And not only were they brutalized, tortured, and sexually assaulted. But we're also called several racial slurs. And we're told by the all white officers that go quote, back to their side of the river in Jackson. And Ranky County most notably is a white suburban enclave just east of Jackson. I understand that the two victims were in court for all this. How did they how did they react to all this? So Eddie Parker says he still really struggles as a result of that night. He was sexually assaulted and he had his life threatened if he reported the attack to any authorities. And he says that he's still afraid to fall asleep or even go into public. But he did stand up in the courtroom and say that he forgave Hunter Elwood. Here he is speaking again after the hearing. What is done? I forgive that Parker. He's still he's still dead. You know what I'm saying? What he did and he has to be punished for it. Michael Corey Jenkins, who shot in the mouth and nearly killed, told me that he felt justice was beginning to be served, but that he didn't forgive Elwood because he wasn't sorry, but it's only sorry that he got caught. And before we let you go, what's next? So the other four officers, including the sheriff departments lead investigator will be sentenced to per day through tomorrow. And just from what I heard in court yesterday, I expect more details about how the Goon Squad operated to come out. That is Michael McEwan with Mississippi Public Broadcasting. Michael, thank you. Thank you. Democrats have faced a narrow path to holding their Senate majority this November. And it runs through Ohio. A state Donald Trump has won twice. A Senator Sherrod Brown is one of the few Democrats who have held Senate seats in red states. And now he knows his opponent for this fall in a primary Republicans endorsed Donald Trump's chosen candidate Cleveland businessman Bernie Merino. Karen Casler is statehouse news bureau chief for Ohio's public radio and TV stations. And she's with us now. Good morning. Hi, good morning. You know, from here at least this Senate primary race had seemed close in the polls. What gave Merino the edge? Simply put, it was Donald Trump. His airport rally on Saturday and date in for Merino was a big factor. A political action committee aligned with US Senate Democrats had bought $2.7 million in ads in the final week saying Merino is too conservative for Ohio. His rivals accused Democrats of meddling in the primary because they viewed Merino as the weakest candidate in the field. But those ads may actually have helped Merino who says he wears the Trump endorsement as a badge of honor. I wonder whether Sherrod Brown is going to wear with honor. His 99% voting record with Joe Biden. Whether Joe Biden is the kind of person that he likes to associate with because I would predict this. If Joe Biden enters Ohio, Sherrod Brown is going to fly out of here like a scared cat. Now, Brown has talked about positions where he has split from Biden, such as on immigration. But Brown comes into the race as a popular candidate who won Ohio after Trump did. And Brown has more money than all three of the Republicans who were running for the nomination had in total. So, could you just say more about how Trump's support influenced this race? Well, Merino was the Trump endorsed candidate. State Senator Matt Dolan had made it clear that he supported Trump's policies. He was not endorsed by Trump. He was the Ohio GOP establishment candidate backed by Governor Mike DeWine and former Senator Rob Portman. They had not been enthusiastic about Trump but had endorsed Trump in 2020. The third candidate in this race, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, had also worked really hard to get Trump's endorsement, but had fallen way behind in money to Merino and Dolan who were both wealthy. So now that the GOP candidate has been decided, well, the Democratic candidate too, but what can we expect next? We can expect the most expensive U.S. Senate race in Ohio history. Democrats started attacking Merino almost immediately after the race was called by about 835 last night. The Democratic Senateorial Campaign Committee put out a digital ad that featured criticisms of Merino by Dolan and LaRose, his opponents. The Ohio Democratic Party has been pushing a narrative that whoever emerged from this brutal campaign would do so with a lot of baggage. And they've attempted to draw attention to Merino's positions on immigration and on abortion. Meanwhile, Brown has a liberal voting record in the Senate, but has appealed to blue collar voters. He has strong support from unions. Democrats seem as a candidate who can appeal to moderate Ohioans in those frustrated with Trump, but Republican say Merino is uniting their base and the Ohio is firmly behind the form of President.

We all hear things differently, and that can be tough when there's so much noise. This election year, we're a space to speak up and to listen. On Bullseye, Peter Dinklage, Bird Whisperer. I started talking to the crows and befriending crows. I fed them every morning there at my door.\",\" 4 years later, what's still on their minds? Georgia, President Joe Biden, and former President Donald Trump campaigned there today. And also on Biden's mind? Motivating voters who turned swing states blue in 2020. I'm Scott Simon. The Holy Month of Ramadan begins soon, but likely without another ceasefire in Gaza, or Palestinians there face starvation. The US military is planning to get more aid into the strip by sea with a temporary port and a floating pier. But what is being done right now to help? And an Nigeria official say more than 250 children have been abducted. Gunmen attacked while they were in school. We'll learn more about Nigeria's second mass kidnapping in a week.

President Biden has taken his message from the state of the union out on the road. He's got a busy travel schedule over the next week, kidding key states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia. He started off his tour yesterday in another battleground state, Pennsylvania. And here at White House correspondent Deepa Shiverham was along for the ride and joins us now. Deepa, thanks for being with us. Hey, thanks for having me. And what are the president focus on at his speech in Philadelphia? Yeah, I mean, there were a lot of similarities from the speech that Biden gave in Philly and his state of the union address. He really followed the same themes, particularly on what he called kitchen table issues, which is namely lowering costs for Americans. One thing was different though. On Thursday night, we heard Biden refer to former president Trump as his predecessor multiple times. He didn't actually name him, but he talked a lot about the differences between him and Trump. Last night, though, the gloves came off. Biden called out Trump by name several times. He blamed him for restrictions on reproductive rights. And he blamed him for some of the ways he says America has changed. We ride down the street and there was a Trump banner with the FU on it and a little and a six year old kid putting up his middle finger. Did you ever sit? No, I'm serious. Did you ever think it here? People talked the way they do. Look at the means, the means who we are. That's not who America, that's not America. A couple things he didn't mention on the road version of this speech was the Warren Gaza. And I will note there were a lot of protesters outside the middle school where he gave that speech. He also didn't talk about immigration either. He's taking some heat from progressives lately and advocates for immigrants because on Thursday night, he referred to an undocumented immigrant arrested for a crime as an illegal. We asked him yesterday if he regretted using that term. He kind of sidestepted and said, you know, quote, technically, he's not supposed to be here. Day you're traveling with President to Georgia, obviously, another swing state. Its primary is Tuesday. What do you know about the rally in Atlanta tonight? It's focusing on three key groups representing communities of color who are going to be formally endorsing Biden today. That's the Latino and AAPI victory funds, which are organizations that bring out voters in their communities and collective pack, which organizes black voters. And these collisions are really critical for Biden in the state of Georgia. He won it by a very narrow margin in 2020. But it's not just Georgia where this matters. Overall, we know that this election is going to be decided by small, small numbers. And in these key swing states like Nevada and North Carolina, Michigan, voter turnout from communities of color could very well decide the course of this presidential race. And keep in mind, this is all kind of coming at a time when enthusiasm for Biden among black and Latino voters, especially, has been lower. So he needs to drum up more support. And it's not so much here that these voters are turning to Trump, right? It's that they just could not show up and vote at all in November. And that would be detrimental for Biden. Georgia courses, the home state of Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Green. She had what I'll call a cameo the other night at the president state of the union address. She did. Yeah, Biden often uses her as a bit of a foil to talk about right wing supporters of Trump. And on Thursday, she was wearing that red maga hat and heckling him during the state of the union. So Biden started off his remarks yesterday in Philly talking about her and the crowd there got really fired up about it. So I wouldn't be surprised if she becomes a bit of a regular. Punch line, if you will, on the road as Biden keeps traveling. And, you know, speaking of that, he's got a lot of travel plans this week. New Hampshire on Monday, then Milwaukee and Saginaw, Michigan in the middle of the week. And there are $30 million in ads going up over the next six weeks for this campaign. So it's really kicking into high gear for Biden. And here's Deepah Shiverham. Thanks so much. Thank you. Talks to secure another ceasefire in Gaza before the start of Ramadan seem to have stalled. And there are fears that conditions there will continue to worsen. More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Hamas and Israel, according to Gaza's health ministry. Fatma, thanks for being with us. Thanks for having me, Scott. Please tell us what it looks like in Jerusalem there at the moment. Well, Scott, for Palestinians here, there's a lot of anticipation over what the coming month is going to look like. You know, there are concerns for Gaza if Israel decides to invade Drafa in the south, where most people in Gaza are huddled. There's an overall feeling of hopelessness for the war. But you know, they also have their own concerns here since the war began. Israel has imposed a lot of restrictions on Palestinian movement. They spend hours at checkpoints every day. And especially when it comes to accessing Al-Aqsa compound, which is one of the holiest sites for both Muslims and Jews, at the moment, Palestinians from the West Bank and men under the age of 40 are not allowed to go in without a special permit. And very few people can actually get those. They're generally afraid and uneasy. Now Israel says that it will allow access to everyone, as it usually does, at least during the first week of the Holy Month. And there's been some politics around that. Israel's far right minister of national security, Eta Mara Ben-Govir had advocated for a near-blanket ban on Palestinian worshipers. He was overruled. It seems that senior officials in Israel do not want to provoke further tensions during time of war. And Al-Aqsa has often been a flashpoint. Hasn't it not just in Israel on the Palestinian territory, but across the region? That's right. So Al-Aqsa compound, you know, includes the mosque, the iconic dome of the rock. There's museums and other institutions there. Now with the Israeli government shift to the far right in recent years, there's been a slow shrinking of Palestinian spaces. I was actually there yesterday and saw something unusual. There was heavy presence of police. And they were standing close to the worshipping sites. They normally stand a bit further back. So there's a real fear among Palestinians that they won't be allowed to worship and during Ramadan, that becomes a more sensitive issue. Now when you add that to the backdrop of the war in Gaza, any tensions could easily further inflame an already tense region, including in Iraq where Iranian-backed militias have been attacking US troops and in the Red Sea, where Houthi rebels in Yemen have been firing missiles at international shipping and killed sailors this week. Let's now turn to Gaza. The United Nations says nearly two million people faced our vision there. President Biden said in the State of the Union speech that the US military will provide a floating harbor to ship aid in. What's been local reaction to that? Well, it's seen as a sign of growing frustration with Israel, not just in Washington, but among eight groups as well, that Israel is not prioritizing humanitarian aid and that Israeli officials don't understand the responsibility to help civilians. Now Israel says it's not putting any limits on aid. Meanwhile, there's been mixed reaction to President Biden's announcement. You know, the harbor won't be ready for weeks. Longer term, it could make a difference. I spoke to Jamie McGoldrich. He's the UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories here he is. Any supplementary possibility of bringing in aid through either air drops or by sea as helpful, but the main part of it has to be done by road. That's the only way we can deliver bulk and at scale to populations inside Gaza, especially in the North. So Scott, it won't help with the immediate crisis. Now the UN says that children are starving to death as we speak and it will get much, much worse if aid doesn't start flooding in immediately. And for that McGoldrich says that Israel needs to open more border crossings and also allow aid groups access to secure roads in Gaza. And bears fought Mattanis in Jerusalem. Thanks so much. Thank you. A Jiren officials say that more than 200 and 80 students have been kidnapped in the northwest of the country. They are between the ages of 8 and 15. One witness told the BBC that the children were taken from school Thursday morning by dozens of gunmen or motorbikes. This mask kidnapping echoes another abduction a decade ago when Boko Haram militants abducted hundreds of schoolgirls from the town of Chibok. We're joined now by Alexis Aquijirim, the managing editor for Africa at the news website Semaphore. He spent years reporting from Nigeria. Thanks so much for being with us. Thank you. What more can you tell us about this mass abduction? First of all, nobody's kind responsibility for this mass abduction. Although some people in various quarters are blaming Ansaru, which is a breakaway faction of the Boko Haram militant group, what we do know is that students were taken along with a teacher. Parents say that local vigilantes tried to repel the gunmen but have been overpowered. In these situations in the northwest where there are lots of these criminal gangs coming out, kidnapped for ransom, you do often see vigilante groups springing up because these things are happening in vast, ungoverned spaces and so the police can't necessarily intervene. But in this case, the vigilante group were unable to repel the gunmen. And this is effectively the largest mass abduction that we've seen in Nigeria for about three years. I mean, the last one on this scale was in the summer of 2021 and around 150 children were taken then. How is the Nigerian government responding to this abduction? Well, President Bolotinibu said he was confident that the victims will be rescued and he's directed the security forces to find the students as well as that. There's a system of state governors as well that could do in a state governor where this happened has also visited the town and he's promised to get the students released. So the security forces have these directions, but I mean, it's going to be tough for them to respond. To be honest, this is the typical response from the Nigerian government in this situation. We say the confident and they always say that they're going to do the best to rescue the children. And yet we, I guess, have to remind ourselves many of the girls who were taken in the Boko Haram kidnap, you're still missing. How common are mass abductions like these? So mass abductions have become less common, but there was a definitely a spade of them in northern Nigeria around four years ago. And there were these copycat attacks and schools were being hit with hundreds of children being taken. But you absolutely right, the abduction of the Chibok girls, which is almost to the day a decade ago, we're sparked this. And as a result of that, clearly criminal gangs saw that there was an opportunity to make money for kidnapped for ransom. Now, even though mass abductions that are becoming less common, kidnapped for ransom has become a lucrative industry for criminal gangs in Nigeria. And it's become a problem at a lower level whereby these gangs who are mostly concentrated in the north west of the country will kidnap ordinary people and shake down the families for money. And if it's a high profile series of attacks, then maybe the state government might get involved as well. As I mentioned before, these are vast ways of land that are effectively ungoverned spaces. And so these criminal gangs set themselves up in forests when they rove around different parts of the region on motorcycles and they're heavily armed and it's very, very, very hard to stop them. Mr. Aquajirum, what's it like to live in Nigeria? It's the most popular nation in Africa and yet in your description, large parts of it are essentially lawless. I think it's very difficult for Nigerians at the moment. It's a massive country. It's got more than 200 million inhabitants and security forces are overstretched. So at the moment, they're tackling different challenges simultaneously. So in the north west, you get these bandits who kidnap ordinary people in the northeast. You've got a long-running Islamist insurgency that's lasted for about 15 years and then in various other parts of the country, there are issues in the southeast. There's an insurgency in terms of separatist movements and it's just hard. Wherever you are, there is likely to be some kind of issue and it's hard for the security forces to keep on top of all of it. Alexis Aquajirum from the news site, Semaphorth.

Plus, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson says, \\\"Enough's enough to dissident Republicans.\\\" And plans to rely on Democrats to avoid a government shutdown. And state capitalism. What is it and why do American presidents love it so much? The government doesn't actually go out and buy companies or order them around, but it sort of intervenes regularly and says, \\\"Hey businesses, this is what we think is the national interest. This is what you should be doing.\\\" It's Thursday, March 21st. And here's the A.M. Edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories, moving your world today. Meta Platforms, Microsoft, X, Spotify, and Match Group have filed legal petitions protesting Apple's app store policies. The five companies are objecting to how the tech giant has complied with the federal court ruling that ordered Apple to allow alternative payment methods. Apple charges up to a 30% commission for purchases in the app store for services or one-time fees. A rate that developers say is too high, but which Apple has defended saying it invests in privacy and security measures that protect users. Sam Shechner is the Journal's European tech reporter. These rivals are going to continue trying to fight to force the maker of iPhones to loosen its controls over third party software on its platform. And they're fighting this in the US in court. The EU recently fined Apple in a case involving Spotify and there's a new law in Europe, the Digital Markets Act that has led to disputes as well. The services business through the app store is one of Apple's biggest businesses, and so the question really is how much control will they continue to have over that and what kinds of commissions will they be able to get in the future? And will what consumers pay to use third party apps, will that money go entirely to those app developers? Will it go in part to Apple and how will they divide up that pie? That's billions of dollars at stake. Apple is also facing an investigation by the Justice Department, which could soon file an antitrust complaint about its business practices. Meanwhile, Reddit has priced its IPO at the top of its target range, given the company evaluation of roughly $6.4 billion. The social media forum is set to go public later today under the ticker RDDT price in its shares at $34 a piece. Our Social Media Reporter Sarah Needleman, says the valuation is on the higher end and that future revenues could prove even more lucrative for Reddit. The company makes money mostly from advertising, and what's interesting is they built their own in ad network in the past, a couple of years from the ground up, so they're not relying on third parties to automate ads. Advertising is the vast majority of the revenue, but there is a new twist, that is AI. So what Reddit has been doing recently is it started selling access to its data, its API. And the biggest customers, who'd they hope to be the biggest customers licensing IT or AI companies. So that's a whole new line of revenue coming in for Reddit. It's still small, it's still early days, but that could be a big change for the company. And you can hear much more about Reddit's IPO on today's Tech News Briefing podcast wherever you get your podcasts. And the Bank of England will today round out a banner week for central banks after news from the BOJ, ECB and Fed this week. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled three rate cuts are still on the cards for this year, despite stickier than expected inflation. That means investors now think the Fed will cut rates by June, a move expected to be echoed by the European Central Bank as well. Paul Hannon is an economics editor for Dow Jones Newswires and says Central banks are finally starting to see inflation stabilize. The Swiss National Bank has surprisingly cut its key interest rate, and in doing that it's become the first central bank from a rich advanced economy to lower borrowing costs since this surge in inflation started way back in 2021. So this is definitely a sign that across rich countries as a whole, interest rates are likely to fall. The Bank of England has been a little bit vague about exactly when it will lower its key rates, and most investors expect that to happen in August. But as the Swiss Central Bank has just demonstrated, investor expectations can turn out to be wrong, and it may be possible that the Bank of England will come in earlier, possibly alongside the Fed and the ECB in June. Israeli security officials are crafting a plan to distribute aid in Gaza. That is according to both Israeli and Arab officials. It's being led by a top Israeli general who has been traveling to regional capitals to garner support for the effort. Journal Middle East Editor Michael Amon says the proposal would have anti-Hamas Palestinians run aid distribution networks throughout Gaza. So the aid would come in from multiple places. There is humanitarian aid being brought in by the UN and the WFP, that has slowed down to a trickle, but Israel and the US and Arab governments are working to get that boosted. So that would be one source of aid. Israel has opened up a new land crossing in the north and is escorting aid in with troops. And that would also be a big source of aid that would go to this network of distributors. And then there's also a sea corridor in which aid is inspected by Israelis in Cyprus and then shipped to a port being built in Gaza. He says it could be weeks or months before it could be implemented. This is part of the evacuation plan actually that Israel has begun creating for getting civilians out of the city of Rafah, which is a border town in southern Gaza. That is the last stronghold of Hamas. Israel is planning and offensive on Rafah, but has held back as ceasefire talks are ongoing in Qatar with Hamas, the US, and other Arab governments. If all goes well in an ideal world, civilians would be moved out of Rafah into displacement camps, many of them along the beach, running north, north to south. And this aid distribution network would in large part be aimed at feeding the people in those camps, which could be 750,000 to a million people. On Capitol Hill, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has indicated he will move forward with legislation to avoid a partial government shutdown this weekend, defying members of his own caucus who want to slow the process down. Both Chambers of Congress need to pass the remaining six funding bills before tomorrow's deadline. Many of Johnson's fellow Republicans objected to the short turnaround, arguing that Johnson must follow house rules and make the text available 72 hours before a vote. But with a tight deadline, Johnson will bring the bill forward and will need to rely on Democratic votes to pass it. We have to govern and we have to demonstrate that we can keep the train on the tracks and we are. Johnson is using a procedure that does not require the 72-hour window, but that path means the spending bills will need a two thirds majority to pass. Donald Trump's social media platform could be listed on the stock market as early as next week. That would lead to a major windfall for the former president as much as $3.5 billion dollars. Truth Social's parent company is set to go public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company. If shareholders approve the merger Friday, Trump's company could replace the SPAC on the market as early as Monday. Truth Social has failed to catch on with users and has performed poorly financially. It burned through tens of millions of dollars in cash, but the valuation of the SPAC that it hopes to merge with has soared to $6 billion. Trump owns 60% of the shares. He would have to hold the shares until September before he could sell them, but regulatory filings show he could request a waiver to sell them early or borrow against their value. The Truth Social valuation comes as Trump faces a cash crunch and remains unable to secure a bond to guarantee payment of a $454 million fraud judgment against him. The deadline to do so is also Monday. Coming up, subsidies, tax breaks, the bully pulpit using the powers of the federal government to influence business. Our economics commentator says presidents of both parties embrace state capitalism. We've got that story and more after the break. If TikTok gets sold, the decision to do so will not be made in its boardroom. The real deciders will be in Washington. The same goes for U.S. Steel, Washington will ultimately decide whether the iconic Pennsylvania company gets bought by a Japanese firm or one based in Ohio. That is because the United States is slouching towards state capitalism. So writes our Chief Economics Commentator Greg Ip. Greg, lay it out. How do you define state capitalism? Well, most people have heard of socialism, which is where the government largely controls or owns the means of production. State capitalism is a more lukewarm version of government intervention. The government doesn't actually go out and buy companies or order them around, but it sort of intervenes regularly and says, \\\"Hey businesses, this is what we think is the national interest. This is what you should be doing, and we're going to pass laws. We're going to change taxes. We're going to use the bully pulpit to make sure you do that.\\\" And it goes all the way from extreme versions like you have in China where Beijing literally does control many companies and order other companies around to what I would call the version that the US is slouching towards, where increasingly Congress and the President and various political figures see it as their duty and their privilege and their right to basically tell companies what to do because it fits with whatever their definition of the national interest is. And you write that it isn't just one party that believes in this system. Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump have embraced state capitalism. Perhaps without saying as much, give us some examples. Well, right, I mean, first of all, the United States has never been a pure, let's say, fair paradise. I mean you only have to look at the military industrial complex to see that government and business have always been intertwined to some extent. But at least it's a matter of principle, US leaders on both sides more or less subscribed to the idea that free market capitalism was the most superior system and that private business should be allowed to decide how to allocate capital to what was best for their shareholders. But I don't think either Trump or Biden believe that. I'm not sure if either of them ever have. I mean Trump in his first term in office made that clear telling companies not to move production to other countries using trade law, tariffs and so forth to punish foreign companies and aid American companies. And taking extremely personal opinions and approaches to decisions about, for example, what mergers were allowed to happen, even whether TikTok should be bought or sold. Joe Biden's version of state capitalism is perhaps a little less personal. He sort of embraces industrial policy. We should be handing out subsidies and tax breaks to favored companies for things like green energy. But when last week he said Nippon Steel should not be allowed to buy U.S. Steel, he went beyond that to a very political interpretation of state capitalism. Effectively, he doesn't want a takeover to occur that hurts his political base, which is unionized workers. What's the risk here, is it the message that business can't be certain of what's to come in the United States? I think there's a couple of risks. The first is that from a matter of basic economics is that when businesses are motivated by something other than what's the highest reach around their money, they make poor investments. Another is that honestly, it's very difficult to actually do state capitalism smartly. You end up passing one rule like a tariff and then passing another rule like a subsidy to make up for the damage of the first rule. The final risk is that essentially people in power end up being incapable of distinguishing between the national interest in their own personal interest. Trump was for TikTok being sold. Now, apparently he's against it. And same with Biden. I mean whether or not he wins Pennsylvania that seems to be driving this latest decision. And businesses themselves naturally respond to these signals. So Cleveland-Cliffs a competitor to Nippon Steel, is working the political system for its purposes to try and defeat Nippon Steel's bid. And if you look at the various machinations for what happens to TikTok, we see Steve Mnuchin, a former treasury secretary for Donald Trump, is now making his own play for it, which clearly one can see probably has some connection to the politicization of the ultimate outcome of that decision. Is there any concrete evidence that this state capitalism in the United States is actually deterring businesses from operating there? It's probably a little bit too soon, but you can certainly see in our conversations that they are sort of taking into account the possibility of political interference in the way they behave, the investments that they make and so forth. This is a sort of thing that we'll see its effects felt more subtly and slowly over time. But presumably these companies are going to make decisions more for the medium term instead of the long term because they have to think about the next political election. Well, certainly they're going to try and do their best for the medium term or the long term. For example, whether Intel is going to invest a lot of money in semiconductor facilities in the United States is both a function of the subsidies that it hopes to get to do that made in America construction, but also has to fit with its five to 10 year plan. But the huge risk, of course, is that any business that bets on any continuity in the direction of state capitalism is at risk of a new president coming in, deciding to go in a completely different direction. So one aspect of Biden's state capitalism is he wants electric vehicle batteries to be made in America, but he doesn't want them made by Chinese companies. So if you're Ford, you have to decide, well, do we want to do business with the Chinese battery company or do we not? If you're General Motors, you have to make the same decision and you have to weigh the possibility that a few years from now, Donald Trump will be the president and he'll decide to just ditch the entire program altogether.

And federal regulators say large grocery chains use their size and scale to edge out smaller rivals during the pandemic. This report really falls in line with a lot of what we already know as consumers. Grocery prices have been high and stayed high. Plus Reddit stock jumps in its market debut. It's Thursday, March 21st. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that move the world today. The US Justice Department, 15 states and the District of Columbia have sued Apple, alleging the tech giant exploits an illegal monopoly. The suit claims Apple prevented software developers and mobile gaming companies from offering better options on the iPhone, leveraging its dominance to block software and limit the functionality of competing devices, resulting in higher prices for consumers. Apple says it plans to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. With today's filing, US officials have now sued all four of the tech giants they've been focused on. Apple has also faced a lot of regulatory scrutiny over the app store. This is very distinct from that. It's actually about how Apple interacts with outside parties that want access to its users. Also, the other cases that the different regulators have brought against the other tech companies are all based on different aspects of what those companies do. In the Google case, one of the big sticking points is how Google deals with ad software. Another aspect of the case is a deal that it has with Apple to be the default search provider on the Safari browser. In the case with Meta platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, the Federal Trade Commission has scrutinized Meta's acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram and said that there were anti-competitive aspects of that. With Amazon, it has to do with the third-party marketplace and how Amazon interacts with its sellers. With all these four giant technology companies, it's an effort by the Biden administration to really reign in the power of big tech. Shares of Reddit soared more than 48% in its stock market debut, which we previewed this morning. It's a vote of confidence in the social media company whose users fueled the meme stock craze, and it gives the company a valuation of around $9.5 billion. In the broader market, all three major US indexes finished higher, notching new record closes. Investors are optimistic a surge in borrowing costs is coming to an end soon. The Dow led the way, inching closer to the 40,000 mark. The CEOs of major airlines are requesting a meeting with Boeing's directors. As we've been reporting, frustrations with the plane maker have been growing after the January blowout on a 737 Max and production problems that have roiled the industry. We report exclusively that major carriers want to express their concerns to Boeing. Andrew, what do the CEOs hope to accomplish at this meeting? The CEOs want a plan. They've been frustrated not only by the Alaska Airlines incident, but also the fallout: mounting delays, production issues, scrutiny by various government agencies. Alaska Airlines itself was the butt of a joke on Saturday Night Live, raising questions in the minds of passengers about the safety of the aircraft that the airlines fly. And so the airline CEOs want some assurances that the board of directors at Boeing has a plan for the recovery of the company because they, like the rest of the United States, need Boeing to succeed. How is Boeing responding to this request so far, and what are the next steps? Boeing has responded to the initial request to meet with the board of directors with an offer to send board members to meet the airline CEOs. The board members may include Chairman Larry Kellner, who used to run Continental Airlines, which has since become part of United, so he can understand what it's like to run a carrier and can speak the same language. Those meetings will apparently take place in the coming weeks, and it'll be interesting to see what the outcome is. Coming up, federal regulators say large grocery chains edged out smaller rivals during the pandemic. More on a new report out today after the break. Do you remember empty store shelves at your local grocery store during the height of the pandemic or jockeying to schedule a delivery of food and household goods? In a new report out today, the Federal Trade Commission faults big grocers for pandemic tactics, accusing them of using their size and scale to get an edge over smaller competitors, as stores struggled with shortages and distribution bottlenecks. FTC Chair Lina Khan said, \\\"Dominant firms used this moment to come out ahead, at the expense of their competitors and the communities they serve.\\\" Welcome, Liz. Thanks so much, Annmarie. Thanks for having me. Liz, what exactly does the FTC allege these large grocers did? Weren't all chains, to some extent, struggling with supply chain issues during the pandemic? That's definitely right, Annmarie. Chains of all sizes had these problems. They couldn't get toilet paper. Later on, they couldn't get other materials. The FTC in this report specifically looked at the effect that large grocery retailers had on the broader market and found that they were able to do things like put stricter delivery requirements into place for their suppliers, so requiring them to meet a certain higher percentage of on time or in full shipments, which were things that if the vendors didn't comply, they could get hit with a fine. Of course, to avoid the fine, many vendors then went in and delivered goods to those larger retailers before some of their smaller rivals. These tactics, the FTC says, were a way for larger retailers to use that size, use that role in supply chains to keep their shelves stocked even as their smaller competitors had a much harder time. To be clear, the FTC is not blaming these larger grocers for all the bottlenecks that we saw during the pandemic, just that they were able to sort of edge their power with their scale and size. That's exactly right. The FTC was talking about how broadly there were all of these supply chain disruptions. Larger retailers were just able to use their size and their scale to secure supply for their shelves to keep their shelves stocked, even as smaller retailers were facing greater difficulties doing so. Are there any consequences as a result of this report? What are the companies going to be on the hook for potentially? The FTC report does not actually allege any wrongdoing. The next step will, I'm sure, certainly be for lawmakers to take a look at this, for committees to take a look at this. The FTC also looked at grocery pricing and found that revenue growth at large retailers had outpaced the cost increases that they faced. That was something that the FTC said warranted further inquiry by both the FTC and policymakers. Liz, I wonder how this report's being received generally, as we see consumers still facing higher food costs as one of those sticky areas of inflation that seems to persist as other prices are starting to come down. Absolutely. This report really falls in line with a lot of what we already know as consumers. Grocery prices have been high and stayed high. I think it also comes at a time when President Biden in his State of the Union speech was criticizing this practice of shrinkflation. You think of a bag of chips: it's the same price, but there's less chips in the bag. And we've also seen the FTC try to crack down on what they've called anti-competitive behavior that could be putting pressure on pricing upward, blocking the bid by Kroger to buy its rival Albertsons, for example. Speaking of grocery stores, coming up this weekend, we're answering your questions about food price inflation, from what causes it to how consumers and companies are coping. That's on What's News Sunday, available right here in the What's News feed.

Us home sales rose in February from the month before, marking the first time in more than two years that sales increased two months in a row. Existing home sales surged 9.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.38 million. The data from the National Association of Realtors defied expectations. Last year, home cells fell to their lowest levels in nearly 30 years. We report exclusively that certain Medicare members could get help paying for the weight loss drug Wegovy. That's as long as they have a history of heart disease and are using it to prevent recurring heart attacks and strokes. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services say Medicare Part D drug benefit plans, which are administered by private insurers, may cover anti-obesity medications if they receive approval for an additional use that's considered medically accepted under federal law. The new guidance cracks open Medicare reimbursement of the popular drugs, possibly paving the way for thousands of new people to get prescriptions. It could also add to pressure on commercial health plans to cover them. Finally, earlier this year, two scientists flagged dozens of research papers containing copied or doctored images. Some of them were connected to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. As a result, papers were retracted or corrected, sending shockwaves through the scientific community. Those errors were flagged with the help of a software tool that can find problematic visuals much more quickly than people using just their eyes. For example, common types of images examined include photographs of tissue slices and cells. Researchers say no two tissue samples taken from different animals should ever look the same under a microscope. When they do, that's a red flag. Science reporter Nidhi Subbaraman says one of the next challenges is identifying material created by artificial intelligence. People are already worried that generative AI or just sophisticated algorithms are ginning up whole chunks of text and being stuck into papers, and they're worried that images could be fabricated in that way from whole cloth. What looks like a closeup image of brain tissue might have been just cooked up by a computer. And how would you know? And that's the thing that these software tools are trying to figure out how to get a grip on. Are there any telltale signs that this wasn't created in the lab but was actually just wholly manufactured? The technology still isn't perfect. A research integrity director at Springer Nature, which publishes about 3000 journals including Nature, says the company still evaluates every red flag individually. A final note: an earlier version of this episode incorrectly said 17 states were involved in the DOJ suit against Apple. In fact, 15 states and the District of Columbia joined the suit. That's what's news for this Thursday afternoon. Today's show was produced by Pierre Bienaim\\u00e9 with supervising producer Michael Kosmides. We'll be back with a new show tomorrow morning.\",\" A House vote today takes aim at TikTok in its Chinese parent company. It's not a ban, it's a forced separation. Could a fierce last-minute lobbying campaign change the bill's bipartisan support? Unfounded conspiracy theories about non-citizens voting are back this election year, and they're taking even deeper hold with many Republicans. It's not only creating the hysteria, but this idea that only certain people should be allowed to participate in the process. And with Israel blocking most age shipments to Gaza by land, aid groups are turning to the sea to feed starving people. CPM, I always keep protected, and that support and water is a universal right.

We'll keep you up to speed on the stories that matter, and introduce you to people living the news. Not just commenting on it. It's here and now any time. The house today overwhelmingly passed a bill that would force TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company or face a ban in the US. Bipartisan supporters of the bill say Congress needs to step in because TikTok is a threat to national security. TikTok pushes back against this argument, saying that banning the social media platform amounts to a flagrant violation of free speech. The legislation will now head to the Senate. Hi, Deerter. Good morning. Good morning. So why do lawmakers want this bill now? The lawmakers from both parties who support the bill argue users' data privacy is not protected. It's collected and shared with Chinese officials. They say they influence the content that's pushed out to US users. They say the app is targeted journalist and interfered in elections. The FBI director Christopher Ray testified this week about his security concerns. Intel officials held classified briefings for House members on their assessments. We haven't seen all the details of those assessments. But these lawmakers say the app that's used by over 170 million Americans shouldn't be controlled by a foreign government, they say it's hostile to US interests. So this bill requires the company by chance to divest within six months or be banned on all US app platforms. My galger who chairs the House Select Committee on China, he's the lead Republican sponsor, he pushed back on the idea that this would amount to a total ban. What we're after is it's not a ban, it's a forced separation and the TikTok user experience can continue and improve so long as bite dance doesn't own the company. I talked to Roger Krishnamorthy, he's the top Democrat who helped write the bill. And he says that while TikTok downplays the impact of its owners, he says the top editor of bite dance is a secretary in the Chinese Communist Party. So what has the opposition to the bill been like? It's been a pretty intense lobbying campaign and the last week lawmakers say their offices have been flooded with calls from users who are worried about the future of the app. TikTok launched a push notice to its adult users, it linked their location data on their phone to identify their lawmaker, it connected them by phone to the offices. Galger told me there were younger callers that were crying when they called into office and unfortunately one actually threatened suicide if there's a ban. Opponents are raising big concerns that this is being rushed through the House and some members don't understand the impact that this could have. One of those is Florida Democrat Maxwell Frost, he's 27, the youngest member of Congress. I think that it is a violation of people's first amendment right. TikTok is a place for people to express ideas, I have many small businesses in my district and content creators in my district and I think it's going to drastically impact them too. You know, it's an election year so I guess I have to ask what are the presidential campaigns saying about all this? President Biden's campaign is on TikTok but the White House has said if the bill gets to his desk he will sign it. Former President Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, actually proposed a ban on TikTok in 2020 when he was in the White House but he recently reversed himself. He said he still has privacy concerns about the app but he's worried if it shuts down users are going to move to Facebook and an interview on CNBC this week he called Facebook the enemy of the people. If the bill makes it through the Senate and Biden signs it, it is expected to end up in court. TikTok has filed lawsuits to fight off other efforts to ban the app and federal courts so far have sided with their argument that blocking the app violates users' first amendment rights. And here's dear to your walls. Thank you. Thank you. It's now official Donald Trump and Joe Biden have each gotten their party's presidential nominations after yesterday's primaries so we could see more of what we've seen from Trump in his primary campaign. Touting, disproven conspiracy theories about non-citizens voting. These theories are not new in American politics. They've been around for more than a century despite studies and election officials saying it doesn't really happen. But with huge numbers of migrants crossing the southern border in recent months the narrative looks to be taking hold again in Republican circles. And here's Miles Parks covers voting and he has new reporting to share about this. Good morning, Miles. Hey, good morning. So Donald Trump has basically been talking about undocumented immigrants voting by the millions for quite a while but this year it's not just him, right? Right. Yeah, we're seeing influential conservatives behind the scenes starting to fixate on it as well. The PR acquired a two-page memo being circulated by an attorney named Clea Mitchell. She's a former Trump advisor and she's been influential in pushing all sorts of stolen election narratives since 2020. The memo is titled, quote, the threat of non-citizen voting in 2024 and it falls to implies that there are all these loopholes in the election system that undocumented immigrants are exploiting. Here's Mitchell talking about the broader conspiracy theory on a local conservative radio show in Illinois. I absolutely believe this is intentional and one of the reasons that the Biden administration is allowing all of these illegal supply to the country and they're taking them in the counties across the country so that they can get those people registered. They can vote them. Now, there is no evidence to support that theory and Mitchell did not respond to an email request for comment. But it's an idea we can expect to hear a lot this year as immigration is a major concern for Republican voters. So is this just xenophobia? I mean, what does the evidence actually show about non-citizens voting? Numerous studies can have confirmed it almost never happens. First of all, it is against the law for non-citizens to vote in federal elections and doing it would risk deportation. And in the few times that it has been shown that people have slipped through the cracks and registered or voted in federal elections, it's also been shown to have usually been by mistake. Okay, so I know you've also been looking into where and when these narratives started. What did you find? I mean, they've been around America politics for over a hundred years and I have to say I was kind of blown away as I started reporting this story at all the different times these same conspiracy theories have popped up, usually to justify policies that make voting harder. Even the very implementation of voter registration, researchers say it started in the late 1800s because people were specifically so scared about non-white, non-English speaking immigrants coming to the US and influencing politics. Experts who I talked to see echoes of that history in Trump's claims and in this memo by Mitchell, I talked to Guilda Daniels, who's an election law professor at the University of Baltimore. It's not only creates the hysteria, but this idea that only certain people should be allowed to participate in the process. In Mitchell's memo, for instance, she essentially says she wants Congress to make voter registration more difficult, but I should say there is essentially no chance that that goes anywhere at the federal level at this point. Okay, not nationally, but what about local state level? Yeah, so this is where it gets a little bit more complicated because a few liberal cities have passed laws in recent years allowing non-citizens to vote just in local races, which has led a number of Republican-led states to pass constitutional amendments banning those sorts of efforts. Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffinsberger has been one of the loudest voices raising concern on this issue, even though he's a Republican who has refuted a lot of other sort of conspiratorial narratives. He does say his confident non-citizens are not voting right now in Georgia, but when I asked him directly whether President Biden was shipping in undocumented immigrants to vote for him, he would not directly answer that, which just showed to me how deeply these ideas are rooted in conservative circles right now. And here's Miles Parks, thank you. Thank you. This week, the first age ship is due to arrive in Gaza from the island of Cyprus. It comes more than five months into the war between Israel and Hamas. Palestinian children in Gaza are starving to death, and the United Nations says most of the population there is at risk of famine. It's been really difficult to get food in because Israel's citing security concerns has blocked both shipments by land, so aid groups are now trying to use the sea. And here's Jane Raff joins us from Amman Jordan to talk about this. Hi, Jane. Hi, Lama. So what can you tell us about this ship headed to Gaza? Well, it's a boat called Open Arms after the Spanish aid organization that owns it. It set off yesterday, pulling a barge loaded with 200 tons of food, things like lentils, rice, canned meat. That's provided by a U.S. base state organization, World Central Kitchen and its partners. All of this painstakingly coordinated with Israel, which is scanned every package in Cyprus. The group is involved are keeping the exact destination on the Gaza coast and the timing of its arrival under wraps for security. But an Open Arms spokesperson told us because the vessel has to travel so slowly the trip could actually take several days. You know, Jane, the need is so great. Two million people in Gaza are risk of famine. What difference will this ship make? Well, by itself, not a huge amount. The food on it is really the equivalent of what could be carried by about ten trucks. The thing is, there are thousands of trucks backed up at the main border crossing with Gaza that have waited weeks for Israeli approval. This operation, though, is a test of the seerute and whether it can be scaled up to deliver a lot more aid. That would involve a jetty, which the aid groups involved say they're building now. I spoke with the founder of World Central Kitchen, who's in DC. It's Jose Andres, the celebrity chef. And his organization has been feeding people suffering through war and disaster for more than a decade. Let's listen to what he had to say. Nobody should never be attacked. Nobody should be killed by anybody that the civilian must be always be protected. And that obviously I report on what their East and Universal right. Andres says the biggest failure would be not trying to help feed people in Gaza. Okay. I've got non-governmental organizations trying to get in by sea. What are the U.S. and other countries doing to get aid in? Well, to become particularly urgent because of the scale of deaths and near starvation there. In fact, the European Union Foreign Policy Chief says starvation is being used as a weapon of war. So the U.S. military is planning to bring in a floating dock off the Gaza coast for more aid to be brought in by sea. We're not only are strikes of destroyed Gaza's ports, but that's certainly not easy, not least because the U.S. continues to supply Israel with its weapons for war and Gaza, making it a potential target. So critics say instead of building a dock, the U.S. should just pressure Israel to let in much more aid by trucks. But in the meantime, they love people in Gaza desperate for whatever they can get, however they can get it. And here's Jaina Raft. Thank you. Thank you. And that's up first for Wednesday, March 13th.

Plus house lawmakers prepare to vote on legislation that could ban TikTok in the US. This new bill has a lot of political momentum, and the legislators wrote it in a way that it might better withstand a legal challenge that stopped the other attempts to ban TikTok in the past. And we'll get the latest from Brussels as the EU takes on AI. It's Wednesday, March 13th. And here is the AM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories moving your world today. This year's presidential election is on track to become the first rematch since 1956. That's after President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump won enough delegates to secure their respective party's presidential nominations after they both won primaries in several states last night, including Georgia, Washington, and Mississippi. Trump will now establish a joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee, allowing the campaign to tap bigger contributions as the GOP looks to erase a fundraising deficit with Democrats. We are exclusively reporting that House Republicans are pushing their GOP colleagues to openly talk about their position on abortion, rather than sidestep the issue like many did in previous campaigns. And that not doing so is the \\\"worst possible solution.\\\" Congressional correspondent Natalie Andrews says, \\\"Abortion rights have weighed on the party's success in recent years and will be a key theme in the upcoming election.\\\" Republicans say, \\\"Tell voters where you stand. If it's a 15-week abortion ban, if it's a 24-week abortion ban, and that may help you connect to voters where some polls show that maybe they support more abortion rights than say an all-out ban on abortion.\\\" It is interesting, because in 2022, a lot of Republicans just didn't want to talk about the issue at all. They shied away. And a lot of them got in trouble because they talked about it in their primary and tried to seem conservative, and then there were all these sound bites from Republican debates floating out there. And then they didn't want to talk about it in the general election when they were up against a Democrat. The guidance will be presented to GOP colleagues tonight as the party kicks off its annual policy retreat in West Virginia. Meanwhile, House Democrats hoping to unstick USAID for Ukraine and Israel, have begun gathering signatures for a so-called discharge petition to force a vote on a more than $95 billion package passed by the Senate, but opposed by house speaker Mike Johnson. The effort requires support from just a simple majority of house members, but Democratic aides say they may need up to two dozen Republicans to back the move given expected Democratic defections over Israel policy. Speaking yesterday, Senate Minority Leader Republican, Mitch McConnell, joined Democrats in calling for swift action on the aid package. Mitch McConnell: Anything that's changed that's sent back here, as you all know, even the simplest thing can take a week in the Senate. We don't have time for all of this. We've got a bill that got 70 votes in the Senate, give members of the House of Representatives an opportunity to vote on it. That's the solution. In a stopgap move yesterday, the Biden administration said it's sending $300 million more in ammunition and other weapons to Ukraine as Congress debates its next steps. It is shaping up to be a critical day for TikTok as the US House of Representatives prepares to vote on legislation that could ban the popular app if it's Beijing-based owner doesn't sell it in the coming months. The bill is expected to pass the House, and possible investors are already circling TikTok. But as journal reporter, Stu Woo, is here to remind us, past efforts to rein in TikTok have hit a variety of hurdles, and this latest effort is far from over. Stu, could you just recap for us what exactly this bill being voted on today would do, and whether this represents maybe a new approach in how lawmakers are considering what to do with TikTok? Sure. The US House is voting on a bill that would force TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to either sell TikTok within six months, or if it doesn't, then it would effectively ban TikTok in the US. It would make it hard for app stores to offer TikTok. It would make it hard for internet providers to allow TikTok to be accessed in the US. This doesn't exactly represent a new approach in how Congress is approaching this. The main difference is that this new bill has a lot of political momentum, and the legislators wrote it in a way that it might better withstand a legal challenge that stopped the other attempts to ban TikTok in the past. How so? Congress last year introduced a few bills to ban TikTok, but they didn't really gain any momentum. Some of them died because there was political infighting, partisan politics, if you will, and others had some legal concerns that it might violate the First Amendment or other laws. So the legislators, when drafting the language for this bill, they brought in some constitutional experts to make sure, okay, if TikTok does sue to stop this attempt, they want to make sure that it can survive any lawsuit in the courts. How is ByteDance responding to this impending vote? Sure. ByteDance is doing what it has done in previous attempts. Number one, it's sending its lobbyists and its top executive, its CEO, to Congress to talk to lawmakers about why this is a bad idea. It's also mobilizing its TikTok celebrities to go out in public to say, \\\"Hey, you shouldn't do this. We depend on this for our livelihood, and this is about free speech.\\\" And also it did one new thing, which is it sent this notification to the phones of people who use TikTok. So when you open the app, it said, \\\"Congress wants to ban us. But if you press a couple buttons right now, you can call your Congress member and complain about this and say, 'Hey, don't do this. Don't ban TikTok.'\\\" We've reported that a sale of TikTok's US operations could fetch hundreds of billions of dollars, and yet it doesn't sound like that's something the company is engaging with. Sure, that's right. So yeah, TikTok could be worth tens or hundreds of billions of dollars. It has more than 170 million users in the US. But the issue here is that we don't think that ByteDance's owners, their Chinese co-founders, want to sell TikTok. And even if they wanted to, the Chinese government could stop that. The Chinese governments has export controls over TikTok's algorithm, the thing that shows you what video comes up next when you access TikTok. And that's up to the Chinese government to decide, okay, ByteDance, you aren't or are allowed to sell TikTok. So even if ByteDance were to agree to a sale, that too could be easier said than done. Yeah, there's a lot of complicated things here. So number one, does somebody want to buy TikTok? Now, my colleagues have reported that there are some potential buyers circling the wagons right now. TikTok could be really expensive. They have more than 170 million users. There's only a few companies out there that have the kind of money to buy them. The second problem with that is that there could be some anti-dress issues, especially in this Biden administration environments right now where they have been eager to stop big mergers. So a company that could afford to buy TikTok might face those concerns. All right, so should this bill clear the House, Stu, it's then onto the Senate. What would we be watching for there? So today the bill is widely expected to pass the US House. Both legislative aides and TikTok employees themselves believe that will happen easily. But both sides also think that when it goes to the Senate, it's going to face a much trickier path. No one knows what's going to happen there. And some senators, like Rand Paul of Kentucky, have already come out and said, \\\"We shouldn't ban TikTok.\\\" So a couple of senators could try to delay the bill. And another tricky thing is that the Senate might make some changes to the bill, then it would have to go back to the House. So there's definitely a far less clear path in the Senate compared with the US House today. And finally, Stu, even if this bill does clear Congress, the House and the Senate, and President Biden signs it as he said he would do. Another X factor here could be the courts, right, Stu? For instance, we saw a judge block a Montana bill that banned TikTok from going into effect, that too could be an outcome of all of this. Yeah, absolutely. So TikTok has indicated that they believe that this bill does amount to a ban, and that it would violate the First Amendment rights of its users. Now, that said, this bill was written by legislators with that in mind. So they brought in constitutional experts to write the language in a way that they think this would survive a court challenge on those grounds. So we'll see. Stu, thanks so much. Thanks, Luke. Coming up, historic new AI regulations are set to be approved today in Europe. We'll get the latest from Brussels, and look at the insights that a nearly $190 million diet study aims to unlock after the break. European Union lawmakers today are set to formally sign off on sweeping new rules on artificial intelligence. The Journal's Kim Mackrael is in Brussels. Kim, I understand that if all goes is planned today, the EU AI Act could go into effect later this year. Tell us what that bill would do. Yeah, so it's a pretty sweeping piece of legislation, and I think it's broadly being seen as a world first. Because although some other jurisdictions have pieces of AI legislation, this is thought to be, at least in the Western world, the first broad comprehensive attempt to legislate on artificial intelligence. And it covers quite a bit. I think maybe just thinking about it in three broad categories, there's prohibitions on certain behaviors. And so an example of that is using emotion recognition in the workplace or in a school environment. There are some new transparency rules for general purpose AI. And there are requirements for companies that make AI systems that are deemed to be high risk, to test and to do reporting on those systems. And Kim, there are also provisions in here for so-called deepfakes and around police use of AI, right? That's right. So for deepfakes, the idea is under the legislation, a deepfake, a manipulated photo of an existing place or people, that is supposed to be labeled as having been artificially manipulated. For policing, one of the ways this will take effect is a ban that exists on real-time biometric surveillance, but there are some narrow exemptions for how law enforcement can use some of these tools under fairly specific circumstances. And Kim, how is industry responding to this, the big tech companies that run many of these AI services? So there was quite a bit of lobbying. Some of the legislators who worked on this have said it was their biggest experience of lobbying, having worked on legislation over years. So there was quite a lot of interest, and a lot of lobbying from lobby groups that represent AI companies and from the AI companies themselves. There had been some threats last year about the possibility of AI companies simply not providing their products to the European market. As far as we're aware, there are no threats on the table along those lines now. And I think what you've seen is a lot of AI companies broadly accept that there will be some form of regulation. They've tried to influence what that will look like. I think there's some acceptance that the EU version of this regulation is coming through. There's not a lot that they can change about that now. They do have some time to adapt to it. One particular company's comment that might be helpful in thinking about how companies are responding to this is from Mistral AI, which is a French AI company, heavily involved in lobbying in relation to the AI Act. And their CEO had some concerns about what it would require companies to do. And he said recently after changes were made to the text, it would be a manageable burden for the company. He still thinks it goes farther than he would like it to, but he considers it to be manageable. That was the Journal's Kim Mackrael in Brussels. Kim, thanks so much. Thank you. Thanks so much. And finally, ultra-processed foods may not only affect our bodies, but our brains as well. That's according to new research that suggests that ultra-processed foods such as chips, snack bars, and breakfast cereals may be linked to changes in the way that we learn, remember, and feel. And it builds on recent studies that had already found that high-fat and sugar diets synonymous with many processed foods can increase the risk of depression and poorer memory performance. This comes as The National Institutes of Health has kicked off its most ambitious nutrition research project to date. And WSJ consumer health reporter, Andrea Petersen, told us that the $189 million study aims to look at how different people respond to different diets. Sometimes the advice is conflicting. Remember the low-fat movement, which was really found to actually not be healthy. So people can tend to be confused about what is actually the best thing for them, so that's part of the problem. Also, the chronic diseases related to our diets are on the rise. Scientists believe that actually people might be much more willing to follow a healthy diet if they're actually seeing that, \\\"Oh, hey, my blood sugar has gone down. My blood pressure has gone down because I'm following this diet.\\\" The NIH hopes the study will eventually enable Americans to receive personalized diet advice from their doctors. And that is What's News for Wednesday morning. Today's show was produced by Kate Bullivant and Hattie Moir. Our supervising producer is Sandra Kilhof. We will be back tonight with a new show. And until then, thanks for listening. Annmarie Fertoli : Bitcoin ETFs are struggling to get buy-in from financial advisors. If something were to happen with bitcoin, if it were to crash, that could really cause some sort of liability for the financial advisors. Annmarie Fertoli : And lobbyists turned to the Senate after the U.S house approves a bill to ban TikTok or force a sale of the app. Plus the European Central Bank makes a technical but consequential change affecting European banks. It's Wednesday, March 13th. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that move the world today. The European Central Bank has unveiled a rare makeover to the inner workings of monetary policy and a change that's important for the economy and investors. Reporter Tom Fairless says, \\\"The goal is to gradually reduce the ECB's footprint in the financial system by changing how the banks interact with it and each other.\\\" So it's a change that won't be seen by most businesses and households. It affects how the ECB gets its interest rates that it sets into the economy, how it engages with the banks and how the banks engage with each other for the interest rates to level off at the place where the ECB wants them. Now the interest rates have risen because there's this inflationary environment suddenly and central banks are reducing their bond holdings. They're shrinking the amount of money in the system. And in Europe, a lot of this transmission takes place through banks, and the banks really haven't lent to each other in a significant way since the global financial crisis. The trust broke down back then, and since then they've used the ECB as the intermediary. And this step by the ECB is an attempt to nudge banks back to a place where they can start lending to each other again. Annmarie Fertoli : The makeover has no bearing on the ECB's interest rate decisions. This is the first year some big companies like Duke Energy, and Whirlpool are taking a hit from a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax or CAMT. The tax targets companies with high profits and low taxes. It's supposed to act like a sort of backstop for companies averaging at least a billion dollars in financial statement profits over three years. But there's still some confusion over the new tax because the Treasury Department still hasn't detailed the rules for calculating it. Here now with more is our US tax policy reporter, Richard Rubin. Welcome back, Richard. Hey, thanks for having me. Annmarie Fertoli : Okay, so this tax, CAMT, was part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Is it working as intended? That's one thing we're still trying to figure out and we don't have a full picture. It took effect for calendar year companies starting with calendar year 2023, but the first tax returns actually won't be filed until later this year. We're in a very early stage of trying to figure out whether this thing is working. One thing we can say is it is requiring some companies to pay taxes that they otherwise would not have paid, and that's what we're seeing show up in the financial statements that companies have filed in the past couple of months. Annmarie Fertoli : And before we get to those financial statements, why hasn't the Treasury Department released the rules? This sounds pretty confusing. That's because the tax itself is confusing and complicated. So the Treasury Department is working on those rules. They're expected soon-ish. Those will be the proposed rules and then the companies will have, and others will have time to comment on them and then they'll be final rules. One would imagine that those should be done by the time the actual returns on extension are due later this year. But yeah, it has proven to be one of the more difficult regulatory projects that the Treasury Department has tried to do. Annmarie Fertoli : So how are big companies making due in the meantime? What are we finding out from their securities filings? So we're seeing a few things. We're seeing some companies say \\\"We're subject to CAMT,\\\" and I don't know what that means. I don't know whether that means they're above the billion dollar threshold and they're paying it or they're just above the billion dollar threshold and calculating their taxes both ways, but not paying it. Because the way this works is you calculate the regular corporate tax and you calculate the CAMT and then you pay whichever is higher. So we're seeing some of that. And then we're seeing some companies say KKR and Blackstone for example, \\\"We expect to pay CAMT,\\\" or, \\\"e are paying CAMT,\\\" but then they don't provide any detail on how much. And then we're seeing other companies, Whirlpool, Duke, Energy, a couple of financial companies actually disclose numbers and say, \\\"Okay, well this is how much of a liability we had for CAMT in 2023.\\\"Annmarie Fertoli : So what else is in store for the companies affected by CAMT? A couple things are worth emphasizing. One is what causes companies to go into CAMT is things like the treatment of stock-based compensation. And so that's different for gap and for tax, and that can cause companies to pay it. Another important thing to know is there are some tax breaks that are allowed under CAMT. There are some things that you still can do as a company to be really profitable and pay relatively little below 15%. And then the last thing I would add is that if you pay CAMT in 2023, say you pay $30 million in CAMT and then in 2024 you're back in the regular tax system and your regular tax is higher than your CAMT, you can use that 30 million to cover that cost. So in some ways it accelerates when companies are paying and you may see companies be in CAMT some years and out of CAMT other years. It is a devilishly complex tax added to a devilishly complex tax system. Coming up the price of bitcoin topped $73,000 today. And individual investors have poured billions of dollars into bitcoin ETFs since they launched in January. But why aren't the ETFs drawing in financial advisors? More after the break. Even dollar stores are starting to feel a squeeze from higher prices. Dollar Tree said it will close nearly 1,000 Family Dollar locations over the next few years. The company cited inflation, store theft and merger indigestion since it won the hard-fought battle to acquire Family Dollar, its one-time rival Back in 2015. Company executives said, \\\"Persistent Inflation and reduced government benefits are putting more pressure on customers, especially those at lower income levels.\\\" McDonald's also said it's cash-strapped consumers are pulling back. At an investor conference the company's finance chief said Lower-income. Consumers are increasingly spending their savings and opting for grocery stores instead of restaurants. McDonald's says it's rolling out promotions and bundle deals in response. And while we're on the topic of higher prices, let's face it, we're paying more at the grocery store and restaurants these days. We'd like to hear from you.

There was a lot of attention around the launch of bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January and bitcoin has been on a rally topping $73,000 today. The bitcoin ETFs allow everyday investors to buy the digital assets directly through their brokerage accounts instead of indirectly like going through a crypto exchange or to funds that track bitcoin's price through futures contracts. Since the launch, individual investors have poured billions of dollars into these ETFs, but the ETFs target market, financial advisors who oversee trillions of dollars in client assets, are still on the sidelines. So why aren't they buying in here now? Welcome back Vicki. Thank you for having me. Annmarie Fertoli : Okay, so why are financial advisors staying out right now? So a lot of these financial advisors, they work in the wealth management divisions of big banks like Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, JP, Morgan, Wells, Fargo, et cetera. And in order to sell these bought bitcoin ETFs and pitch them to their customers, that would require approval from these wealth management platforms. And so far that has not come down yet. Annmarie Fertoli : So why the reluctance? We all know that bitcoin is a very volatile asset and adding a spot bitcoin ETF to a customer's portfolio could really shift the risk profile of a portfolio. So if something were to happen with a bitcoin, that could really cause some sort of liability for the financial advisors. Some institutions such as smaller registered investment advisory firms, hedge funds and other institutions have bought the spot bitcoin ETFs. And if clients were to ask their financial advisors to buy the spot bitcoin ETFs for them, they can still do that. Annmarie Fertoli : I would think the current rally would be an incentive for more financial advisors to get involved, but it doesn't seem to be having that effect. I've talked to some financial advisors and it's true, a lot of them are getting a lot of client inquiries about all kinds of questions about accessing Bitcoin. And it seems like right now many wealth management platforms are taking a wait and see approach, or they're doing due diligence on these spot bitcoin ETFs to see if they can be added to the wealth management platform. But the price surge has definitely generated a lot of interest in retail customers. Annmarie Fertoli : If financial advisors continue to stay on the sidelines, what could that mean for the future of Crypto ETFs, which were really hailed as a game changer when they launched? Financial advisors who collectively oversee by some estimates $30 trillion in client assets in the United States. As expected, house lawmakers have overwhelmingly approved a bill that would ban TikTok from operating in the US or force a sale of the company. The measure calls for TikTok's parent, the Chinese company ByteDance to divest itself from the platform or face a ban from app stores and web hosting services in the US. Lawmakers have said TikTok's ownership potentially gives Beijing a way to collect data on Americans and influence public opinion. The short video app has also faced scrutiny over the way its algorithm selects content to show users. A TikTok spokeswoman says, \\\"The ban is based on zero evidence.\\\" Critics of the bill say it unfairly singles out TikTok it now heads to the Senate where its fate is more uncertain. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has declined to say whether he would bring it up for a vote. President Biden has said he would sign the bill if it reached his desk. A Georgia judge has dismissed six counts in the election interference indictment, former President, Donald Trump, and five co-defendants. The counts were related to allegations Trump and others, including former lawyer Rudy Giuliani illegally tried to influence the state's elected officials to violate their oaths of office in attempts to unlawfully influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. In total, 35 counts remain in the indictment. A representative for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis didn't immediately respond to request for comment. Willis is facing a motion to be disqualified from the case on misconduct allegations. And that's what's news for this Wednesday afternoon. Today's show was produced by Anthony Bansie and Pierre Bienaim, with supervising producer Michael Kosmides. We'll be back with a new show tomorrow morning. Thanks for listening.\",\" Today, Biden looks towards November for the state of the Union address as the Fed chair faces lawmakers. Gone as anti-LGBTQ bill could end up costing its economy. And Dengie is making a comeback. It's Thursday, March 7th. This is Reuters World News, bringing you everything you need to know from the front lines in 10 minutes, every weekday. I'm Jonah Green in New York, and I'm Kim Vannell in London. Niki Haley's voters are up for grabs and the uncommitted are waiting to be convinced. The stakes are high for President Joe Biden in tonight's state of the Union address. White House reporter Trevor Honeycott will be watching along. Trevor, what should we expect? So the president has eight months until his reelection bid goes before voters, and he's got a lot of work to do between now and then. He's got a base that splintered. He's got rampant concerns among voters about not just his age, but also some of his policies. And he's going up against an opponent who's been out of the public eye and seems to have benefited from that. And so this is a really good opportunity for him to make his case for another four years. And given where his poll numbers are at, it seems like a lot of voters will need some convincing. And so how will he do that? I mean, what are the policies he's going to try to highlight? Sure. Well, voters are saying that they're really concerned about immigration and they're really concerned about the economy. So you can expect that those two things are going to be at the top of the list for Biden. He's going to talk probably about how Republicans rejected a border deal that Biden was willing to agree to. His hope is that tacking right on that issue is going to be helpful for him with voters. He's going to talk about what he's doing to lower costs for Americans, given their concerns about inflation and prices. So you'll see a lot of things items around health care and probably junk fees and different initiatives that the administration is taking to lower costs for the American people. So those will be some of the big issues. In case our listeners forgot, this was the rowdy crowd Biden face last year. Let me give you anybody who died. Do you know anything about preparation? Is he getting coached with a a Marjorie Taylor green look alike yelling at him in the over. So so Biden is doing a lot of preparation, you know, for this he's been spending days and weeks of time with some of his senior aides. He was at Camp David over the weekend with a group of people who've been with him for years and years and years and kind of understand his tone of voice, his perspective, how he thinks through political issues and political challenges and they've ball been kind of passing drafts back and forth and editing and Biden spokesperson Karin Jompier says that he's going to be fine tuning until the day of the event. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. He's also a hot topic for Fed chair Jerome Powell during testimony on Capitol Hill. Powell says it remains unclear when the central bank may cut interest rates, but insist the US economy is on a good path to a soft landing. Fed watcher Howard Schneider has been watching his words. So Howard, what was Powell's big message to lawmakers? So big message was that, you know, this economy is growing. The unemployment rates low. The Fed expects inflation to continue to fall and they still expect if things evolve as they anticipate to be cutting rates later this year. Now when that starts and how far still to be determined and as Powell cautioned as he always does, the economic outlook is uncertain and ongoing progress toward our 2% objective for inflation is not assured. So they'll be watching this data and still have sort of an intact projection expectation that rates will fall this year, but didn't give any hint on how soon that might be. And as North Carolina representative Patrick McKinney, a Republican noted, we're a political year. It's an election year. Did Powell give any indication as to how he'll navigate these political pressures? Well, the operative response there was that, yeah, he and his colleagues planned to quote unquote, keep our heads down and stick to the data, stick to their knitting, look at what the incoming information indicates about the decline of inflation if it's evolving as they expect. As he said, there's RISOMBOS side, but yeah, they don't want to get in the crossfire between Trump and Biden, even though inevitably it seems the outcomes of their decisions are going to shape the landscape between those 2. Three people have been killed in a hoody missile attack on a Red Sea merchant ship. It's the first fatalities reported since the Iran-aligned Yemeni group began their campaign of strikes. All right, 29 hours, one day Senate Bill 159, the Senate concurrs. Alabama lawmakers pass a bill to protect IVF providers from lawsuits and criminal prosecution. In a KIV signed the bill into law, after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled frozen embryos should be considered children, pushing at least 3 IVF providers to stop procedures. The program that resettles Afghans who worked with the U.S. government into the U.S. could soon hit the limit set by Congress. And it's unlikely the divided Congress will approve the Biden administration's request for 20,000 more special immigration visas which offer a path to U.S. citizenship, thus stranding tens of thousands who are at risk of Taliban retribution. A new report sheds light on what may have happened to Reuters reporter Isam Abdullah who was killed in Lebanon. An Israeli tank fired shells at a group of journalists and then, quote, likely, opened fire on them with a heavy machine gun in an attack lasting 1 minute and 45 seconds. The report by the Netherlands organization for applied scientific research was contracted by Reuters to analyze the evidence from the October 13 attack. Reuters president says an anti-LGBTQ bill passed by parliament last week has yet to cross his desk and is subject to a Supreme Court challenge. But the stakes for the tiny West African country are high. An internal government memo seen by Reuters says the bill could cost the country $3.8 billion in World Bank financing. Rachel Savage covers markets and economics in Sub-Saharan Africa. Rachel, what could this anti-LGBTQ push cost Ghana? So Ghana is currently recovering from a very deep economic crisis. It is restructuring its debt. It has a $3 billion three year IMF loan program and that IMF loan is predicated on Ghana having additional international financial support, including from the World Bank. Now the World Bank suspended new funding for Uganda last year after Uganda passed a very harsh anti-LGBTQ bill. So the worry here for Ghanaians is that the World Bank will similarly suspend new funding in Ghana. However, the World Bank hasn't yet responded to Reuters' request to comment at the time of recording this podcast. You mentioned Uganda. What's been the effect of the suspension bill? So so far the World Bank suspending new funding in Uganda hasn't had any impact in Uganda. Their anti-LGBTQ bill is still law and the President Masevani and other U.N. politicians have been very firm in saying that it's Uganda's choice and they will continue with this law in place. However, in Ghana's case, the President hasn't fully expressed support either way for the bill. Brazil's most populated state, Sao Paulo, has declared a health emergency over the surge in cases of dengue fever. This year a record 1.2 million cases have been reported so far with cases also spreading to Argentina and Paraguay. Global Health reporter Jennifer Rigby has been looking at what's causing this spread. So dengue is a disease spread by mosquitoes and the kind that carry dengue thrive in hot and wet conditions, which is what El Nino in South America at the moment and climate change have brought to those countries. But it's not just South America, it's on the rise around the world and it has been for a few years. Climate change is already having a really big impact on human health in all sorts of different ways, including things that are simple like really, really hot weather, puts people under heat stress, particularly vulnerable people. But then also more complicated ways, infectious diseases are spreading to new areas and dengue is a worry because it kills people.\",\" A critical test tonight for President Biden before a joint session of Congress has he sets up for his rematch with Donald Trump. What is the state of Biden's presidency on the morning of the state of the Union address? Alabama passes a law protecting in vitro fertilization clinics from civil and criminal liability weeks after the state Supreme Court gave frozen embryos the same rights as children, so we'll treat them and start up again. Israel's deadly military response in Gaza following a Hamas attack on Israel enters its six month. We take a look at the way it's changed Israeli society. On October 7th, something cracked or maybe broke into Israeli psyche. Stay with us. We've got the news you need to start your day. It's an election year and a long one at that.

Some good stories come out of Washington, but most come out of communities like yours, far from the capital. Here and now any time is a podcast that taps into local newsrooms from Maine to San Diego to bring you stories that matter. Close to your community and find common ground with people around the world. It is among the most famous backdrops in American politics. The president speaking to a joint session of Congress. And tonight it'll feature Joe Biden. So you can reassure voters he is ready and able to serve a second term. Biden delivers the annual state of the Union address as America gets ready for a matchup they've seen before between Biden and former president Donald Trump. Hi, Tam. Good morning. So what are you expecting to hear from the president tonight? President Biden is going to talk about what his administration has accomplished and what he still wants to get done. Topps on that list includes urging Republicans in the House to support aid to Ukraine. He's also going to tell Congress he needs funding to help secure the border. Our colleague Steven Skipe spoke with Biden's chief of staff, Jeff Zines, who says there will also be a discussion of the war in Gaza, which will include showing support for Israel and going into some depth about the suffering of Palestinian civilians. But much of the focus tonight will be domestic and forward-looking. This is what Zines told Steve. Lowering costs continue to make people's lives better by investing in childcare, elder care, paid family and medical leave, continued progress on student debt. But I think importantly, the president is also going to call for restoring Roe versus Wade. Now, Biden is going to be speaking to a room full of congressional Republicans who've been blocking him and nearly every turn for the past year and a half. Does the White House really think these proposals will become law? They're still holding out hope for Ukraine. Otherwise this is very much a second term agenda if Democrats are to control Congress. This is truly Biden's first speech of what is going to be a difficult 2024 general election fight. As of yesterday, former president Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee. So even if he doesn't make it explicit, Biden is using this address to make his pitch to the American people for four more years. And this speech is likely going to be policy-heavy, but performance is almost more important. That's what Sarah DiPeri told me. She was a speech writer for former president Barack Obama. It is one thing to sort of say. I am the person who is fighting for you, but if you appear as though you don't have a lot of fight in you, that's not particularly compelling to people who want that. And so I think what he did so well last year was just come out swinging. And she's talking about the moment at last year's state of the union where Biden had this raucous back and forth with Republicans over social security. Heading into the speech last year, a lot of people, including Democrats, had many of the same questions we're hearing now about Biden's stamina and age. After that speech, a lot of those questions faded, at least for a while, but it's very much back in the forefront now. Can this one speech actually make a difference? This day the union certainly gets outsized attention. I was talking to voters earlier this week. And they told me people from both parties that they do have concerns about whether Biden has it in him for another four years. Republicans were openly questioning his mental competency. So will this one speech solve all that for the president? Probably not. But if he does have a chance to go off script and improvise, it might go a long way to reassure Democratic voters at least who are worried. And P.R. Tamerkeeth, thank you, Tim. You're welcome. In vitro fertilization providers in Alabama are expected to resume services as soon as today. And that is because Alabama Governor Kay Ivey signed a bill that was rushed into law after a controversial state Supreme Court ruling. It ends nearly three weeks in limbo for both IVF providers and the families they serve. And P.R. Debbie Elliott joins us from Montgomery, Alabama. Good morning, Debbie. Morning. So you were at the State House last night to watch the debate over this law. What is it intended to do? Well, it's intended to provide criminal and civil immunity for IVF providers and the families they served. They had been pushing for this after that ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court last month that basically gave frozen embryos the same rights as children. What this law does not do is address the whole question of whether stored embryos should get the same kind of protections that in utero fetuses do under Alabama's strict abortion ban. And the ramifications that that could then have for how doctors and families use their embryos. So what passed last night is basically a stopgap measure. It's intended to make IVF treatment available again. And the sense of urgency to get it done was underscored by the fact that the governor immediately signed it into law despite the late hour last night. So basically providers wanted to feel protected in doing these types of procedures. I mean, is this stopgap having the desired effect? What a provider saying they'll do? It appears to the biggest IVF provider in the state is the University of Alabama of Birmingham, a major medical center. It says it will resume treatments. Another provider, Alabama fertility operates in three cities. It says it welcomes the legislation and actually has patients scheduled to have embryo transfers today. Families who were undergoing IVF had been a constant presence at the state house pressing for this. I spoke last night with Karen O'Brien with the fight for Alabama Families Coalition. She's pregnant after having an embryo transfer in January and says these last few weeks have just been devastating for women who were left in a lurch now that they have scored this victory with the immunity law. They plan to use that momentum and push for a constitutional amendment to address the underlying question posed by the Supreme Court ruling. An embryo outside of the uterus is potential life and not an unborn child or unborn life. But that question still unsettled. A national industry group says the Alabama bill still leaves fertility doctors and their patients at risk. A statement from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine says the legislation is still a problem because there's still this sense that fertilized eggs are scientifically and legally equivalent to children. Is there any indication from Alabama lawmakers that they might try to address that broader issue raised by the Supreme Court ruling? Well everybody says they'd like to but honestly the path to get there is a bit murky. That's something that Republican Senator Tim Nelson acknowledges he's a physician from North Alabama and sponsored and fast-tracked this law. I think there's just too much difference of opinion on when actual life begins. A lot of people say conception. A lot of people say implantation. There's others that say heartbeat. I wish I had the answer. Nelson says the obstacle is making sure that the debate would be based on science and not gut feelings from politicians about when life begins. So certainly a very tricky issue. And Pierre is Deve Elliott. Thanks Deve. You're welcome. Today marks five months since October 7th and the surprise Hamas assault on Israel. Palestinian lives in Gaza are forever changed by Israel's deadly military response. Israeli lives have changed as well and the state of Israeli society is crucial to understanding where this war might lead. And Pierre's Daniel Estran has been reporting on this and joins us from Tel Aviv. Good morning Daniel. Good morning Leila. So October 7th we know was the deadliest day for Israel in its history. The Israeli military response has been the deadliest war Palestinians in Gaza have ever faced. How are Israelis feeling five months into this war? Israelis are living their lives unhold. 94,000 Israelis are still evacuated from their homes along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon. It's not just them. I met with an October 7th survivor of a door shortman. On October 7th something cracked or maybe broke into Israeli psyche. Even those that weren't there just saw it on TV. They are still there. Now he was actually there in one of the attacked communities his in-laws were killed and his family has only now moved from a hotel to a trailer park to house all these broken families. And a lot of these families he says will not move to new homes being built for them until the hostages are freed. There are more than 130 Israelis still held in Gaza many still believe to be alive. And so these families don't want the Israeli government to think that they're moving on until those hostages are released. And it's just a whole sense Leila that the entire country is in a state of suspended animation. State of suspended animation. Now there is a lot of alarm globally about the way Israel has conducted its response. But what do Israelis think? There is a consensus here that the war should continue until Hamas has no capability to threaten Israel. Israelis are largely unified now in support of the war. Together we will win is the slogan that you see everywhere. I mean, even displayed on highway signs along with the traffic reports. Many Israelis will tell you it's unfair of the world to expect them to show restraint in Gaza after the October 7 attack. And you also hear from Israelis who used to believe in some peace deal with Palestinians one day that they've lost all trust in that now. I spoke with an Israeli lawyer Adi Peshko Kuts. I believe we had before October 7th, we were just wrong. We were just naive. You know, a lot of Israelis are angry at the world for seeing Israel as the aggressor against Palestinians and not as a victim defending itself. Now, Daniel, you've been reporting on this war for months now. What changes have you seen among Israelis and in Israel? You see a lot of guns, Leila. I mean, one of the most profound changes is that many Israelis no longer believe they can depend on their army alone. They saw what happened October 7th civilians were under attack for an entire day before help arrived. And so 900 volunteer armed squads have been mobilized across Israel to patrol cities. Israel says Hamas has been greatly weakened by its military operation. What are Israelis most concerned about now? They're concerned about Lebanon. Hasbala in Lebanon is a much more formidable enemy than Hamas is. Hasbala has longer range missiles that could paralyze Israel and knock out the electricity grid. So Israeli families are buying generators just in case and many army reservists are being told to report for duty just in case there's war. And Pierre's Daniel Estran in Tel Aviv. Thank you, Daniel. You're welcome. And that's the first for Thursday, March 7th. I'm Leila Faldon. Enemy Martinez.

More voters will cast ballots today than on any other day in the primaries. I definitely think he's business minded and I think our economy needs that. She's talking of Donald Trump, so will he clinch victory effectively today? The former president also gets a big legal victory. The Supreme Court says states like Colorado can't kick him off the primary ballot for his actions on January 6th. I think it will go a long way toward bringing our country together. Why was this unanimous ruling still contentious? Also a New United Nations report looks at some of the most sensitive allegations about the October 7th attacks on Israel by Hamas. Where Israelis who were taken hostage victims of sexual violence stay with us who got the news you need to start your day. You have the power to stay connected with the speed you need on all your connected devices. Learn more at Cox.com. It's all fair game for good conversation. Many American states and one territory released their voting results on this super Tuesday. As a public service we are going to tell you which ones they are. Here goes Alabama Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia. Democrats in American Samoa hold caucuses. Democrats in Iowa release the results of their presidential preference caucus. President Biden has few challenges on the democratic side while Donald Trump still has one. Nikki Haley is still appealing for votes. Nikki Makalco of Caroline County Virginia is leaning toward the joint she made last time. I definitely think we need a change. I supported Trump in the past. I agree with some of his policies. I definitely think he's business minded and I do agree with a lot of that as well. And I think our economy needs that. Don, good morning. Good morning. Could this be the last day for serious competition? Well, it's, you know, it's possible. It's possible. But again, you have to break it down on each side. And on the Republican side former President Donald Trump has a commanding lead in delegates so far and in polling over former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. She has pledged to stay in the race at least through today. But Steve is recently as yesterday. She was still sending announcements about supporters and staffers and states yet to come down the road. So ultimately, we will see what she is all about. And her campaign is all about after the polls close tonight. Well, this is very interesting. If you've got the money and if you've got the will, you can go on. Even if you think your odds are low. And this is something that candidates have done in primaries before. So given that, what do you think about when you hear people say that tonight could effectively be the start of the general election? Well, you know, we've also certainly got President Biden facing some minor challenges, but he's won every state so far. Tonight, you know, there's the math, but there's also a probability. So as far as the math goes, the earliest, they can each clinch the nomination outright is later this month for Trump. It could happen March 12th for Biden. It's a week later. Though both again, are already seen as likely nominees barring some major unforeseen development. And those can happen. Voters we talked to I should add overwhelmingly are already looking toward a 2020 rematch between Biden and Trump. Okay. So add a two-dolley people are there, but there's a question of how much major candidates might be damaged or or are bumped up a little bit or bumped around a little bit before we're done. What are you looking at done if you go down ballot elsewhere on the ballot? That's where it gets interesting for geeks, right? In California, there's a US Senate race long held by the late Senator Diane Feinstein, the two top vote getters today advanced to the general election regardless of party. So it could be two Democrats running against one another in the fall for that seat. North Carolina has a gubernatorial race. We'll be watching closely and Alabama redistricting. So we're watching all that. And Piers Don Gagne, thanks for your insights. It's always really appreciated. It's a pleasure. The Supreme Court has ruled on the meaning of the Constitution's 14th Amendment. The court ruled that Colorado may not remove Donald Trump from its primary ballot because of his role in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. A clause of the 14th Amendment bars people from office if they took an oath to the US and then engaged in insurrection. But this raised a big question for the justices, who decides which people are disqualified? The unanimously said that states like Colorado may not may not do it. Good morning. Good morning Steve. What does this mean for Trump? It's a pretty major victory for Donald Trump. The Supreme Court decided unanimously individual states cannot disqualify federal candidates under the Constitution's insurrection clause. And that wiped away decisions by Colorado and Maine and Illinois to yank Trump from the ballot. Those and other state challenges are now dead on arrival. Here's how Donald Trump responded yesterday. I think it will go a long way toward bringing our country together, which our country needs. The conservative court majority took a pretty significant step. They said Congress would have to pass a special law that would apply to Trump if lawmakers want to make clear he didn't qualify for office because of the siege on the Capitol. And it really seems unlikely this Congress will do that before the November election. You know, Kerry, you've had this experience too. It's kind of great. You get a Supreme Court ruling. You start reading. You get what the top line is and then you begin reading the details and the other stuff. It was talking with our colleague Nina Tottenberg yesterday and realized that she was talking that while they were unanimous these justices, they were not unanimous on everything. What did they disagree about? Yes, the three liberal justices accused this majority of overreaching and violating the principle of judicial restraint. The court majority could have just said giving states the power to disqualify a presidential candidate would create chaos, a messy batch work in states, but instead the majority went farther and imposed new limits on which kinds of federal actors can enforce the law and how they can do that. The liberal justices Sonia Soda-Major, Elena Kagan and Katangi Brown Jackson said the conservatives had, quote, tried to insulate the court in this petitioner, Donald Trump, from future controversy. And then Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed by Trump, wrote separately, she said the majority didn't need to go so far, but she also said in this volatile election season, the court should turn the temperature down not up. Maybe a reference to some of the heated language from the liberals. In effect, they had an argument themselves over who decides, who gets to say how far you can go in interpreting the 14th Amendment. Carrie, I have to ask about yet another Supreme Court case that involves the former president. What is happening with the question of his claim of immunity? The justices are going to hear that dispute over whether Trump has absolute immunity in late April. This stems from the criminal case against Donald Trump, or they did in January 6th. Now the justices could have speeded up the schedule and agreed to hear this issue last December, when prosecutors first asked them to do so. But instead, the Supreme Court waited for a lower court to rule and then took more than two weeks to decide to hear the case. The delay leaves a huge question about whether a jury is going to have enough time to hear the evidence and deliver a verdict before the November election. It's still technically possible, but very difficult every day counts here and how long the justices take to write that opinion couldn't make or break the DC trial. Okay, we will keep watching with suspense. Carrie, thanks so much. My pleasure. And Pierce, Carrie Johnson. The United Nations has released an investigation of the Hamas attack on Israel last October 7th. It is a report on sexual violence, and this is where we want to advise you that some people may find what we're about to talk about for the next few minutes disturbing. The allegations of sexual violence against the attacks perpetrators have been very contentious. The New York Times, for example, has been criticized in recent days over its reporting about it. Now, UN investigators offer their own view, finding, quote, reasonable grounds to believe, unquote, that Israelis were victims of sexual violence that day. And, Pierce Becky Sullivan is covering this story. Becky, good morning. Good morning. Who are the investigators and what did they do? Yeah, so this report was led by the United Nations Special Representative for Sexual Violence and Conflict. Her name is Pamela Patton. And she had a team of about nine UN staff members that included a forensic expert and specialist in sexual violence investigations. And they went to Israel and they reviewed 5,000 photos and 50 hours of video evidence, and they interviewed dozens of people, witnesses and first responders and medical staff. And in total, they don't put a number on how often this happened, but they do ultimately conclude that rapes were likely to have taken place in at least three different locations on October 7th, including the site of the Nova Rave. And they were also able to talk to released hostages, and they got first-hand accounts of what they say could be ongoing sexual violence by captors in Gaza. And so they called for a ceasefire to release those hostages. Hamas now has strongly rejected this report, we should say. This is a highly politicized topic. People are making very intense points, having to do with the allegations of sexual violence, and also pushing back against the allegations of sexual violence. Did this UN report address that? Yeah, the report is very detailed about the challenges that they and other investigators have run into, looking into this topic, including the lack of survivor accounts, because no survivor of sexual assault that day has publicly come forward. Here's Pamela Patton, the reports author. On the very first, they made a call for survivors to come forward, but we received information that a handful of them were receiving very specialized trauma treatment, and were not prepared to come forward. There's also a relative lack of physical, forensic evidence due to a lot of factors that the report details, including the sheer scale of attack and Israeli officials prioritizing the identification of bodies instead of collecting evidence, that kind of thing. And so where the inaccurate stories come in is that many of these really accounts, the really kind of outlandish ones, came from soldiers or first responders who weren't trained in medicine or forensics, and so they misinterpret what they're seeing. That's what the report says. The team behind the report says, you know, they had a lot of accounts to look into. Some they weren't able to verify, and others they found were uncounted. Okay, so some stories, in fact, are not credible, because they're dealing with the complexity of truth here. Some of them are more credible, and in fact, isn't there some photographic evidence that can be shown here? Yeah, I mean, they looked at 5,000, but we in PR myself reviewed about 20 photos taken by first responders of bodies found at the rave, and in some of the small communities that were attacked, that show the remains of at least 20 or so victims. And so those included women who were found in various states of undress, multiple people found with their hands tied, and some with very obvious injuries like gunshot wounds to the pelvic area, which I should say the report couldn't currently identify a pattern there, but they say it weren't future investigation. Taken in total, how does this add to what was known about that day? Well, so this is the most comprehensive report yet on the issue of sexual violence that has been issued by an independent body outside of Israel. So that's significant, but it's still only 24 pages long, and the team of researchers was only there for about two weeks. And so, you know, what they say is that a fully-fledged investigation, full team of investigators there for a long time is what's needed. Israel hasn't fully allowed that yet. They accused the UN of an anti-Israel bias. Wait a minute. So Israel accused the UN of bias, but the UN report substantiated broadly speaking with Israel's claims of sexual violence here. That's right. And Israel's ambassador to the United Nations doubled out on that yesterday, saying that the five months it took for this to come out since October 7th is evidence of their shameful delay essentially.

That would effectively end the presidential primary and clear the way for a rematch between Trump and Joe Biden. Voters also chose nominees in down ballot races. In California, for example, a prominent Democratic Senate candidate spent millions of dollars to boost a Republican opponent. Why did he do that? And how did it pay off?

Donald Trump will almost certainly be the Republican nominee for president once again. November 5th is going to go down as the single most important day in the history of our country. Trump spoke at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Florida, after largely sweeping the Super Tuesday states. That leaves Trump free to focus on his once and future opponent, Joe Biden, who swept the Super Tuesday states on the Democratic side. Good morning. What do you make of this development? It was going in the wrong direction for Nikki Haley. She said after Michigan, which was, what, let's do the math. It feels like weeks ago, but it was a few days back. Exactly. That she was in through Super Tuesday. Here we are. The map yesterday is really telling, right? In places like Iowa, early on, Michigan, New Hampshire, she was in the high 30s, even in the 40% range in some cases. The map yesterday with the exception of Vermont was she carried with 49%. There was a lot of 17% against Donald Trump, 19%, 15% in Oklahoma. It was just clear to her that this is the end of the line. So we'll get this announcement today and it still raises a lot of questions. Yeah. Let's talk about one of the questions. She is going to in some fashion. Now it's clear that he's got the votes of the majority of Republican voters, but there is that slice of people who have said in interviews and in exit polls that they were for Haley at least in part because they had serious concerns about Donald Trump as a presidential candidate once again. And there is going to be a lot, I think we can expect this fall of candidates on both sides or surrogates on both sides, essentially saying you may not like our guy, but the other guy is so terrible. You just got to, you just got to that's going to be the Republican appeal. And honestly, in some cases, the Democratic appeal, isn't it? Exactly. Exactly. And that's what I've been hearing all along and we'll see if that changes at all. It's also a question of turnout, whether or not they are enthused enough to vote at all. Okay. Okay. Let's continue our conversation now with the former Republican governor of Arkansas, who was also a presidential candidate himself, Asa Hutchinson. Welcome back to the program. Good morning, sir. Well, thank you, Steve. It is great to be with you today. I know that you had been supportive of Nikki Haley up to now. What do you make of the announcement that we expect a little bit later on this morning? Well, she's a smart lady and obviously can read the tea leaves last night was not a good night for her. It was a very strong night for a Donald Trump. And so one, I'm very glad that she stayed in through Super Tuesday. It was important for a large number of states, what, 16 last night to be able to cast their vote and to have an alternative. And clearly the Republican base is in Donald Trump's camp, but Nikki ran a good race and she timed it well now to make a decision to suspend her campaign. There really wasn't any choice. And so now we'll see just as the previous analysis went exactly where her supporters go. And I think that remains up in the air exactly how what she does as well as others who supported her. Well, let's, let's talk about what you might do as one Nikki Haley supporter. There is the third party option. There's the not voting option. What are you thinking? Well, it is important that the burden is on Donald Trump to unify the party and to reach out and to bring people together in the Republican column. That's hard for him to do. And he's not been very successful of that in the past. So in terms of me, I fit in the column that I can't endorse Donald Trump. There's nothing I see that he reflects my views of the Republican party, the role of the United States of America abroad, the importance of controlling spending in the federal government. All of these issues, I don't see Donald Trump being effective. And so I'm withholding my support from Donald Trump as well. Now as to what I do, that remains to be seen. But I want to see how Nikki Haley, what her comments are today. But I think I'll be with a lot of people that just say Donald Trump would be a risk for the United States of America. Do you have any faith that if elected that former President Trump would respect the law and respect the democratic system that we have? I think there's a high risk that he would assume more powers than our Constitution gives the executive branch. In other words, I think there are risks there last night was a good example in some ways that he just wanted an incredible election across multiple states. And his victory speech included attacking the election system, saying it's a third world country that we have. And so as a lawyer or a former federal prosecutor, I don't like him undermining the rule of law that we have, our institutions of democracy, but also our system of law that we have in the courts. And so the other is risk to that. I think there's a lot of unknown there. He plays a very cagey in terms of what he says. He wants to be a dictator for one day. What does that mean? Does he really mean that? So yes, there's risks that I'm concerned about. And that's where independent voters are going to be concerned. And Donald Trump, he wants to win, has to be able to expand beyond the base, to go after independent voters, and to make sure that he has a message that makes him feel comfortable in supporting him. I'm sure that there is a list of issues a mile long where you disagree with President Biden or disagree with the way that he has conducted himself in office, but does he pose that same kind of danger to the system that you just described with Donald Trump? Well, it's different. And I'm not going to support Joe Biden. I look at his failed policies from energy security to our foreign policy to particularly our border and spending too much, the economic side of all of those reasons. I think he has his own set of risk. And you can say that if we have a week's other than border, that's a risk to our democracy as well. So it's a different set of risk. So I have to look at it both in terms of I'm a Republican. I've been a historic supporting the party. And it's a big deal not to offer that endorsement to Donald Trump. Governor, thanks very much. It's always a pleasure talking with you. Really appreciate it. Stay great to be with you today. Thanks so much. Asa Hutchinson was himself a Republican presidential candidate. And before that was the Republican governor of Arkansas. Now our correspondent Don Gagne has been listening along with us here. And Don, let's think this through. Isn't this something that Republicans have struggled with a lot? Republicans who have public or in many cases private concerns about Donald Trump but seem to struggle with what exactly what else to do? Absolutely. The conversation you just had with former governor Hutchinson, a series of former governor, he's a former presidential candidate. I've had that exact same conversation with so many voters across the country. People have been wrestling this with this since the earliest days of Donald Trump as a political figure in the country. Obviously, it is a settled question for Governor Hutchinson. But a lot of people are still wrestling with what they do coming November. Don, thanks as always for your insights. Really appreciate it. A pleasure. She'll make a statement a little bit later on this morning. Next we head down the ballot from the presidential race to a US Senate primary with a bit of a twist. California voters picked two finalists to replace the late Senator Diane Feinstein in a seat that is open for the first time since 1992. And the Democratic finalist found a way to choose his opponent. Marisa Lagos covers California politics for Member Station KQED and is with us now. Good morning. Good morning. All right. Tell us which two candidates made the runoff. The Democrats are going to be representative Adam Schiff. He has represented parts of Los Angeles in the House for more than two decades. And he led the first impeachment inquiry into former President Trump in 2019. And he's really made pushing back against Trump in quote, saving democracy a centerpiece of his campaign. On the GOP side, we have former Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Steve Garvey, who retired in 1987, but is still fondly remembered by baseball fans. And he's hoyd with the idea of entering politics for decades. But only jumped in this fall after Feinstein died. Here he is at a victory party in Palm Desert last night. This is the first game of a double header. So keep the evening of November 5th open as we will celebrate again. So a lot more baseball represents ahead for all of us here in California. And honestly, Garvey might not have made the top two in this primary at all without the help of Adam Schiff. So we more about that. Yeah, so Garvey entered late. He didn't raise a lot of money. He didn't do a ton of campaigning. But Schiff basically poured in $10 million into running ads about Garvey. And they were kind of ostensibly attacked ads. Painting Garvey as a Trump Republican. But for conservative voters, it served as an introduction to Garvey in a huge state where he couldn't afford to run TV ads of his own. Okay, so why would Schiff want to face Garvey this fall? We have a kind of unique primary system here. It's an open primary. So all the candidates run on one ballot in the primary and the top two vote getters move on to the runoff regardless of party. So in an overwhelmingly democratic state, where less than one quarter of registered voters are Republican, Schiff wanted to head off his most formidable Democratic opponent who was Orange County Congresswoman Katie Porter. And it looks like it worked. He will now have a much easier time in the November general election. I'm assuming that this was known that that Schiff was doing this. How did that go over with other Democratic voters? Or, you know, how did that tactic go over with them? It doesn't seem to have really hurt him with his supporters. I think Porter's expressed a lot of anger and I think that he could receive some blowback. But I mean, broadly, this is such a big state. I just, I don't know that a lot of voters were actually paying that close of attention. And it's looking to shape up to a pretty low turnout election generally. So it may not sting him ultimately, even though clearly there are some people who are not happy with the tactic. So let's talk about how this race is going to look. And I understand that Schiff's election like party was almost taken over by people protesting the situation in Gaza. Yeah, listen to this. This is how it sounded there. I want to thank you all. You know, that protest echoes what we've seen elsewhere in the country and it might be a taste of what's ahead. Just for Schiff, but for President Biden who did overwhelmingly winning California on Tuesday night's primary. But let's be clear, given the overwhelmingly Democratic electorate in California, it would be extraordinary if Garvey could really amount a serious challenge this fall. So this isn't seen as a competitive race for Republicans, but there are some tight house races in California. And that could help decide who controls Congress next year. Is there anyone which this matchup could influence those races? You know, it could. We're going to have to wait and see. I know some national Democrats are probably happy that there won't be an expensive Democrat on Democrat race between Schiff and Porter in this blue state that would suck money from elsewhere. But having Garvey up toward the top of the ticket could actually excite some GOP voters or conservatives who maybe aren't as enthusiastic about Trump. So we'll kind of have to see how that plays out. That is KQED's Marisa Lagos. Marisa, thank you. Thank you. If you've been experiencing chaos trying to navigate your health care the last few weeks, you are not alone. People around the country have had trouble filling their prescriptions. Many doctors have not been able to bill insurance providers all because one company was targeted with a cyber attack. Good morning, Jenna. Good morning, Michelle. So this attack happened what two weeks ago and things still aren't back to normal? Yes, it's been over two weeks and things are still messed up. At pharmacies, sources say things are starting to improve, but you know, there's still major issues like patients paying full price for drugs. Meanwhile, doctors are having problems submitting insurance claims and looking at patient medical histories. Yesterday, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that they're stepping in to help provide emergency funding, but it's not totally clear how that will play out yet. So how can this attack on a single company, which frankly many of us have probably never heard of, so profoundly disrupt the American health care system? Yeah, basically a ransomware gang called Black Cat breached Change Healthcare. As a cybersecurity reporter, I hadn't heard of them either, but I sure got a crash chorus and exactly how important they are. Let me break it down and you know, it gets complicated. So bear with me. Change Healthcare is like a digital middleman pharmacies, doctors, clinics, they all use it to check patients' eligibility for services, look up their medical histories, and then build the insurance company for treatment. Now they're owned by Optis, which is a subsidiary of United Health, one of the largest health insurance companies in the country. But basically, Michelle, what's important to know is that this is a big juicy target for hackers. But the payment platform went down, the whole health care system was disrupted. I spoke to Douglas Hoy. He is the CEO of the National Community Pharmacist Association about all this. Listen to how he described it. One of the biggest lessons learned from this situation is that when we put all of our eggs in one basket, when that basket tips over all the eggs crack and there's none left, we're scrambled at that point. I also talked to a senior administration official at the White House. They've been working on this and they said that this is an attack that's a real example of concentrated risk and the dangers of a single point of failure. This is obviously very unnerving, so tell us more about what's being done to fix this. So part of the Health and Human Services announcement was that they wanted to help providers figure out ways to make their systems more resilient. If another company like Change Healthcare gets attacked tomorrow, providers should be able to easily switch to another similar one so that they can keep billion insurance without disruption. It turns out there are companies working on this very thing. But have they been successful? Yeah, actually, I reached out to Zach Cantor. He's the founder of a technology company called Steady. He actually ended our conversation on a positive note. Here's what he said. It's a very solvable problem. There's lots and lots of very capable people working on this, both at Steady and at other companies. And it's like it's different than the power company going out and you don't have a backup power source. In this case, it's just a matter of the company's getting in touch. But even if that problem gets solved tomorrow, it could be something else. The cybersecurity standards that need to improve across the board. Hopefully Michelle, this is a moment the health care industry learns from. You don't never let a good crisis go to waste. NVR cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin. Jenna, thank you.

A few months ago, I was lucky enough to get invited to a screening of Barbie at the British Embassy. This is not the normal way I spend my evenings, but I was, you know, blessed to get invited to this event. I guess a lot of Barbie was filmed in the UK. So they threw this big party for the film. I went with my sister. It was really beautiful. Like everything was pink. They were like these pink Barbie boxes for us to take pictures in. The sushi was pink. The burgers themselves weren't pink, but the buns were pink. And then after that, they put us on this double-decker bus and we went to the movies and we saw Barbie. And I really, really enjoyed it. And not just because I had been buttered up with alcohol and food in sushi. Tonight, Barbie will be competing in multiple categories at America's yearly celebration of all things. Movies, the Oscars. But I gotta be honest, I haven't watched a lot of the nominated films this year. I'm a single mom, so I'm really busy. I got about three jobs. And I really just love like horror and murder on screens, not in real life, but on screen. And that doesn't always show up in the best movies of the year according to the Oscars. So to help make sense of what I should have seen and what I should still see and what it all means, I'm turning to my colleagues Linda Holmes and Aisha Harris from Pop Culture Happy Hour. Aisha, Linda, thank you for joining us today. Thank you. Yes, Aisha, thanks. Hi, not just colleagues, friends. Thank you, thank you so much. So let's start with like, you know, the big picture on the Oscars and really the best pictures. So best picture nominations. The only ones that I've seen are Barbie and I saw poor things for work. But liked it, what are the other ones that both y'all think that I should prioritize seeing? Well, for me, I think killers of the flower moon was probably one of my favorite movies of the year. That's Martin Scorsese's film. An epic really that is about the Osage County Native American murders that occurred in the early 20th century. How do you view it? Bureau, what? What is it? I was sent down from Washington DC to see about these murders. Huh. You see, you what about him? I see he's doing it. It's just really, to me, it's really stunning. It is very hard to watch. It's over three hours long. So I get why you may not have gotten the chance to see it at Yisha, but it's totally worth checking out. And I think to me, I would love to see it win, although I'm not sure it will win. But Linda, I'm sure you have other thoughts as well. Yeah, I do. And look, there are no duds on this best picture list. And there are years when there are duds. And there are no duds this year. But the two that I would highlight, I think, would be past lives, which is a very, very kind of intimate and touching story about a woman who is happily married, but she gets an opportunity to visit with her childhood sweetheart. Here's just his kid in my head for such a long time. And now he is a physical person. It's really intense, but I don't think that that's attraction. I think I just missed him a lot. It's much more complicated than that, but that's sort of the basics. And then the holdovers, which is about a grumpy teacher and a grumpy student and a very kind and generous woman who works at the boarding school where the kid attends. And the three of them wind up stuck together at the school over the holiday break. I had you got stuck with babysitting duty this year. How'd you manage that? Oh, I don't know. I suppose I failed someone who richly deserved it. You're chendum, popular combination around here. It's a plague. And as you would sort of think, they create this little family unit. I think the movie is very charming. All three of those lead performances are really wonderful from Paul Giamatti and Dominic Cessa and Daveine joined Randolph, who is probably going to wind up supporting actors, I would guess. So those are the two that I would highlight. And the thing of it is, we just talked about, I don't want to do math, but maybe about five movies there. And there are 10 overall. That's part of the reason why it can be difficult to see all of the best movie categories, because there are so many of them. Why did the Academy decide to make that change and to expand from five nominees to 10 nominees? I don't know whether this is I should sense also, but my sense is that it's pretty widely accepted that the reason was partly to make sure that well-made blockbusters had a chance to get in to the best picture field. This was around the time that the dark night had come out. It was not nominated for best picture. In the first few years, after they expanded the field, it didn't really go that way. But and what happened instead was that you got more really little films, which is also okay. And then you did get Black Panther. You got Top Gun Maverick. And this year you get Oppenheimer and Barbie, which are both kind of very different big blockbusters. So that's my sense of what it was for, and that this is a year when it kind of worked. There's also, there's a time when blockbusters, or at least movies that did really well at the box office, it didn't necessarily have to be thrillers or action movies. But they often, they were also considered oscarry and overlap. I think of something like Titanic, American Beauty, Lord of the Rings, Brookback Mountain. They were on various levels of success in terms of box office, but they were movies that most people had seen. And so that's less true now in the sort of Marvel fancishification of everything. And I think having 10 nominees now makes it much more likely, like Linda said, that we are going to get a Top Gun Maverick or a Barbie. My Barbie! Hi Ken! Hi Barbie! Hi Barbie! Hi Barbie! Hi Ken! Hi Ken! I feel like Oppenheimer probably would have gotten in anyway, maybe just because of the subject matter. Probably. But it's still Chris Frenowlin, he's known for bigger action movies than some of these other directors in this category as well. And we should, we didn't know at the beginning, but there are two Aisha's in this thing. So you just have to pick up on the social cues of who they're referring to. I'm sure people would have picked up on that, but just in case. You know, I guess when you look at award seasons overall, like how has the growth of social media changed the way we reflect and consume these types of award shows, right? Like, what has the impact been? I think it's going to be really interesting to see because this is the first one that to me is post Twitter. Because although Twitter, as X still exists, it's certainly not what it was. It's not nearly as popular with the people that I used to follow as it was. So this for me is a post Twitter Oscars. And I do think it'll be different. It's hard to think like what would the Will Smith slapping situation have been like if we hadn't had social media. Oh, wow. Wow. Will Smith to smack this **** out of me? Would it have been a smaller deal bigger deal? I don't know. What do you think Aisha? Yeah. I mean, I don't know if Twitter X, whatever is quite dead yet because unlike like Blue Sky, you can't post gifts and stuff. I do think though, like from an Academy perspective, you know, they've resorted to some embarrassing tactics in the past few years to try to appeal to social media. Linda, remember the fan favorite and cheer moment categories that they added in 2022 against everyone's wishes. Basically, they had people like vote online and they chose winners for like fan favorite and cheer moment. I don't really entirely know what cheer moment was supposed to mean. But like whoever's movies hashtag was tweeted the most was the one that won, which just led to like random, rabid online fandoms for like Johnny Depp and Camilla Cabello, like taking over the whole thing. So social media is not really the Oscars forte. But like Linda said, it will be interesting to see with Twitter sort of not being that central water cooler anymore. Will it just be kind of little more muted than it has been in the past few years? Do you think that the Academy wants the super dramatic thing to happen? Maybe not a slap, but just to get people to tune in. Do they need someone falling or someone kissing or something? I think a fall is probably grit like a safe fall. Like a Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence, that was her thing for a while. Jennifer Lawrence tripping up the stairs, I think is fine for them. You guys are just standing up because you feel bad that I fell and that's really embarrassing. But thank you. I don't think that they would want, maybe they would want another thing as dramatic as a slap. I was going to say maybe not the slap, but like something else. Well, I'm moonlight. Blah, blah, blah. Oh, yeah. I don't know if I want that. There's a mistake. Moonlight, you guys won Best Picture. Moonlight, the mix up. Oh my goodness. Yeah. But it was quite a moment. It was quite a moment. It was. People paid attention. Moonlight, Best Picture. When listening to the Sunday story, when we come back, we'll dig deeper into this year's nominees and share a few predictions for tonight's awards.

Hear stories of climate action on Hear and Now Anytime. Welcome back to the Sunday story. I guess we should get into the actual nominees themselves because you guys have seen them as we talked about. Linda, you've written about this, but something that's happened the last few years is international films are getting more love from the Oscars. How is that playing with this year's nominees? Well, yeah, it's been more common in the last few years to see international films. And in this case, I specifically mean films not in English, which is not, you know, the same thing as an international film, but that's kind of what we mean here. Whether it feels like Parasite or Roma. And in this case this year, both anatomy of a fall and zone of interest are nominated for a best picture. Those are both international films, primarily not in English. And of course, you have the international feature category. But also the documentary nominees, the documentary feature nominees are all international films this year. And they're all wonderful, sad, but great. So yeah, it's a good thing to me. And do you think that it's reflective of a US audience that's more open to other films or films with subtitles? I really hope so. And I would love to think that the fact that people now maybe on Netflix or something like that have more access. I think you see more people who are going to like watch a K-Drama at home that has subtitles or a show from France or Israel or Russia or something like that. It's foundationally a good thing for people to be willing to watch things that aren't in English because it is a great, is a very important part of expanding your knowledge and your experience. So I sure hope so. It also seems like a little bit of a spillover from what we were talking about earlier in terms of opening the best picture category up because oftentimes those types of films might only have a shot at getting the best international film prize. And now that's not necessarily the case. And I think something like anatomy of the thought might have been that, you know, one of those films that got stuck in that one category as opposed to multiple categories. Which of the films nominated for best picture surprised you most this year? I would say for me, I think Barbie was a much more thoughtful film than I expected it to be. Maybe not once I knew it was Greg or Greg doing it because she's always a thoughtful director. But when you first hear there's going to be a Barbie movie you don't necessarily expect it to be as thoughtful and emotionally complicated as it turned out to be. You have to be thin but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy but also you have to be thin. You have to have money but you can't ask for money because that's crass. I think I also really liked anatomy of a fall. It's a very unusual courtroom drama that still has some of the appeal of a traditional courtroom drama. So as you can see, an accidental fall is going to be hard to defend, given the height of the window sale. So that's why there's an investigation for more respect. Stop, stop. I did not kill him. That's not defined. I loved that movie. And then I was, you know, as I mentioned the holdover earlier, that was one that kind of snuck up on me and I, and that I loved more than I expected to. Yeah, for me, I think though the movie that surprised me the most was the holdovers, I think Alexander Payne, the director has been very hitter-miss throughout his career. But this film really snuck up on me and it felt like a throwback to the kind of like crowd pleasing adult dramas of the 90s and early arts where you have like these great performances from Paul Giamatti, Devine Joy, Randolph and Dominic Cessah. And it also just strikes a really nice balance between sentimentality and wit. And it just feels like the type of movie that 20 years ago would have made a lot of money at the box office. So I just really enjoyed it and it feels like the kind of film that I might go back and rewatch again at some point. It feels like a good holiday movie that's not quite a holiday movie. Absolutely. Because it's set during the Christmas holiday break. Yeah. You can't really talk about the Oscars without talking about snubs. I've been talking about Barbie being snubbed for a best director and best actress. And people have all sorts of feelings about Barbie. I think that maybe it's hype kind of got it and ate it up a little bit because it was hard for people to take in after that because they expected, I don't know, they expect to send amazing. You know, Schindler's list and they didn't get that. But what do you think are some of the biggest snubs this year? Well I loved Barbie as I said and I would have cheered if Greta Gerrick had been nominated or Margarabi had been nominated, but the movie was not snubbed, right? It made a gazillion dollars. It's nominated for best picture. The movie is doing fine. If I were going to be upset about a lack of nominations in those two categories, I would go back to past lives. Greta Lee who played the lead and Celine Song, who's the director, absolutely should both have been nominated. There's no question about it. And those to me are true or snubs than Greta Gerrick and Margarabi. Yeah, for me, I didn't get to see this until January, but Origin, Ava Javierene's really sweeping drama that's based on Isabel Wilkerson's book Cast. I don't know what happened. I think the way that rollout went out, it just kind of flew way to under the radar and didn't have enough steam for a award season. It's been really kind of shut out from much of the award season, but I want people to see that film and I would have left to see nominated. My other snub that I was very annoyed with was May, December. It did get a screenplay not, but nothing for its three leads, Julianne Moore, Natalie apartment Charles Mountain, and my goodness. That was probably my favorite movie of last year. And I was very sad to see how underrepresented it was amongst the nominees this year. I will say that I don't necessarily have a lot of favorite best pictures because what I like does not get recognized by the Academy is snubbed all the time. They're not going to nominate Fast Furious. They're not nominated. Well, maybe for sound effects or something. But they're not nominating the horror movies. I mean, I did see Parasite. So that one I did have a little bit of a bit of a horror element. I did a little bit. And of course, one of the best, one of my favorites though, Silence of the Lambs. Now that was one of my top five favorite movies of all time. I will always watch it. What are y'all favorites? For me, I have to go with all about Eve or the apartment. They're just some of my all time. I know. Very predictable. But if we're talking more recent, for me, it would be everything everywhere all at once, which one last year. But also, you know, Moonlight and Parasite. Yeah, I love those. Yeah. I think for me, I think for me, if I actually am saying favorite favorite, I would probably go with something that I've seen a million times like the sound of music or something like that. You are talking more recently. That would be, as I mentioned, Moonlight or Parasite, both of which the wins for those two movies were like, it was so invigorating as somebody who loves movies and wants to love the Oscars. Both of those moments were just terrific to feel like that could happen. So you feel like they were kind of the underdogs and they won. Well, they were underdogs and Parasite again is a film not in English. There's not a long history of that being a best picture. Well, it was the first thing. It was the first one I found to explain. Yeah. So listen, it is exciting anytime you feel like an institution as stodgy as the Oscars can grow. And so seeing that kind of growth, it is exciting. You don't want to care about the Oscars, but then you kind of want them to be better. And it's satisfying when that happens. Because I know that you guys always do a whole episode of Pop Culture Happy Hour with predictions. So definitely, everyone should go and check that out. But are there any predictions that you want to share here? Maybe a controversial prediction or one that you would put money on will definitely happen. Like, just give us a little preview. I think that a lot of the categories this year have clear front runners. And I expect most of those front runners to come through. I don't think there are going to be a lot of big surprises. I expect Oppenheimer to win best picture. That's just my expectation, although he'd never bet against Martin Scorsese. I think that a most interesting category to me in terms of I really go back and forth is best actress, particularly between Emma Stone and Lily Gladstone. And I think that's just because Emma Stone has been around a lot in those things. And Lily Gladstone, even though she's an experienced actor, is a newer face to the Oscars. And to that, you know, Martin Scorsese movie audience, because she's in Killer's the Flower Moon. I feel like that one could go either way. I'm betting on Lily Gladstone, but I feel like it could go either way. Yeah, that's the exact same thing that I'm feeling now as well. And look, Emma Stone is really fantastic and for things. I agree. So if she won, I wouldn't be upset. But I do really want to see this for Lily Gladstone. Me too. And yeah, we'll see. Ooh. Nailed biting. Well, we will see. And we'll hold you both to account for your predictions. Oh, thank you. All right. Aisha, Linda, thank you both so much for being here and sharing your thoughts today. It's always great to have you.

The new boss of South Africa's energy provider starts in the country's toughest job. South Korean women defy government efforts to push them towards motherhood. And a Palestinian singer in Iceland gets closer to his Eurovision drink. It's Friday, March 1st. This is Reuters World News, bringing you everything you need to know from the front lines in 10 minutes every weekday. I'm Kim Vinal in London and I'm Carmel Kremens in Dublin. This episode is brought to you by Uipath. Today, 90% of the Fortune 500 are accelerating human achievement simply, with Uipath, the World's Number 1 AI-powered business automation platform, Uipath, the foundation of innovation. Palestinians rush to get their loved ones to hospital after violent scenes in northern Gaza. Israeli forces opened fire on civilians during a chaotic attempt to get aid into the enclave. Local health officials say more than 100 people were killed. The Israeli military says most of the victims were trampled or run over in the rush to secure food. This man said his brother was wounded trying to get bread for his kids. The latest bloodshed adding to the grim milestone of over 30,000 now dead in Gaza, spiraling desperation for those left behind. So instead of playing politics with the issue, why don't we just get together and get it done? President Joe Biden challenging Donald Trump to help him secure the southern border. Biden and Trump made dueling trips to Texas border towns on Thursday, seeking to leverage what's expected to be one of the biggest issues of the 2024 presidential race. Crowds gather at the scene of a massive fire in Bangladesh's capital Ducca. At least 45 people died in the inferno, which started in a biryani restaurant and raced through a six-story building. Iranians are voting in the first election since anti-government protests in 2022. The poll to seem as a key test of support for Iran's clerical routers. Dan Maricone, the new boss of South African energy provider Eskham, has a big job ahead of him. For starters, when's he going to turn the lights back on? Trump is hampered by debt, accusations of corruption, sabotage, and coal theft. And rolling blackouts are crippling South Africa. Joe Bavia is in Johannesburg from Maricone's first day. Joe, this job has been described as the worst in South Africa. Well, it's an extremely high pressure job. The company is in really dire financial straits. It's also suffering from regular technical failures and mechanical breakdowns that lead to nationwide blackouts. And fixing those problems are extremely difficult. It requires a lot of money that the organization doesn't have. It's living bailout to bailout at the moment and the government is right out of patients, basically. So it's really just a massive undertaking for anyone. And the company seen a revolving door of CEOs for the last 15 years, more than it does it. None so far have really managed to fix the thing. One of those predecessors was even poisoned by cyanide. Tell us about that. Well, his predecessor, Andre Derreiter, was really on a mission to stamp out crime and corruption within the organization. So you're talking about criminal gangs that are involved in stealing coal or who have shady agreements for transportation. And yeah, when you start messing with their livelihood, there's a risk that they'll push back. That's one of the theories around what happened to Andre Derreiter. What do S. Combs' woes mean for everyday South Africans? We've had daily rolling blackouts. So these are scheduled blackouts that are designed to ensure that the grid is not overwhelmed. So periods of two hour blocks, usually sometimes four hour blocks. And that affects everyone. It's private residences, it's businesses. And it's also things like hospitals and schools and traffic lights. So things just stop working. My name is Bashar Murad. I'm a Palestinian pop artist from Jerusalem. A Palestinian pop singer from Jerusalem is singing at the Eurovision Song Contest for Iceland. That is Bashar Murad's dream. In 2007, my dad and my mom actually made an effort part of Sabriyan, which later became a non-profit, an effort to try to get Palestine into the Eurovision. He's not representing Palestine, but his dream of being on stage at the finals is closer to reality, thanks to this. Wild West is Bashar Murad's bid for Eurovision. It's a collaboration with members of the Icelandic band, Hattari, who have a connection to Gaza. They raised a banner showing Palestinian flags during the 2019 Eurovision. I contacted my friend Aina from Hattari, and I messaged him and asked him if you have to be Icelandic in order to compete in the Icelandic singing competition. And he quickly checked the rules, and we discovered that you'd not have to be Icelandic. You just have to perform the song in Icelandic in the semifinal. Eurovision attracts millions of TV viewers around the world, but it builds itself as a non-political event and can disqualify those it considers to be in breach of that. The song is about not letting imaginary and physical borders define us or confine us. The war in Gaza weighs heavy as a backdrop this year, with Eurovision organizers so far resisting calls for Israel to be excluded. Although they have been scrutinizing its song, as it might refer to the October 7th attack by Hamas. The final of Iceland's competition is this Sunday. That's when Bashar will find out of this journey continues to Sweden and Malmo, where the Eurovision finals are held in May. South Korea has long had the lowest fertility rate in the world. Billions has been spent by the government trying to get women to have more babies. But the latest figures out this week show the rapid decline in the birth rate is only continuing. Josh Smith is in Seoul. So Josh, why aren't women having kids? A lot of the reasons that we hear from women in particular is the overall burden, and both financially as well as the impact it has on their jobs and careers, and they're basically opportunities to have life outside of having kids. Here in South Korea, there is a lot of women are particularly well educated, but then there's also a major disparity between the work that they do in the home between the women and men, and that's often very cited by women. At the same time, both men and women also cite basically just sheer high costs in South Korea, while the government has tried to give more financial incentives to couples to have children. It remains one of the countries where people spend the most to raise children, for example, a lot of spending on private education, cram schools, things like that, in kind of a hyper competitive educational and work situation. I've been telling you that they're able to find partners, or is it a matter of, you know, there are lots of people are married, but they just don't want to have kids. It's both. So marriage rates have also fallen a lot, and both men and women kind of complaining about the difficulties of finding people who share their values politically, as well as kind of being on the same page when it comes to family and work and sharing the load. I'm sure there are a lot of women around the world, and men too, who are listening, nodding their heads going, well, that's the same here, you know, really identifying. Are there any reasons for this that are really specific to South Korea culturally? I think, as you note, I mean, you know, some of these issues will sound very familiar to people around the world, but in some cases the data does show that some of these challenges are particularly acute in South Korea. For example, the gap between men and women when it comes to the impact that having kids has on their career is really striking and severe in South Korea. Why is the low fertility rates such a concern for the government? It's expected to have widespread impact on everything from obviously things like the country's pension system, and then there's the military, for example, here relies heavily on conscripts. They're having to transition and rethink how they man their large military here that faces off with North Korea to the North, and it's also kind of sparking some thinking about the country's immigration system which has tended to be pretty restrictive.

Lomakers push TikTok's Chinese owners to sell their steak or face a US ban. As ozempic maker Novo Nordisk saws past Tesla after trials of another weight loss drug. And the fight for justice on International Women's Day takes us to an indigenous community in Greenland. It's Friday, March 8th. This is Royce's World News bringing you everything you need to know from the front lines in 10 minutes. Every weekday. I'm Kim Vannell in London. And I'm Christopher Walgesburg in Chicago. Now my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin, quote, do whatever the hell you want. That's a quote. President Biden lashes out at Donald Trump in his state of the Union address. A former president actually said that, bowing down to a Russian leader, I think it's outrageous, it's dangerous, and it's unacceptable. Biden used the televised speech to make his case for a second term, sparring with Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who heckled him over Lakin Riley, a woman allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant. Lakin Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal. That's right. But how many of thousands of people being killed by legal? And under pressure from Democrats over his support for Israel's offensive in Gaza, warning Israel against using aid as a bargaining chip. The leadership of the Israel, I say this, humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be priority. Biden is directing the US military to build a temporary port in Gaza to bolster aid to the enclave. A temporary peer will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting in Gaza every day. The port will accommodate large ships carrying food, water, medical supplies, and temporary shelters. Sweden is now officially a member of NATO, joining its neighbor Finland. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has driven both Scandinavian nations to apply. Voters in Ireland are deciding whether to remove a reference to a woman's life within the home from their constitution. The government is pitching the vote, deliberately being held on International Women's Day as a chance to delete sexist, old-fashioned language about women. But some advocacy groups are opposed to it over concerns about what it will mean for carers. And a reminder, daylight savings time begins in the US this Sunday. Don't forget to check your clocks and wake up early. The stock price for Wigovi Drug Maker Novo Nordisk has hit new record highs, surpassing Tesla in its market valuation. The latest jump in the Danish companies shares comes after better than expected results from trials of a new experimental weight loss treatment called Amacritin, even though its years before patients will be able to use it. Joe Mason in London is our European company's editor. Joe, what makes this drug such a big deal? Early trials showed that patients lost 13% of their weight after 12 weeks of taking this pill. Now that is significant because it's more than double actually the amount of weight lost by volunteers who were part of the Wigovi trial. Ultimately, over the whole course of the Wigovi trial, patients lost 15%, but in those first 12 weeks they lost 6%. So that's why the market is getting very excited. So this is potentially a big advancement. Is anyone else working on this type of treatment? Yes, in fact, a fellow Danish company called Zeeland Farmer. Their shares rose because they have a similar treatment that they are studying. They're much earlier on in the process than Novo Nordisk. It's also notable that the US Drug Maker Eli Lilly's shares were down on the news. They have a rival weight loss drug. So the market is interpreting the comments from Novo today as a sign that they really could widen the gap with Lilly where there is a competition heating up. More than 100 in-new at women from Greenland, a suing former colonial ruler, Denmark, for forcing them to have IUDs or coils put in without their consent or knowledge in the 1960s. Some 4,500 devices were fitted in women and girls as young as 13. They sought compensation last year, but the state refused to pay out. Reporter Jacob Gronhold Peterson is in Copenhagen. Jacob, what are these in-new at women telling you? They are telling never-stating and heartbreaking stories. Most of these women are in their 70s and 80s now. They recall that stories like when they went to school, they were suddenly called into the basement to see a doctor who had come all the way from Denmark. They describe how they felt pressured into doing this. The pain they went through, one woman tells it felt like she was being stabbed with knives. Then they tell the traumas they've gone through by not being able to carry children later in their lives because of the physical impact these fittings had on their bodies. The group failed to get compensation last year because the government wants to wait for an independent investigation. So why they're taking the Danish government to court now? No one even talked about this case until 2017 when one of the women made a post on Facebook about what she had gone through and she asked if there were. Others with similar experiences, she got a massive response and hundreds of women joined the group. But many of these women are old during their 70s and 80s and basically they want compensation sooner rather than later. So they went ahead and took the Danish state to court. Claiming that their human rights have been violated. A new effort to reign in TikTok is gaining steam in Congress, a House committee approving legislation that gives the Chinese owned bite dance less than six months to divest from the app or face a US ban. The bill still needs to pass the full house and the Senate is looking at a similar measure. We caught our reporter David Sheppardson outside the Capitol building. David, how would this work? Aren't opponents of the bill saying it's a violation of free speech? So we backed up to August 2020 when then President Trump issued an executive order that basically did the exact same thing. But the courts ultimately struck down that executive order and the ban on the basis of free speech. So this bill seeks to go around those free speech issues by focusing this on national security grounds. Are you going to not banning TikTok? They're just giving the owners a ultimatum cell or you'd face a ban. Do we have any evidence that China is using the app to spy on Americans? Back in 2020, that was one of the big questions. What is the evidence? Are there intelligence intercepts? Is the Chinese government using the data harvested from 170 million US users and tens of millions of American teenagers? There's no evidence of that. But the possibility is there that TikTok data could be sent to the Chinese government. TikTok has been adamant for years, including when their CEOs testified before the hill. They would not and have not ever shared data of American users for the Chinese government. The Biden campaign is now on TikTok. Does that create a weird disconnect? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, they're they're threading a pretty tough needle here. They're saying, hey, we're going to reach out to young users by using TikTok. And in a hand, the White House says, this is a national security threat. We want to address it. So no, I think their argument is, hey, we don't support a ban. We support a sale. And finally, the Oscars are this weekend. Tomorrow, we'll devote an entire episode to the Pomp and Circumstance and go behind the scenes with our entertainment reporters. But if you're one of the lucky few to be nominated, you'll have this to look forward to. This is an ultra luxury line. It sells for about $515. The goodie bag. Lash Farrie is founder of an LA-based marketing company and has put together this Oscars swag bag for 22 years. We do this independently of the academy, which means I get to decide who gets it and it's only the top acting and directing nominees. That's 25 people this year. The swag bag includes nearly 60 items worth over $170,000. Ranging from the most expensive. The $50,000 trip to Shale Zermatt Peak in the Swiss Alps. Two Arubix Coupe. Companies pay a fee for their spot in the bag, but the exposure to a list of celebrities can be priceless. They're so famous and their names have such value in such cashier and that's exactly what they can bring to these products. We'll be back on Monday with our daily headline show.

Wednesday, March 6th, 2024, I'm Jessica Brosenthal. Super Tuesday is in the books near clean sweeps for President Biden and former President Trump as the likely general election matchup between the two moves closer to reality. So this is a sea of Trump red across the political map from California to Texas to Virginia. I'm Dave Anthony. The father of a school shooter is on trial this weekend Michigan. The boys' mothers already been convicted for not doing enough to prevent their son from going on that killing spree. Did they act appropriately? I don't think they did. I think that they were negligent as parents and what they did. But I'm still quite divided about using the criminal code for this purpose. And I'm Tommy Laren. Super Tuesday, saw former President Trump winning nearly every contest, including the delegate rich states of California and Texas. He did not win Vermont, which went for former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley giving her some delegates. President Biden won nearly all of his contests as well, except for American Samoa. Nikki Haley had no events on her calendar, no election night speech at a party headquarters. We asked the campaign, what are their expectations heading into this super Tuesday? They told us to be competitive. We asked, well, what does competitive mean? They said it's not for the media to decide that, but they point out that Nikki Haley has been getting chunks of voters in these early states. They feel there is an appetite for a non-Trump vote out there. This is a pro-American movement. What her next steps were though weren't immediately clear on election night. Former President Trump spoke from his estate Marlago in Palm Beach, Florida. They call it super Tuesday for a reason. This is a big one. He gave a tone down at times even somber speech. We had the safest border of the best numbers we've ever had, and now we have the worst numbers probably. Probably in the history of the world, it's sad to see what's happening to our cities. Our cities are being overrun with migrant crime. But his words focused on President Biden, the state of the country. He did not mention Nikki Haley. It's been all but over on the Republican side. Certainly since South Carolina when Nikki Haley wasn't unable to really come close to winning her home state. And when you look at the super Tuesday results with the exception of Vermont, which is the one state that Haley has in her quarter. But the rest of the map is overwhelmingly Trump territory from Alabama. Trump won by a 70 point or so margin, North Carolina, 50 point margin, even Virginia, which looked like it could be a state where Haley was at least competitive. She loses by about 30 points. So this is a sea of Trump red across the political map from California to Texas to Virginia for Mont the one blip of Haley, Haley Pink on the political primary map. But boy, this is a route for Donald Trump and assign that he, you know, as a hold, a strong hold over the Republican party. And frankly, a lot of these Haley voters as I think is underscored by the Vermont result, the Washington DC result over the weekend. A lot of the Haley supporters are increasingly Democrats or, you know, liberal leaning independents that have participated as crossover voters in these Republican primaries. All right. You heard the speech with me. And when I'm a president of Trump sounded serious, even a little bit maybe somber. He used the word sad a couple of times to describe like the state of the country, just as someone who listens to a lot of political speeches, including campaign ones. What was your impression of his tone? It was a general election speech. I mean, he didn't mention Nikki Haley one time in the entire speech. He barely even mentioned super Tuesday. He kind of began with it and ended with it. But the rest of the speech was kind of a condensed version of a lot of the stump speech that he gives, maybe a little bit less raw raw to your point, a little bit more circumspecced as he talked about immigration, as he talked about the economy. And he is setting up, I think, what his general election message is going to be, right? He talked about, you know, the job that his administration did, how, you know, what the economy looked like, what the world looked like. I think trying to remind voters, maybe, you know, to think back about those times. And you're going to see that from President Biden as well, right? He is going to talk about the chaos, the uncertainty, the demagoguery, all of that that he has talked about, the importance of democratic institutions over the four years of the Trump administration. So listen, these are two campaigns that have very different visions of how the four years of the Trump presidency went. And you're going to see that now play out. Boy, for a long time, right? This is going to be one of the longest general elections we've had in a while. It is so interesting because Trump's campaign has already been a lot of, remember what it was like four years ago. It's not a typical campaign. Josh, what did you think of the tone and the vibe around how Trump sounded, how he came across? Yeah, look, I mean, this was not New Hampshire. This was not him going after Nikki Haley, who's already vanquished. He needs to focus on the general election. He's doing well, if you believe, all the latest polls in the general election against President Biden. I thought his focus on border security and immigration is a smart political move. You're going to be hearing a lot more of that given that it's a top issue for voters, heading into the general election. And look, every time you say Trump is more disciplined, he always regresses and says something that is just outrageous and politically unwise. And we go back and forth for indefinitely. But no, this was kind of speech that is looking ahead and focusing on his opponent for the general election. And Jared, the White House response was tonight's results leave the American people with a clear choice. Are we going to move, keep moving forward or will we allow Donald Trump to drag us backwards into chaos, division and darkness that defined his terminopolis four years ago I ran because of the existential threat Trump posed to the America we all believe in. Is this how the president goes after Trump's quote unquote jugular as Axios reported? He was going to do heading into Super Tuesday. It's how he has been going after his predecessor since the very beginning. The first political event that President Biden did earlier this year was outside of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, right? And that was by design. That was a speech I was there that was entirely about the threat to democracy. How this is an election about bigger issues than just a policy disputes, right? That even if you don't like everything from a policy standpoint that President Biden is doing, you need to vote. Over a much bigger issue, right? Democracy as we know it, these democratic institutions. That has been a constant theme of President Biden. Even before the campaign had started in earnest, remember he gave that speech in Philadelphia that kind of hit on many of the same themes. Now, a lot of people for critical of that speech, it was a presidential address, it was not a campaign speech, but the themes are the same. And I think you're going to hear from President Biden a lot on that. And I think you're also going to see the President talk about the economy and you have seen him lean into immigration and border enforcement. I expect Thursday night, we probably see the President talk about the role in his view that former President Trump played in derailing that bipartisan immigration agreement that was emerging in the Senate and kind of laying some of that blame on Republican shoulders as well. But the broader theme of democratic institutions and this existential threat that President Trump is to American democracy is not a new sentiment from President Biden, but it is one that I think Democrats think is a winning strategy and one that I think you're going to see the President lean into a lot heavier over the next several months. All right, Jared, quickly, is this going to be dueling discussions about the border from Republicans, abortion from Democrats, with the economy sort of sprinkled throughout the rest of the year, barring anything else happening in eight months, which is a really long time. No, I think both parties are going to try and win voters on those issues, right? I think you are already starting to see Republicans try and message the abortion issue. Certainly they know what role that played in the 2022 midterms. You're hearing them kind of talk about federal legislation that they argue is in line with where a majority of Americans are anyway on the abortion issue. On the border, you are seeing President Biden take a much different tact, right? He visited the border. He talked about this emerging deal that would have really toughened existing asylum laws and gone further than a lot of Democrats even were comfortable with, but he sees that this is an issue and explaining Republicans and particularly Donald Trump for blowing that up. And so I think that you are starting to see some of the seeds from both Republicans and Democrats on how they can maybe be aggressive, play a little bit of offense on these two issues that they have really had to be back on their heels for for the better part of a couple of election cycles now. Okay. And finally, one more quickly for you, Josh. These uncommitted voters, double digits out of Minnesota, North Carolina, Massachusetts, does President Biden have an issue on his hands that he needs to address or are these voters who, you know, they're not going to go for Donald Trump, so he's not going to worry about them. Yeah, look, you can look at where these votes are coming from. They're from the most left wing elements of those states, Minneapolis, St. Paul and Minnesota, Durham, Chapel Hill and North Carolina. Yeah, I mean, look, I don't think Biden has a huge problem with, you know, a lot of these are anti-Israel votes, by the way, these are, you know, communities that are left wing, fulfilled with left wing activists similar to what we saw in Dearborn and Michigan and some of the college towns in Michigan. But it's a problem when you look at the bigger picture, Biden has a big problem with his progressive base. He is getting weak support from younger voters that should be overwhelmingly supporting a Democrat against Donald Trump. Weak support among African-American voters, weak support among a lot of the progressives for a Democrat. So that is a big challenge. Biden's facing challenges on both sides of his coalition. He's got progressives in the base that are very lukewarm towards him, but he also is losing swing voters and moderates and then the persuadable voters that backed him over Trump in 2020. So it's a no win situation for Biden. You see some pockets of discontent among left wing precincts, but he also, you know, if he panned her to the left, he would also lose more votes from the middle than he also is struggling with. I was also going to say on those points, Josh, that if you look at the Republican side of that coin, and certainly it has been a dominant performance by former President Trump, but even in states like North Carolina, 23% or so go to Nikki Haley. There are states where she is up in that sort of 24, 25% range. Are those votes that are winnable for former President Trump? Well, look, a lot of these, it's striking when you look at Nikki Haley's strongest areas, that there are parts of the country like Arlington, Virginia, heavily democratic suburb of Washington, DC. You've got Burlington, Vermont, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some of these are open primary and not all of them, but a lot of these states have open primaries that we just talked. I'm not sure if these voters are going to vote Republican at all, no matter who the Nikki Haley was a nominee, they might not even vote for her against Joe Biden, because a lot of Democrats have kind of voted in the Republican primary to cast a ballot against Donald Trump. That may be about, you know, in Virginia, I think it's about 10% of the electorate with Democrats, maybe a little less than some of the other states that have open primaries. So I don't even know if we're seeing Republican voters, even like anti-Trump Republican voters. Some of these are anti-Trump Democrats that voted in these primaries, and that's why some of the bluest parts of the country are showing up for Haley, but you know, everywhere else, it's, you know, certainly been a much stronger Trump performance. Thanks, Jess. Thanks, Jess. Hi, everybody. It's Brian Kilmeade. I want you to join me weekdays at 9 AM East as we break down the biggest stories of the day with some of the biggest newsmakers. And of course, what do you think? Listen live or get the podcast now at Brian KilmeadeShow.com. Coming up. It's the second trial in a first of its kind case. Having a school shooter's parents criminally responsible for their son's killing spree. I am a really bad person. I have done terrible things that no one should ever do. That was Ethan Crumbly back in December before he was sentenced to life without parole, promising to become a better person in prison. He pleaded guilty to murdering four classmates at Oxford High School in Michigan, November 30th, 2021, and injuring seven other people. Then you wanted a school or parents. They did not know and I did not tell them what I planned to do so they're not at fault what I've done. But just because Ethan excused his parents, prosecutors have not. Jennifer Crumbly was the first to go on trial on four charges of involuntary manslaughter, accused of ignoring her son's mental illness, not getting the 15-year-old the help he needed and asked for. Of course I looked back after this all happened and I've asked myself if I will do anything differently and I wouldn't have. Wait for you to hear what she said next in her testimony. We'll play it later. Jennifer Crumbly was convicted a month ago and faces up to 15 years in prison at Setons in April. This week Ethan's father James Crumbly is on trial on similar charges. One of the most troubling case I think was Jennifer Crumbly's case because she was largely convicted of being a bad mother. There were indications that her son was disturbed and that is certainly something that has generated a great deal of condemnation about how they responded to it. The father, the trial is likely to be different in one major respect. James Crumbly is accused of purchasing the weapon that was used in this shooting and that is more of a traditional type of action for this type of charge. He's being accused of effectively facilitating even if it's negligent or reckless the shooting itself. Now, supposedly that gun, Ethan really wanted it and his father said, okay, and they went on a black Friday shopping trip and got the gun. And James Crumbly insists that he had hidden it away and put the ammunition in a different place. The issue becomes the storage of this firearm, correct? What's a notable distinction from the earlier trial is that he is not accused of receiving worrisome texts from his son. Those messages went to the boy's mother. So this is going to focus almost entirely upon the fact that he purchased this gun really for his son and then failed to properly secure it. The question is whether he can be viewed as committing a criminal act for not going beyond what's required under state law or taking insufficient efforts, even if he did try to secure the weapon. When you though look at this case, he does face similar involuntary manslaughter charges. The parenting issue is going to be brought up again. He is mentioned, for instance, Ethan Crumbly, there is a journal entry that he wrote that he's going to cause the biggest school shooting in Michigan's history. I will kill everyone I see. I have fully mentally lost it after years of fighting my dark side. My parents won't listen to me about help or a therapist. I have zero help. He doesn't say his mother. He says parents. Yes. There is also indications that he was obviously aware of his son's problems. There was one communication from him asking whether his son had been given Xanax one night to avoid a meltdown. It was clearly aware that this was a troubled kid. The question for many of us in looking at these two trials is where to draw this line. Unfortunately, there are millions of families who are dealing with loved ones with mental illness that is particularly prevalent today. It's certainly increased among the very young. Rriminalizing these tragedies will not necessarily help in that. These parents often find that they have a system that doesn't offer much support. They can be very difficult to get children into supervised care or overnight treatment. There are very few beds available in many states. Many families like this one are not well off. They have limited funds. Where do you draw the line here? No one is questioning whether these parents were aware of their child's mental problems. It comes down to what is required criminally of parents. What can they be criminally held liable for not doing? The people who are victimized by this crime, they see that on the day of the school shooting, November 30, in 2021, the crumblies are in the school the morning of. They are talking to officials, the guidance people and people in the school, and they're shown disturbing drawings and disturbing writings that their son had. In the end, they leave. Ethan stays in school. No one checks the backpack, the guns inside, and he goes on the shooting spree. If you are victimized by this crime, you'll want the parents to be held accountable, wouldn't you? Oh, I'm sure I would. If my child was lost in this, I would want retribution. Would you want the school held accountable? I mean, they left them there. Nobody checked the backpack. Well, the question is not how one would feel as a parent, but how we handle not just this but future cases. There's no indication that the parents knew that their son was going to commit this type of act. What they knew is that they had a very unstable son that he had made threats to others. Did they act appropriately? I don't think they did. I think that they were negligent as parents and what they did. But I'm still quite divided about using the criminal code for this purpose. This is not excusing these two parents. I don't think that they did what they could have done. But I think it's very easy to turn to the criminal code and say, well, because the shooting occurred, you should also be held responsible in terms of a criminal complaint. Now keep in mind, there's also civil liability that can come. Parents can sue these parents for their role in failing to take action. I would be more comfortable with civil liability than I would criminal liability. But just suing them doesn't, for some people, they think, no, there has to be more than that. Obviously, people believe that the prosecutors believe that. Yeah, I can understand that. And when I first read the account of what these parents done, I was very upset like many parents. But I have to be honest. I think that despite the many times I've looked at these complaints and looked at what happened in the trial, I still don't know how the prosecutors are delineating the line between bad parenting and criminal conduct. And that's a very dangerous thing for parents with millions of families facing these traumatic situations. Because this is a precedent setting situation, correct? It certainly is. So let's go to this trial in another way. Once things get underway, there is a road map. Obviously, the prosecution succeeded in Jennifer Crembley's case. Defense attorneys also have the same road map. They see how her side lost. They see how prosecutors won. Who benefits in trial number two from that road map or is it equal? I think the prosecutors benefit more only in this sense. I think that the first trial was the more difficult trial to make for prosecutors. This one has an actual act that facilitated the shooting. The gun, right? Absolutely. So this has a more traditional feel. It'll be much more difficult for the defense. The fact that the defense couldn't stick the landing on the first trial means that they're going to have an even harder time here. Now back to Jennifer Crembley on the witness stand at her trial. If you could change what happened, would you? Oh, absolutely. I wish she would have killed us instead. Now some have said she came across as cold in her testimony and in how she acted after the school's shooting. James Crembley, Ethan's dad, he said it would have been much more emotional in the aftermath, crying in the back of a police cruiser sobbing during an interview at the station. So will he take the stand at his trial? Should he? Do you think that in a case like this, you have to as a defense counsel resist the temptation to play it safe? Most defense counsel are heavily inclined to keeping their client off the stand. It minimizes the risk of serious injury being done through testimony. But that minimization of risk helps the attorney sometimes more than the client. You can't be blamed for something that didn't happen. In a case like this, I would very likely put my client on the stand. I think that Jury needs to hear from him because he did take this action. He did secure the weapon. They need to know why. And he needs to speak directly at them, to look at them and speak to them as a father who found himself in a very difficult position. As someone that you might not agree with, but you can understand why he was trying to develop these connections with his son that may not succeed. But in my view, it may hold the only hope that he has. In the end, what is the best ground for appeal? She's already been convicted. Maybe he will be. What's the best grounds for appeal? I think that frankly, he has fewer grounds to appeal than his wife because of the action that he took. But in some ways, the appeals will be similar. The degree into which you're criminalizing bad parenting. He will focus on the fact that the prosecutors are assigning a certain recklessness or negligence to how he secured the guns, but that he did so in compliance with state law. The question is, can you be required to do even more? The answer to that is probably yes. Even if the state law says you have to do A, B, and C, many jurors will feel that if you've got a troubled child in the house, you probably should do EF and G. You need to go beyond that given what you're looking at. You can't just do the bare minimum. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. What's on your mind? DEI or diversity, equity and inclusion guidelines have been a woke tumor on businesses and culture. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had enough and put a stop to it in his state. At the start of the year, the Florida Board of Governors passed a regulation to limit public funding of DEI programs, and now those chickens are coming home to roost. Last week, the University of Florida eliminated all employees holding DEI-specific positions. Those employees reported 13 full-time in DEI positions and 15 involved administrative appointments were cut and encouraged to apply elsewhere in the institution. Governor DeSantis celebrated this necessary step saying, Florida is where DEI goes to die. Governor DeSantis has once again proved that the things that other Republican leaders simply just talk about, he does, and he does, was stunning accuracy. He is the future of the GOP. Well, that is, if we're smart at least.

UN investigators in Iraq are in a race against time. Trump scrambles for cash as Biden moves Michigan auto workers with relaxed EV rules. And the World Happiness Survey puts the Nordics at the top again. It's Wednesday, March 20th. This is Royce's World News, bringing you everything you need to know from the front lines in 10 minutes, every weekday. I'm Kim Vannell in London. Britain's Royal family is at the centre of another doctored picture controversy. Kensington Palace released the photo last April to mark what would have been the Queen's 97th birthday. It showed the former monarch surrounded by some of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren and had been taken by Kate. But Royce's editors discovered it had been digitally altered in eight places. Suzanne Plunkett is Royce's chief photographer for the UK. Suzanne, why did Royce not pick this up at the time? We have certain sources that we trust, like Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace. These are sources that we receive the pictures and we'll put them out. Then we have a visual verification team for sources that we might not trust or new sources. So we would have missed it the picture in the first time because we trusted Kensington Palace. And we did just yesterday had a meeting with the King's press secretary and we spoke to him about going forward how we can how they'll distribute their pictures. So they will be sending us the original file along with a picture and they will let us know anything that they've done to change the photo. How do you look for digital alterations? Is there an AI program that does that or does somebody physically sit down and get a magnifying glass? We expand the picture to 100% resolution so that we can see every single pixel and it's whenever pixels are moved around. It has Royce's photographers. We talk about selecting the picture, cropping the picture, making minimal adjustments, but we would never move pixels around and that's what we're looking for. Netanyahu told lawmakers he had informed Biden that a ground invasion into Ruffa was crucial to eradicating Hamas. Ruffa is the last refuge for more than a million displaced people. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to the Middle East today for a sixth visit since Israel's war against Hamas began in October. Last year, every major global climate record was broken and 2024 could be worse. That's the message from the World Meteorological Organization, which says it has particular concern about ocean heat and shrinking sea ice. A law allowing Texas to arrest people suspected of crossing the US border illegally has been blocked just hours after the Supreme Court cleared the way for it to come into effect. A late-night ruling from the New Orleans-based fifth US Circuit Court of Appeals halted the enforcement of the law ahead of oral arguments on the issue scheduled for today. Markets are on edge waiting for the Federal Reserve to conclude its latest policy meeting today. No change in rates is expected, but investors are watching to see where the policy makers will trim the number of anticipated rate cuts this year to two 25 basis point cuts, from the three projected in December. There's only six months left on the clock before a UN mission investigating alleged Islamic state war crimes is forced to shut down. Iraq's decision to end UNITAD, the UN investigative team to promote accountability for crimes committed by Dyesh, throws into question what's next in the quest for justice. Justice for victims like these Yazidi mourners whose family members were killed by Islamic state, their bodies exhumed from mass graves by UNITAD. Teemor Azari is in Iraq. Teemor, how did we get to this point? A lot of the issues between this mission and Iraq were sort of baked in from the beginning. It was in the awkward position of gathering all of this evidence in Iraq and using it in trials abroad, but it couldn't actually use it within the country. That led to a lot of frustration among the Iraqi side who felt basically that they had these foreign investigators in their country going around gathering witness testimony, but then they weren't actually benefiting from it here. Where does this move leave the outstanding cases and the victims who are still seeking justice? He spoke to the head of the mission and he was very clear that by September they will not finish all of their investigative lines and they have contributed to convictions abroad, including the first ever conviction of a Iraqi ISIS fighter or genocide in Germany in 2021. And so a lot of people fear that those processes will basically stop and that will affect the ability to hold ISIS criminals accountable across the world. On a practical level, what happens next? What happens to the evidence? What the head of the mission said he wants to avoid is that this evidence basically ends up in a dead archive in a UN basement. Iraq wants all of that evidence to be handed over, but because of the concerns about some of the due process issues, death penalty and also simple things like capacity and systems that the Iraqi state does not have, that seems unlikely. So we're really in a position where those negotiations are ongoing and it's a bit of a race against time before the mandate of UNITAD ends in September. Donald Trump's failure to secure a bond for the $454 million he owes in a New York civil fraud case has become a central issue in the presidential race. Trump who was found liable for inflating his property values to do blenders and insurers wrote on his social media platform that he may be forced to mortgage or sell part of his real estate holdings at via sale prices to secure a bond. Greg Ramelli-Otis, our US corporate finance editor, has been digging through Trump's court filing this week asking an appeal score to delay the judgment. Well the filing doesn't address is why Trump is not using the substantial equity as he calls it in his properties to raise the cash needed for the bond. So we don't know exactly how much leverage, how much dead Trump has on his properties, but if he doesn't have much, he could go to a bank or private equity firm and borrow against those assets to raise cash that then can be used with an insurance firm to post a bond. So there's a lot of financial questions around this narrative that his lawyers have created in the filing which of course the aim is to convince a judge to reduce the size of the bond required. The Biden administration is easing up on its aggressive push for higher fuel efficiency and a fast transition to electric vehicles. The decision is a win for Detroit and for Michigan, a key battleground for Biden as he seeks a second term. Global automotive correspondent Joe White is in Detroit. Joe, why are they softening these rules? Joe White-Otis, the Biden administration, has put out proposed rules for automotive tailpipe emissions and some related rules that affected how much credit automakers get for selling electric vehicles. If you put those all together, those rules were going to push the US automakers to increase the share of electric vehicles to 67 percent, basically two-thirds of the market by 2032. The automakers and more importantly, the United Auto Workers, the Union that represents workers at the Detroit 3 said those were just too aggressive, unrealistic and not in step with the market. And in the year that has passed, the automakers have basically successfully argued that their businesses would be at risk if they were forced to ramp up EV sales that quickly. It's helped them that EV demand has slowed down in the United States. What's the political angle here for Biden? Michigan is a must win for Joe Biden. It's also a must win for his Republican rival Donald Trump. Michigan is home to tens of thousands of automakers who built combustion, oil burning, gasoline burning trucks and SUVs. Rightly or wrongly, many of these voters believe that electric vehicles are threat to their jobs and their livelihoods. So the Biden administration is very much caught between two important constituencies. One, it's a very large constituency of people who believe that shifting to electric vehicles is essential to containing the damage from climate change. The other constituency are those automakers and voters in Michigan and President Biden needs every single one of their votes, basically, in order to win. So it's very much an election year calculation by the Biden administration. The sound of some of the happiest people on the planet.

Your local auto dealers parking lot could look very different in a few years. A new federal rule makes it likely that that lot will have a lot more electric and hybrid vehicles. By 2032, the government expects two thirds of new cars, trucks and SUVs to have a plug. Here's EPA administrator Michael Regan. I'm pleased to announce the strongest vehicle pollution technology standard ever finalized in United States history. Good morning. Good morning, Steve. I love that job title. By the way, car and energy you're the car respondent is what I think you are. Okay. Anyway, anyway, how do these rules work? Well, they're setting average limits on tailpipe emissions. That includes both greenhouse gases and the stuff in exhaust that's bad for human health, starting in model year 2027. This is not a ban on gas cars. It's not even a mandate that companies have to make electric cars. What it does is it sets this standard that you can meet however you like, so strict for these tailpipe emissions that realistically companies are going to have to make a lot of battery powered cars or at least plug in electric cars, which also can run on battery power to meet these rules. I got you. So this has been one of the concepts of climate efforts for a while. Set a standard, leave it to companies, leave it to industry to figure out how to meet them, but it seems to mean electric cars. So what does this mean for those of us who might be looking for a new car in a few years? Yeah. So in a few years, three years, not much of a difference. In a few years, eight years, a big difference, a lot more electric vehicles than there would be otherwise. And that timeline, the EPA had initially proposed rules that kicked in a lot faster. And auto workers and the auto workers union and automakers lobbied really hard for a slower start to give more time for things like charging infrastructure. And they got what they asked for, so it kicks in slower. It's interesting that the union was against to quick a change here. Obviously, big supporters of President Biden. So how does the auto industry itself feel about these final rules now that they've been changed? Yeah, pretty good. I hear the word challenging a lot, but there's a positive tone. It's important that despite some negative headlines about EVs lately, the auto industry is really adamant that electric vehicles are the future. And in that context, having regulations around how fast that transition happens can be helpful. It puts everyone on the same timeline and gives some certainty around investments. You know, who's not happy about these rules is the oil industry and the biofuels industry for that matter. Expect some lawsuits challenging them in the future. Oh, so a little bit less certainty depending on how the lawsuits go. I'm thinking about then the effects of this. This is, you're saying this is a less radical timeline that the administration initially wanted, but they've adopted the timeline that they can given the politics, given the economics. How good will it be for the environment? These are still historic standards. Environmental groups say they're very significant. EVs are much cleaner than gas cars, even counting the footprint of batteries and charging. So very significant for the climate. This also helps human health and side note saves money on fuel. That's if they stick, like you said, Steve. And that is part of the reason why the administration bent over backwards for the car industry's interests here. The rules are more durable. They're harder to overturn by lawsuit or by future administration. If the industry that's actually being regulated will stick out there next to support them. And Piers Camila Domenoski, thanks so much. Thank you. Alabama is the latest state to prohibit diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in schools, public colleges and state agencies. Governor Kay Ivey has signed a bill that embraces a national conservative theme. The governor said she wants to stop, quote, bad actors on campuses from pushing a, quote, liberal political movement. Good morning. Good morning. What exactly does this law do? So this law mirrors other anti-dei bills we've seen in other Republican legislatures. The sponsor of the bill said it's designed to protect students from indoctrination in the classroom. This law prohibits public schools, universities and government agencies from maintaining a DEI office or funding any DEI programs. It also requires students use bathrooms that correlate with the sex on their birth certificate. And another big thing in the bill is it stops any program that teaches what the law calls a divisive concept. Any teacher who knowingly violates this act can be fired. I'm just dwelling on that phrase divisive concept. What does that mean exactly when you're trying to ban it? That's the big question. You know, what is a divisive concept? During a debate on the House floor, Democrats actually question the language. They tried to get the sponsor Senator Barfoot to give a clearer definition. But the best response they got was that it's talking about race, or gender, or nationality, or religion in any way that makes a student feel superior or inferior. Ah, which catches another national conservative theme, the idea that talking in a certain way about DEI makes white people feel bad or may make some white people feel bad. So this is the kind of thing they say they want to prohibit and teachers can be punished if they're saying too much on this topic. What are you hearing from students about this? So I spoke with Miguel Luna just after the bill passed. He's a sophomore at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He was involved in a protest against this bill and he said students are disappointed by the outcome. I asked him if there have been any changes yet, were students afraid or have any clubs or organizations paused. And he says actually it's only made diversity efforts stronger. But Luna was really concerned about losing access to some of the things that make school enjoyable. He's a part of a networking organization for Latino students. And their advisor might lose her job because she works out of the school's DEI office. But he says he hopes this law will galvanize students. If anything needs to happen in the future, it's people need to start voting and paying attention to state politics. I've also talked to some students who attended a protest against the bill at the Capitol Montgomery, along with Luna earlier this month. Isabella Campos was one of the organizers. We as students are able to stand up for ourselves and get external support because regardless of if we're not going to receive funding from the state, we're not going to disappear and we're not going to be silenced. It's interesting that they're arguing that the efforts now need to come from themselves rather than from some formal state initiative. But whatever their views, they don't seem to have persuaded the legislature. No, not quite. So for Republicans, they set this bill was created to protect students. They don't want them to have what they call a quote, sense of guilt. When Governor K.I.B. signed into law, she said it supports academic freedom, embraces diversity and treats people fairly. But however, at the Capitol protest, students waited outside of the Republican caucus meeting, hoping to talk to them and Luna says legislators went out the back door and would not speak to them. Kelsey Shelton of WBHM in Birmingham. Thanks so much. Thank you for having me. The company that calls itself the front page of the internet is becoming a publicly traded stock. Reddit premieres on the New York Stock Exchange today. It's ticker symbol RDDT. Some of its most active users are not so thrilled and say they might try to disrupt the stock offering. The PR Tech Corp. Bobby Allen is here to explain Bobby. Good morning. Good morning. I guess we should ask first why Reddit would try to become a public company. Well, it's about two things, Steve, raising money and becoming profitable in the companies. Nearly two decade history. It has been very bad at precisely these two things. Now back in 2005, Reddit was founded by Steve Huffman and Alexis O'Hanian. They were two college roommates at the University of Virginia. This was barely a year after Mark Zuckerberg founded a little social network known as Facebook from a Harvard dorm. This was, of course, the era of dudes starting social media sites from college dorms, right? But Reddit was a collection of freewheeling, anything goes, message boards where people posted under pseudonyms about everything from sports to politics to internet memes. Jump ahead to today. Reddit has 73 million users. But despite all of these people posting on Reddit, it's never been able to turn a profit. Why have they not been able to profit off of 73 million users? They've had scandals over toxic content. They've had leadership crises. The site has not exactly been known for civil discourse. It's been chaotic. Not exactly something advertisers want to place ads against. But it really has changed in recent years. It's become more tame and rule bound than it used to be. And it makes hundreds of millions of dollars now in advertising. It's really tried to make even more money. Those efforts have run into protests from regular Reddit users. They prefer a scrappy version of the site that doesn't care about making money. Last year, Reddit decided to start charging third party developers for access to its backend data. We've been subsidizing other businesses for free for a long time. We're stopping that. That's not a negotiable point. We are simply in an unsustainable position. And so we need to get into a sustainable situation. Right. And that sparked a huge backlash among redditors. There was a mass protest that made thousands of communities known as subreddits, go dark. How can they do anything about it? Well, let's go back to 2021. There is this Reddit group that created havoc. So they sent GameStop's price soaring. More than 1700% created crazy market turbulence. Well, that very group is now talking about throwing sand in the gears yet again because they are grumbling about Reddit becoming more corporate. Reddit could be inviting this because the company has agreed to set aside 8% of its stock to power users who volunteered around this site. It's Reddit's way of giving back. Betting for the stock to decline even as Steve Huffman tries to make it what he calls a something that behaves like an adult company. This right Huffman wants the company to mature and more than 70 million redditors just wanted to stay a fun childish playground. This is really the core tension here, Steve, right between the users and its corporate shift. And here's Bobby Allen. Thanks so much. Thanks Steve. And that's up first for Thursday March 21st.

And Elon Musk suits OpenAI, saying it abandoned its founding mission. If this case makes it to court, I mean we could see a courtroom debate over pretty abstract concepts like how dangerous is AI and what constitutes so-called artificial general intelligence and does chat GPT already meet that threshold. Plus, shares of New York Community Bank Corps Psync, reviving worries about the stability of regional banks. It's Friday March 1st. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. Boeing is in talks to acquire spirit aerosystems, the troubled jet fuselage supplier at the center of quality issues affecting 737 MAX jets. People familiar with the matter say spirits hired bankers to explore strategic options and has had preliminary discussions with Boeing, though they may not result in a deal. A tie-up would mark a strategic reversal for Boeing, which split off from spirit two decades ago. The supplier has been beset by production issues. Spirits also exploring selling operations in Ireland that make parts for Boeing's chief rival Airbus. CBS and Walgreens will begin selling the abortion pill Miffa Pristone in the coming weeks. The pharmacy chain said today they received certification to dispense the pills after a regulatory shift last year that allows brick and mortar pharmacies to offer the pill with a prescription. The pharmacies said the pill wouldn't be offered in states that don't allow legal access to abortion through 10 weeks, nor would they be available via mail order. The pill is at the center of litigation before the Supreme Court, which will consider whether the food and drug administration properly loosened restrictions around it. President Biden says the U.S. will begin air-dropping humanitarian aid to Gaza in the next few days to help bring relief to Palestinians caught in the Israel-Hamas war. Biden spoke from the Oval Office earlier today. The announcement comes after a chaotic series of events involving a convoy of aid trucks in the Gaza Strip yesterday, where Israeli troops opened fire on civilians. The Israeli military and Palestinian witnesses gave conflicting accounts. Gaza health officials said more than 100 Palestinians were killed and hundreds more injured. Palestinians said Israeli troops opened fire on civilians. Israeli officials said Palestinians were trampled to death by panicked crowds or run over by aid truck drivers trying to escape the chaos, and that Palestinian gunmen had also opened fire. The U.S. officials said the plan to drop relief supplies into Gaza signals U.S. recognition that current efforts to address the humanitarian crisis haven't been sufficient and reflects the pressure on President Biden to act. Shares of regional lender New York Community Bank Corp fell over 25 percent today. After the bank disclosed problems with controls, took a $2.4 billion charge and replaced its CEO. Markets reporter Gina Hebe has more details. The U.S. officials said the plan to drop relief supplies into Gaza is already a big concern because that sector is under pressure. NYCB's troubles revived fears about the stability of regional banks a year after a string of high-profile failures. Coming up, why Elon Musk is suing open AI and its CEO Sam Altman, and what it could mean for the future of the technology after the break. Hey what's news fans, listen up. But that's not all. And it's already included in your prime membership. That's amazon.com slash what's news. It's just that easy. Silicon Valley investors and startups are joining the race for hypersonic weapons, which the US military has struggled to figure out China and Russia already have them ready for use on the battlefield. Hypersonic aircraft and weapons travel at least five times the speed of sound or 3,800 miles an hour. Venture capitalists have invested more than $500 million into US startups working on the systems in the past two years. This is a big pivot for VCs. It's really notable for a couple of reasons going back the past two decades or so really since the dot com boom. If you just look at hardware, difficult, expensive hardware systems, not even with military applications. That's not been a sector where there's been tremendous venture capital interest. Software is eating the world as Mark Andreessen said and the dollars followed software. They followed social media consumer facing apps and business facing software. That's really been the focus of VC for the past couple decades. The second reason it's notable is just it's probably one of the most ambitious and unlikely ventures into this military tech space. As VC gets more deep into defense tech, this is really quite a stunning evolution in their enthusiasm for building tech that they hope the military will buy. Defense Department spokesman said the Pentagon's hypersonic strategy isn't based on trying to match China or Russia and it shouldn't be compared with any other country. Along simmering feud between tech industry titans is escalating this time over the future of artificial intelligence billionaire Elon Musk has sued open AI and its CEO Sam Altman. The big allegation Musk claims they broke the AI company's founding agreement by giving priority to profit over the benefits to humanity. The lawsuit filed late yesterday in San Francisco pits one of the world's richest people, Musk, against the world's most valuable company, Microsoft, a major backer of open AI. The battle also touches on a core debate over AI. How scared should we be as the technologies capabilities grow? Sam, thank you for being here. Always a pleasure. Sam, could you remind us of Elon Musk's history with open AI and what he's after with this lawsuit? Well, Elon Musk is one of the founders of open AI along with Sam Altman and others. He was started in part as a counterweight to Google, which was very powerful in AI at the time. And also was based in part in Musk's idea that AI could become very dangerous to humanity and should be controlled by an entity that is serving all humans, not just the for profit interests of one company. Now, as the lawsuit portrays it, Elon over time started to clash with Sam Altman and others over becoming for profit, finding other ways to make money. He thought that that wasn't a good idea according to the lawsuit. And eventually in 2018, he stepped down from the company's board. And he continued to supply funding, but he drifted away from the company and now has a rival company called XAI. So he is a competitor with open AI at this point. Does that play some role in motivating this lawsuit? That's hard to say. It's certainly not in the text of the lawsuit, but it's not unusual for commercial competitors to attack each other in court. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. How are open AI and Sam Altman responding? Well, open AI declined to comment on the lawsuit, but Sam Altman has said that the company takes its safety application seriously and that the technology should be developed with great caution. The company still stands by its mission to make AI for the benefit of humanity. I think they would say that there's a free version of chat GPT for everyone to use. As for Microsoft, Microsoft isn't a party to the lawsuit. And finally, Sam, what is that stake here? The allegations in Musk's lawsuit really get to the heart of the debate over AI that's going on among policymakers, people in the tech industry, and sort of the public at large. Well, if this case makes it to court, I mean, we could see a courtroom debate over pretty abstract concepts like how dangerous is AI and what constitutes so-called artificial general intelligence and does chat GPT already meet that threshold? Those are the kinds of allegations that are made, and if Musk gets his way, open AI could be ordered to become a nonprofit or Microsoft could lose its license to use the most advanced version of chat GPT. There's a long way to go between now and such a court order. You know, lawsuits often shoot for the moon when it comes to what they're asking for in terms of relief. And there could be a settlement. There could be plenty of other things in between, but it would certainly be fun if we saw Sam Altman taking a stand and answering some of these questions. And finally, Wendy's got a lot of negative attention this week after a slew of news articles saying the fast food chain was implementing surge pricing. It all started with a mid-February earnings call where the company's new CEO, Kirk Tanner, said Wendy's would begin testing features like dynamic pricing as early as next year. The detail was pretty much glossed over at the time, but led to quite a backlash this week when headlines began comparing Wendy's strategy to that of ride-hailing company Uber, which raises prices due to heavy demand. It all forced Wendy's to put out a statement of saying it wouldn't beef up prices for burgers and disavowing that it intends to use surge pricing. Our heard on the street columnist Spencer Jacobs says it probably could have been handled better. Search pricing is something you think of with ticket master or Uber also airlines airlines have done it for decades. It's a fairly normal thing. Dynamic pricing is a more sort of benign word for it, but it happens in all industries. And for some reason, people seized on this and so we know Wendy's came out and said no, we will not be raising prices during busy times. I don't think they expected to have a PR blowback, but there's a way to frame things that are positive. So yes, Wendy's is now focusing on better deals for customers. It says new digital menus could allow it to offer discounts at slower times. And that's what's news for this week.

We know you care about what you watch, what you read and what you listen to. Listen tonight. Russia's presidential election begins today and yes, Vladimir Putin will almost certainly win. This is Russia. Nothing happens without cement rig. Now Putin is widely expected to secure a fifth term in office extending his hold on power through at least 2030, maybe longer. So do Russian voters really have a choice? And Paira Strauss means is on the line from Moscow. Good morning. Good morning. So you were out at polling stations. What have you been seeing? Yeah, I was out at a polling station at a school in central Moscow. When voting got underway this morning, there was a small but steady trickle of voters including Anastasia and Alexei, both doctors who work in Russia's state hospital system. And when we spoke outside, I asked, I thought the obvious question is Russian democracy healthy. Hello. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Anastasia who can hear their chuckling says yes, it is. Alexei had a different take that democracy doesn't exist anywhere. But either way, they said Russia's faith in President Putin was strong and that's who they cast their ballots for. So it sounds like Putin is up by two votes then? Yeah, he's on his way. But of course it's early going. There are three full days of voting ahead. That's a first for presidential elections here. The government is also pushing new online voting in about a third of the country. Previously, it had only been tested in Moscow. And this election has distinct for another reason. Russia's military is securing voting for people in areas of Ukraine that Moscow claims to have annexed, in other words, the occupied territories. Now the Central Election Commission here says all of these moves are designed to offer greater voter access. But Kremlin critics and it must be said independent election experts argue these moves open the door to potential vote rigging. Or if you look at Russia's recent history of elections, more vote rigging. The track record here isn't good. Yeah, but Putin is popular. At least polls tell us so. So why should anyone be surprised or even outraged if or more like when he wins? Yeah, there's no question. Putin has his supporters, particularly among older Russians, attracted to Putin's blend of Soviet nostalgia, nationalist conservatism. So Putin would no doubt do well, but would he do as well as these polls claim? If you believe media reports that cite government leaks, the Kremlin has instructed regional governors and other state officials to secure a historic result for the president. One that shows that people are behind Putin not despite, but because of his decision to invade Ukraine. Abaskaliyamov, a former speech writer for the Kremlin, turned critic in exile, says this generated mandate is about maintaining Putin's legitimacy at home, even if there's a danger of overdoing it. It's not enough just to produce the result. It's necessary to be convincing so that your result is believed. Now, there are other candidates though, right? Yeah, there are three members from various doom of factions in the parliament that are in the race. They all basically support Putin's policies and don't seem particularly interested in competing. Meanwhile, those who are did not make it on the ballot to anti-war candidates were disqualified over supposed registration violations. And of course, Putin's fiercest challenger, Alexei Navalny, died in a remote prison column under a circumstance that still aren't clear. Navalny's allies certainly think his death or murder was time to these elections. In fact, they're calling people to honor Navalny's last known political wish to protest the vote by swarming the polling stations at noon on Sunday. And here's Charles Mainz in Moscow. Thank you for your reporting. Thank you. In Haiti, there aren't many certainties in life, but chaos may be one of them. After all, this is a country that over the years has experienced coups, transitional governments, assassinations, and gang violence. But the turmoil of the last two weeks has reached new levels. There has been no leadership, no law in order in the capital and a dwindling supply of humanitarian aid. The country has been effectively cut off from the outside world with armed gangs in control of most of Port Prince. And PR's Ada Peralta has managed to get across the border no easy feat, and he's in Haiti's second city of capatian. Hey Ada, glad you're able to get in there. Hey, Leyla. So what have you seen so far? I mean, look like happens in these situations. We've seen a lot of normal restaurants are open. People are out buying groceries here in capatian, which used to be a tourist hub. There's music and dancing and people at bars, but it also doesn't take long to see the signs that something is wrong here. Fuel is running out. It's nearly twice as expensive as it used to be. And some towns up and down this northern coast are in complete darkness. They haven't had consistent electricity since this crisis has started. And that means when President Joe Vennel Mouiz was assassinated in 2021, and also as we were driving in, we ran into large groups of Haitians who were getting ready to try to run away from this place. They were about to try to cross the border into the Dominican Republic. Wow. So as you cross in, you see this group of people trying to escape. What are people you're meeting telling you about the situation? I mean, the people I've spoken to tell me that they're happy that in these parts of Haiti, at least, the gunfire has stopped. And now some schools and some universities have reopened. But I've also heard a lot of desolation. Haitians feel abandoned. They feel that after their president was killed, no one was listening. And you know, they don't just mean the international community. They mean their own government. I spoke to one man who used to work as a tourist guide. And now he's just trying to find any kind of work to keep food on his table. And he says what's happening in Haiti is not just criminal gangs revolting. He says this is an awakening. He said that Haitians have lived in poverty and neglect and misery for too long. And they're just fed up. And this is an uprising. He says. Wow. Now the Capitol Port of Prince has effectively been under siege by gangs for the last two weeks. Is there any sign that the violence there is subsiding? We thought it was, but yesterday was a very violent day in the Capitol. Gang shot at the airport. Just as workers were trying to fix the damage that had been done during previous attacks. And local news reported that gangs had also looted the House of the Director of National Police and then set it on fire. One of the prisons, which was already empty from an earlier prison break, was also set on fire. And this is absolutely without a doubt a political statement from the armed gangs in the country. This renewed violence is happening while different political parties and affiliations are trying to shape this transitional council that was proposed by the international community. And some prominent gang leaders have come out against this agreement saying it doesn't represent the will of the Haitian people. And this violence seems to be the way they plan to oppose it. Now the US has finally appointed an ambassador to Haiti. What do we know about him? So it's Dennis Haskins and his nomination was approved by the Senate yesterday. And the important part is that this marks the first time the US has had an ambassador in Haiti for nearly two and a half years. Thank you so much. Thank you, Leyla. Leaders in Chicago once promised to welcome migrants seeking asylum. Now they're reversing course. 37,000 asylum seekers have journeyed to the shores of Lake Michigan over the last two years. Along with several other cities in the US, Chicago says its shelters have reached capacity. So starting Saturday, the city will start evicting some migrants. Good morning. Good morning. So, Jasmine, why is this starting now? We know last fall, New York City told migrants they could stay for 30 to 60 days at shelters. And around that time, Chicago kind of positioned itself as a more welcoming city. Here's Mayor Brandon Johnson at a press conference five months ago. The policies that are impacting populations shifts around the globe is affecting us all. These are asylum seekers. These are not illegal people. But this has already cost Chicago nearly $160 million. And the city says it can't handle it. So it enacted a similar policy to New York, a 60-day eviction rule. And that goes into effect Saturday, as many as 5,600 people could be told to leave. So quite a reversal there for this city. And it has to be a polarizing issue for people in Chicago. What's the response been like? Well, the decision has been divisive. Many in local governments say, despite its best intentions, months of sheltering people have worn Chicago's budget and patients thin. But there's a lot of opposition too. Alderman Andre Vasquez, chair of the city's committee on immigrant and refugee rights, says the city can do better. So not only is it not the right way to go when we're thinking about the dignity everybody deserves in the situation and we're talking about families with children in school, it also isn't being responsible at a taxpayer dollar because it's going to lead to more cost down the line. He predicts it will lead to increased homelessness, more visits to the ER and cost Chicago more. So you mentioned that New York City enacted a similar policy last year. Has that been working? New York officials say as of December of last year, over 22,000 people were told it was time to leave the shelter. And about a quarter were able to stay in the system. But City Hall doesn't know a lot about what happens to people when they leave the shelters. I've been talking to migrants who are now sleeping in parks, streets, under bridges. These people are allowed to stay in the country for now, but they can't work legally. I mean, you can stay, but you can't work to support yourself? That's exactly right. When a migrant seeks asylum, the law says they can't get a work permit until five months after applying for that asylum. And mayors have brought this up to the White House in Congress as something that could alleviate the financial stress of caring for people. Yeah, but we've seen even immigration proposals with bipartisan support seem to go nowhere in Washington. So is there any sign that conditions on the ground in these cities might change? Not really. This all started two years ago with the surge of migrants at the border. Text to Republican Governor Greg Abbott started busing migrants to cities like New York, Chicago, Denver. And Abbott has pledged to continue sending migrants north. He says as a way to get the Biden administration to ramp up border enforcement. So this is going to continue. And PR's immigration course for under Jasmine Garz. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for having me. And that's up first for Friday, March 15th. I'm Layla Faldon. And I'm Hay Martinez.

Israel's response to Hamas in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of people and now hunger is killing people too. The United Nations and independent experts say famine is imminent in Gaza where people have already starved to death. This Blinken last night in Cairo. Children should not be dying of malnutrition in Gaza or anywhere else for that matter. 100% of the population of Gaza is experiencing severe levels of acute food insecurity. We cannot. We must not allow that to continue. Aya, good morning. Good morning, Michelle. So we heard from Mr. Blinken saying children shouldn't be dying of hunger in Gaza, but as we just said, doctors and aid workers say many already have, is that the focus of this trip? And I want to mention that this is Mr. Blinken's sixth visit since the October 7th attacks by Hamas that killed 1200 people and were hostages were taken and so forth. Is that the focus of this trip? Well, I mean, with each trip, he's come with a new message. Now with the White House's doing, it's throwing its weight behind ceasefire talks being mediated by Qatar and Egypt for Hamas to release some of the hostages taken on October 7th in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian captives and to flood Gaza with aid to stave off looming famine there. Now Biden says he hopes a six week truce could then be extended to basically wind down this war that's decimated Gaza and killed more than 32,000 people there according to the health ministry. But Israel's government says Hamas operates in Rafa. That's the southern town where most of Gaza's population have been displaced and they've planned a ground operation there. So another point of Lincoln's message is to say this would be a mistake and he says this is something the U.S. cannot support. And what about those ceasefire talks? Where do they stand now? Blinken said yesterday in Cairo there are still serious gaps between Hamas and Israel in the terms of this truce and the heads of the CIA, Egyptian and Israeli intelligence are supposed to be meeting again today in Qatar to talk about that. Now Israel says it launched a raid on a key hospital in Gaza city this week where Hamas had regrouped to pressure those talks. But regardless, Lincoln says a ceasefire cannot be the only way to get aid in to people who need it in Gaza. And he said, quote, Israel needs to do more. So the U.S. continues to ramp up the pressure. What has Israel's response been to U.S. calls to do more? Israel says it is allowing an aid, but it's very limited because they don't want Hamas to benefit from it. Aid groups though say it is not nearly enough to feed the population and now the White House is urging Israel to loosen its border controls to get that aid that's sitting on trucks and warehouses to people starving to death just a few miles away across the border. And A, before we let you go, what can you tell us about the latest in the situation on the ground now in Gaza? I mean, look, we've seen images of these desperate crowds grabbing aid off trucks, bags of flour and children just wasting away in hospitals literally dying of hunger, especially in the north of Gaza. The UN is looking for better ways to distribute that aid with the help of local police and Gaza and community leaders or with their known as clans or popular committees. Now, these clans say they're willing to help, but they don't intend to replace Hamas on the ground and have denounced Israel. But this week we saw a string of Israeli attacks on these guys from clan members to senior police officers whose job it is to oversee the distribution in the north. Israel says the police are an arm of Hamas and they didn't respond to our request for comment on those airstrikes. That is Enpios A. B. Taui intubai. A. A. Thank you. Thanks, Michelle. First, this week Reddit went public and as soon as today truth social might be next. Donald Trump's social media platform is seeking to merge with a little known public company. That company's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the merger later this morning and if it goes through, it sets the stage for stock sales and Trump stands to make a lot of money. Enpios Rafael Nam is here with us to bring us up to speed. Good morning. Good morning, Michelle. Rafael, I understand that this is not the same process for going public that Reddit used yesterday. Can you explain what's happening here? So this is supposed to be a simple vote, but the whole process has been so convoluted. It's a shell company. It was specifically created to merge with Trump's company in markets. It's called a backdoor listing. It's a way to go public in a different way from a traditional IPO and later this morning shareholders need to actually approve the merger. The big question is if we're going to see enough shareholders show up to vote, if that goes through though, that would be fantastic news for President Trump. He would own over 50% of the new company. That would be worth over $3 billion. That's three with a huge chunk of change. Okay. So $3 billion, like you said, a huge chunk of change. This truth social worth that much. No, it is not. I mean, let's look at the numbers. This is a company that only had over $3 million in sales for the first nine months of last year. That's three with an M this time and he lost nearly $50 million. Nonetheless, the value here is President Trump. Without Trump, there is no truth social. He has millions of supporters and right now a lot of the shareholders in the deal are believed to be Trump supporters. They are the true believers. They are people who want to support Trump no matter what. And they will happily buy the shares. And then there are the professional investors like Matthew Tuttle, who runs his own investment firm. I reached out to him yesterday to see why he's investing in the company and he was a front about it. He thinks he can make a quick buck. While fundamentally I don't get it, I'm going to trade it because it's going to move. It's going to have a rabbit following and it's going to be a fun stock. But of course, like I was saying, nobody stands to gain more than Trump. So can the former president dump his shares immediately and also make a quick buck? So this is where Trump could run into a problem. That's because under the merger, he has to hold on to his shares for another six months. But this is Donald Trump. I mean, who knows? He could work out a side deal with the other shareholders because the bottom line is that he needs to raise money immediately for all his legal cases. He does have the clock ticking. Next Monday, he has to come up with over $400 million to post bond. That's for New York's fraud case against him, his family and the Trump organization. How soon will those shares start trading? Well, if the shareholders do approve the deal today, it would start trading as a new company by next week. It could be very volatile and told, but hey, it would now be officially called Trump Media and Technology Group with a new stock symbol, DJT, Donald J. Trump. Rahel, thank you. Thank you, Michelle. For years now, Apple has portrayed itself as the responsible corporate citizen with beloved product designs. Now, the Justice Department in 16 states are suing Apple, saying its smartphones were designed to limit competition. Many general Merrick Garland says Apple profits not by making its own products better, but by making other products worse. Wendy Lee covers entertainment and business for the Los Angeles Times and she's with us now from the San Francisco Bay Area to tell us more about it. Good morning, Wendy. Good morning. So, obviously, it's a big deal when the Justice Department takes on one of the world's biggest companies, but how big of a deal could this be for consumers? This could be a really big deal for consumers because Apple owns the hardware, the iPhone, the software behind it, and also all the apps on the iPhone have to go through the App Store, which Apple controls. So is the DOJ succeed in this lawsuit that could dramatically change how Apple does business, which could theoretically cause prices to be less for consumers? So, in his remarks, Attorney General Garland made his case for how he said consumers are suffering from this alleged monopoly. This is what he said. There are choices, higher prices and fees, lower quality smartphones, apps and accessories, and less innovation from Apple and its competitors. A lot of consumers get their smartphones through companies like AT&T or Verizon who offer discounts and even free phone upgrades with contracts. I mean, anytime you turn on the television, you see those. So how does the DOJ argue that we're actually paying more money for their iPhones because of Apple's business practices? So, if Apple owns the iPhone as well as the software in the App Store, that Apple also sells all these accessories with the phone. So if you're an Apple user and you're going to use a smartwatch, you probably are going to buy an Apple Watch and Apple Watch has only work with iPhones. So if one wanted to buy a Google phone, all of a sudden you have to buy a new smartwatch because your Apple Watch won't work with the Google phone. And so I think that's one way in which the DOJ is arguing that Steiffel's competition. The other way is in the App Store itself, that Apple takes up to 30% cut of the App Store subscriptions and in-app purchases and many developers pass on that cost to consumers. So how's the company responding? Well, the company disagrees with lawsuit and also the company believes that it threatens how Apple does business and also says that could hinder its ability to create the type of technology that people expect from Apple. If this lawsuit does force Apple to change its behavior, can you just give us a sense of how consumers might benefit? Yeah, I mean, I think that some of the ways that consumers could benefit is lower prices on apps. Also that some of the functionality between iPhone users and Android users, such as when Apple users use the iMessage to message Android users, that green message that you get on your iMessage, that might change, that functionality might improve. And it's also possible that Apple might open up its app store to other types of apps that the DOJ is alleging that it hasn't really been open to. All right, so potentially some big changes. That is L.A. Times reporter Wendy Lee. Wendy, thank you so much. Thank you. And that's up first for Friday, March 22nd. I'm Michelle Martin. And I'm Steve Innscape.

Now our economy is literally the envy of the world. 15 million new jobs in just three years are record. I'm Jessica Rosenthal. This weekend essentially became a two-man race with Nikki Haley exiting the Republican contest. But did her supporters like what President Biden had to say at the state of the union? Or are they still looking for someone else to vote for? Some of them are just dead set against Trump. They're not going to vote for him no matter what. But that doesn't necessarily mean that they would vote for Biden either. They might write someone in. They might vote third party. They might leave the top of the ticket blank. One of the biggest headwinds President Biden faces in his reelection bid is the economy. The majority of independence 81 percent rate the economy is only fair or poor. And more than half of all voters say they have less money in their pockets today than a year ago. So it's not surprising the president is trying to reverse those sentiments. I inherited economists on the brink. Now our economy is literally the envy of the world. 15 million new jobs in just three years are record. A record. Unemployment. At 50 year low. Record 16 million American are starting small businesses and each one is a little act of hope. President Biden also laid out new proposals designed to bring down costs he says to make life more affordable for more Americans. One that will be unveiled in the White House budget this month would create a new tax credit for new home buyers as much as 5,000 bucks a year for two years. I know the cost of housing is so important to you. Inflation keeps coming down mortgage rates will come down as well and the Fed acknowledges that. But I'm not waiting. I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgage is when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space. Jared Bernstein is chair of President Biden's Council of Economic Advisers helping craft policies like tax credits. He joined me to talk about that proposal to President's message to boost confidence in the economy and the Friday jobs report employers added 275,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate stayed below 4%. Well, it's certainly clear that we have a very strong and a very healthy job market that just continues to defy expectations and look from our perspective. That's just on equivately good news. In terms of a sustainability question, there you really need to look at inflation and wage growth and you see something really important there, Jared. You see inflation coming down, down 6 percentage points off of its peak. So that's been great to see. When you see nominal wage growth coming in at a more sustainable pace, but the important point is that wages are outpacing inflation. So inflation is slowing faster than the wage growth is slowing. It's decelerating more quickly. And that means real wage gains. So that's sort of a nerdy economist way of explaining that we're seeing real wage gains for something like 10 months in a row now. We don't have inflation for February, so we don't know. Remember, wages grew 4.3% over the past year, and that's very likely, of course, to be ahead of inflation. As you look at that, I know one of the concerns as the Fed was trying to handle inflation and sort of slow down business spending a little bit with the increased interest rates, do you run a risk now of seeing that inflation tick back up as folks are kind of spending more money as folks are getting back into the labor market? Well, first of all, folks getting back into the labor market and we're seeing some nice movement in that direction for women, primate women in this report. I think this is kind of under the hood, so it's been under reported. We saw a real nice tick up in their labor force participation rate, and it's close to its historical high going back, you know, I think 70 years. So that's helpful on inflation because that's a supply side advantage. It increases the economy's capacity and puts downward pressure on inflation. In terms of interest rates in the Fed, obviously, we don't get into monetary policy, but the trajectory of inflation continues to come down. And yes, you're going to have months that are going to blip one way or the other, but even the CPI, which came in hotter than expected in January, it was 3.4% in December. And 3.1% in January. So it grew more slowly. I think the expectation would come down even more, but the trends is our friend. It's moving in the right direction, and we have every reason to speak that to expect that to be the case. You mentioned consumer spending. Let me say a word about that, because it's been so important to our economic recovery. One of the things that's happening, it's again, it's sort of nuanced under the hood. One of the things that's happening in our macro economy, our overall economy, is that a lot of people have burned through what was their excess savings. So during the pandemic, people had a lot of savings because they weren't spending as much money on services during the pandemic, and also because of the fiscal support. At least for the bottom half, three quarters, I think they burned through most of that. And you might think, oh, that's going to go the other way from your question. That's going to hurt consumer spending. But as excess savings has burned off, real wages and incomes have come up. And I think there's a kind of baton handing there on the consumer side, and it's looked good to me. But to that point, credit card debt is at an all time high. Is that a healthy thing for the economy? Certainly, it seems like a dangerous position for a lot of families to be in. Holy fair question, Jared. And I think the thing to look at there, so the idea that credit card debt, because there's just more and more people over time, and they have credit cards and probably have more credit cards, it's... Credit card debt is one of those things like GDP. It's the highest ever, every quarter, because it just generally goes up. The question, you have to scale it by something. So if you look at credit card debt with respect to income, and you consider the fact that income has been going up, and you ask, how easy is it for people to service that debt? That's the key economic question. We think it looks very serviceable and something that we're going to put on our watch list, but not worrisome at this point. Is that watch list like what is the default rate end up being? Is that what the concern would be? The watch list is all the variables that you might think of as banana peels. We have a good economy. We have a great macro economy. We have a great GDP growth. We have a great labor market, unemployment. As of this morning, below 4% for 25 months in a row, real wage gains. But there's always banana peels out there. That's my watch list. Credit card debt, really debt of all types, is something that lives on the watch list because you have to monitor its sustainability. The way we look at it, though, is debt service. Given rising incomes, we look at credit card debt relative to incomes, and that looks moderate to us. Is the White House, is President Biden specifically frustrated at interest rates in kind of how slowly that they seem to be leveling off? I know you don't want to get involved in dictate to the Fed, but he did talk about interest rates in the Senate of the Union last night. So I think the first thing that comes to mind in hearing your question is coming off last night's performance in the state of the Union, this President is anything but frustrated. I just think you'll watch that speech. What you see is optimism is just absolutely fiery spirit. A President who is clearly painting a key contrast between competing visions for the country, if not the soul of the nation. And so I don't think frustration and Biden belong in the same sentence right now. And in terms of interest rates, I think the important thing there gets to the housing discussion. He talked about housing in some debt last night. And I think that was really important. The cost of housing is so important. And he knows that affordability remains a challenge. We have a housing shortage, affordable housing shortage that was 10 years in the making. And one of the things that President talked about last night was a first time, first generation home buyer tax credit that actually offsets about a point and a half of the mortgage rate in terms of what it means to people who are trying to buy home. So we're very sensitive to that. We're working part to try to help. That's what I wanted to sort of hone in on. This $5,000 tax credit for mortgages. I want to go a little bit deeper in this because it is, it seems like a brand new kind of policy that the president laid out in the state of the union. You're going to need congressional buy-in for this. Explain to me kind of the logistics in the mechanics. So this would be short term, right? The president said over a two year period. Well, what he, it's 10,000, not 5,000 because it's 5,000 for two years. So that's what it's going to buy. Yeah. It's a $10,000 tax credit for first time home buyers. And it is part of an agenda to build or renovate more than two million homes. And there's lots of other policy in there as well. There have been first time home buyer credits before. It's not that unusual policy. You're absolutely right that we need a Congress. I think what's salient about it right now is that the pressures on home buyers and part of that is the high mortgage rate. But part of it is just a really undersupplied market where supply and demand are just misaligned. Home prices have really remained high. So that's an intervention that as I mentioned will help significantly offset that cost for lower income people. But I think the key there is that we can't just work on that sort of demand side of the equation. We have to work on the supply side. And there again, we have detailed plans to renovate millions of home, build millions of home. And by the way, we're also very happy to see that nearly 1.7 million homes are currently under construction. And that's a record in terms of home under construction. And by the way, those are mostly multifamily dwellings, which are very important on the rental side. A couple of follow ups on that one is as far as this tax credit that the president proposed, is it sort of means tested? What are the caps for it? Who would qualify? Who wouldn't? At how are we sort of defining first home buyer in this context? So these details will come out with a budget next week. So I don't want to get to them. But yes, it will be targeted at middle and lower income people. And it will be, in that sense, it goes further because it's a larger share of their income. So it helps them. Are there enough existing homes that lower income and middle income Americans can afford right now? Home prices are so high, even for pretty modest dwellings. The answer to your question is a hard no. There are not adequate existing homes. And in fact, our team estimates that the gap between what we have and what we need in terms of housing in general and affordable housing in particular is somewhere in the three to four million range. And this is, as I said, this has been building for 10 years. This met us when we got here. And we started right away to try to help. And in fact, we've been able to reduce mortgage insurance premiums by $800 a year for thousands of first time home buyers, expanded rental assistance to 100,000 households. And as I mentioned, 1.7 million homes under construction right now, mostly multifamily. Now it's positive. By the way, one thing that slipped by I think people didn't quite catch it in the speech last night was actions that we plan to take in this space to significantly reduce the cost of title insurance, especially for refinance. Title insurance is one of the ways that people get ripped off when they're refinancing their home. And it can be thousands of dollars. And you need title insurance. So that'll be there. But it shouldn't cost that much. And Fannie and Freddie already have a pilot program that's working well in that space. And we want to expand that. When we look at sort of this housing initiative and the mortgage initiative, I know you still kind of have to work through it at the budget process. But is there an assessment of a prediction on kind of what that cost, what this $10,000 credit would cost and whether or not it would be offset somewhere else through tax revenue? Yeah. Again, these are detailed budget questions and my apologies. I don't know. I talk about the budget when it comes out, but I can give you some rough ideas. First of all, anytime you talk about getting bipartisan cooperation, I'm sure a lot of people think, well, that's not going to happen. But it's an interesting thing in housing because it's not really a red, blue thing, right? I mean, there are housing shortages in red places and blue places all across the country. And so it turns out that for some of the measures, expanding the low income housing tax credit, that's a good example. Now, expanding liTeX, that's the acronym for the low income housing tax credit. Expanding liTeX is both in the bill that the house recently passed. So this tax bill that the house recently passed, tax extenders for businesses, but also includes the child tax credit. It's been under reported that there's an expansion of liTeX in there that should help to build 200,000 affordable units. That passed the house. There are actually hundreds of members on both sides of the aisle who support these issues. Now in our budget to get to your other question, we have a set of measures to expand affordable housing that come to around 250 billion over 10 years in expenditures fully paid for. So happy to come back and go through the details on that. You seem to like to get into the budget we have in that. That's what we need. I know because obviously the deficit and things that are the president talks a lot about, trying to reduce the deficit and have different mechanisms to pay for these types of programs. Certainly the president talked a little bit about that in the context of billionaires in corporate tax rates. Let me finish with this. And this is kind of more at a much sort of 10,000 feet level. Biden at least polling suggests it's still underwater as it relates to handling of the economy. What can we expect to hear from him, hear from the team over the next sort of eight months to turn that sentiment around? I think that sentiment is already starting to turn around. Over the past three months, the consumer sentiment measure that's most closely washed is up surging really. Up 25% in three months. I think that we haven't seen an increase like that for 30 years, I believe. And our theory of the case coming from the president himself has long been, if we can maintain a tight job market, which we saw this morning, by the way, for February, so let's not forget that jobs, or I don't want to get lost in all the news we have today. It's a great job support. If we can maintain that job market, well, continuing to ease inflationary pressures, we should see real wages and real incomes grow. Exactly where our conversation started. Under that kind of a set of conditions, people's paychecks by definition, the buying power is increased. We're also doing everything we can to lower costs. We just talked about title insurance, but there's junk fees. You heard the president talk last night about healthcare prescription drugs, measures, by the way, which are opponents are trying to repeal, which would lead to higher costs in those areas. If we can keep lowering costs while keeping real wages and incomes going up, we what we said, sentiment will start to come up. In fact, that's precisely what we've seen, and not just a blip, but for about three months running. We think we're on the right track. Our work isn't done, Jerry. We have to build on the progress we've made. But, directionally, I think we're in a strong place. Jerry, to appreciate the time as always, I like that you let me get into the weeds a little bit with you. It's always fun for me and enjoy the weekend and we'll be in touch soon. Sounds good. Thanks, Jerry. Bye bye. This past week, several states voted in what is known as Super Tuesday and every state but Vermont went for former President Trump on the Republican ticket. Nikki Haley announced the suspension of her campaign the next day. In all likelihood, Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee when our party convention meets in July. I congratulate him and wish him well. I wish anyone well who would be America's president. Our country is too precious to let our differences divide us. Heading into Super Tuesday, former President Trump spoke from Mar-a-Lago after the Supreme Court said Colorado couldn't kick him off the ballot. Historically, a thing like what I've been going through would have hurt a political party or a political candidate. Terrifically, you wouldn't even run. You wouldn't be able to run. You'd get out. This has happened over many years, many times. In this case, the polls show that I'm much more popular than I was before weaponization. Arguing that President Biden should have all the legal cases against him dropped, Biden did not sound open to such a possibility. In his third state of the Union address, this one given in an election year, his speech was political, as he mentioned, former President Trump several times, though not by name. A former Republican president tells Putin, quote, do whatever the hell you want. My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6. Many of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. My God, what freedom else would you take away? So to President Biden make the case to Nikki Haley supporters, his campaign set after she suspended her campaign that there was a place in his campaign for her voters. Well, I think it depends on what profile of Nikki Haley's support you're talking to, right? There are certainly some of them who are just Democrats who plan to vote for the Democratic ticket in the fall. They were always going to do that. But in the Republican primary, they felt like perhaps their vote was better used crossing over to the Republican side and trying to lodge some sort of protest against Donald Trump or block him in some way. Those voters, that group of them obviously will just move right along to November and they'll be voting for the Biden ticket. Then you've got the more complicated group of Haley voters and I think most of these voters are conservatives or Republicans or independents who are generally predisposed to vote for the GOP and have done so in the past, but they have trouble getting over the hump with Donald Trump and have done so maybe even all the way back to 2016. They just wrestle with him as a political figure as a leader of the party. And so I think some of them, I know a number of them, some of them are just dead set against Trump. They're not going to vote for him no matter what, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they would vote for Biden either. They might write someone in. They might vote third party. They might leave the top of the ticket blank. They're just trying to figure that out. They might write her in, right? Then you've got other people who probably still dislike Joe Biden and his governing outcome so much that they're going to vote for the Republican nominee no matter who it is. They just didn't want it to be Trump, but if it's him and particularly depending on who he picks, says his vice presidential nominee and sort of how the general election campaign is fought, they are probably gravitating to be Trump supporters. So I think there's probably going to be this interesting mix between partisan Democrats just going back to their normal voting patterns. And then the center right voters just deciding, can I pull the lever for this man or not? I think it would be wise and would be who Trump to try to pull as many of them in as possible because most of those hailey voters are strongly, strongly disapproving of the job Joe Biden is doing as president. So her dropping out when she did it like is that it from her? You know, just to your point about where some of these voters could go because she'd said I don't want to do no labels. You know, I'm a conservative. A unity ticket is not interesting to me, but she said the voices of the millions of people who don't want to rematch between Biden and Trump should be heard. How guy should they be heard? Should RFK junior hear them? Like would she endorse him? Possibly if it's not going to be hers, the independent. No, I mean, I'd be very surprised. Who knows politics can be weird and things can move around, but I'd be very surprised if she endorsed anyone other than Donald Trump. She might not endorse anyone or if she's going to endorse, I think it would be Trump. I would argue that the voices that she's describing, the millions of them have been heard. At least in these early states, there have been options for people. If they were really unhappy with the choices at hand from both major parties, they had a chance to come out and vote for Dean Phillips or uncommitted or Mary Ann Williamson or something like that on the Democratic side or any number of candidates on the Republican side, all the way back to Iowa. How many of them made the ballot? Quite a few. There was a chance for people to do exactly what she's describing and elections matter, results have consequences and the vast majority of people overall, certainly on the Democratic side and a sizable majority on the Republican side, they've decided, you know what, the rematch that the polls suggest broadly is an unpopular rematch. That's the rematch, at least on their end that they want to see and that's how democracy works. That's the rematch we're going to get in all likelihood. Do you see the results from Tuesday guy like, okay, every state went for Trump except Vermont. So Trump, wow, he's the party's guy. Or were there enough double digit numbers in Nikki Haley's column that you say, well, he might be the party's guy, but he stills an issue. Yeah, he needs these voters. It's a war shock test, right? It could be either one. If you're a pro Trump person, you say, look at this blowout. He basically swept her. She won DC with a tiny turnout in Vermont, a very blue state. Okay, whatever shrug it off, Trump's the dominant victor, right? That's the Trump line. Everyone get in line. We've got to unify. But if you're a hailey supporter or a Trump skeptical conservative or just someone looking at the electoral dynamics generally, you are pointing to those double digit areas in most of the states where Nikki Haley was, you know, let's say in the teens or in the 20s or in the 30s or in the 40s, right? Those are voters that are going to matter a lot in a general election. Even if you want to say, okay, well, a big chunk of them are Democrats, I think that's true to maybe a small extent. I don't think most of them are Democrats that's still a lot of recalcitrant, reticent center right voters that Republicans absolutely need to have in their column in November. So I think that's part of the point that she's been making. And I think that's something that the Trump campaign needs to keep in mind. And I think that that's sort of how this will shake out. I don't know which way they're going to go. I don't know how much unity is going to come of this. But I think that that's probably the point she's trying to make. Guy, turnout was low. I mean, the headlines I was reading from Maine, Arkansas, North Carolina, California, Massachusetts. Do we glean anything from that? Or does that just highlight, you know, what we've all been talking about? That the polling has indicated this lack of enthusiasm about this matchup. Or is there something maybe deeper going on here if the turnout was really as low as indicated? Well, I think it's interesting that the turnout in the South Carolina primary was high on the Republican side. It was abysmally low on the Democratic side. But on the Republican side, it was actually higher than it was in 2016 in a very contested cycle with many people fighting it out and still pretty early in the whole Trump phenomenon. You had a higher number of people turned out on the GOP side this time around. And I wonder if that was almost seen as like a last stand where Trump had swept the other early states. He had these commanding leads in most of the super Tuesday states based on polling. It was Nikki Haley's home state. So there was enough interest, ginned up to say, okay, if something is going to change, if there's going to be a shift in trajectory, let's see what happens in South Carolina. And there was this burst of more interest. And then Trump won by, you know, 20 points. And I think there was just at that point, a general sense among Trump's fans, among Trump's haters, detractors, whatever. Okay, this thing is basically over. And obviously in certain spots, I mean, if you look back to super Tuesday, especially in kind of well to do affluent suburban enclaves, Nikki Haley cleaned up. And Donald Trump and the Republicans generally have struggled in those areas in the last number of years. So that's something Republicans need to think about seriously looking ahead to November. But I think overall to your point about turnout, I just think there's just a sense in the country, even within the bases, we know what's going to happen. It's going to be Biden as the incumbent. Now it's going to be Trump. So there's less of an incentive for people to get out like not to throw them under the bus, but my own parents on super Tuesday, they live in one of the states. And I was on my way to the polling place in my state. And I said, oh, I'm going to go vote. They're like, oh, yeah, that's for us today too. We're just not going to bother. And they're, they're patrons who care about the country and they'll vote in the general election. But they just felt like this ball game is over. And they had other things to do on sort of a nasty, chilly, rainy day. I think that's probably some of what played out in a lot of people's minds. So I wouldn't read too deeply into it. I would say that there are some enthusiasm problems on the right with Trump, especially in some key areas. And then there are big enthusiasm problems for Biden on the Democratic side as well. Yeah. Let me get your thoughts before I let you go about the state of the union. Everyone seems to agree this was fiery political. But did he, did he make the case for himself on two friends politically, but also in terms of his health and his age is mental sharpness? You know, I tend to think, and I know this is sort of a hot take from someone whose job it is to comment on politics. But I tend to think that these things don't matter at all. We all talk about them what they matter immensely. And we chatter about them and pay great attention and break them down for a day or two. And then by next week, if you go back and you're like, okay, what was a big thing that he said? I think even people who watched it might draw a blank. And most Americans didn't watch it. So look, he made the case for himself. I think the goal was send him out there with a full head of steam, be as energetic as possible, pump him full of whatever he needs to be pumped full of to have that stamina, that excitement and all the adrenaline and the full pageantry of it all. And I mean, he was very shouty. He spoke very quickly. I think that he was trying to signal like, you know, look, I can do this. And because the Democrats have been so worried about him and the enthusiasm issue that I mentioned a moment ago has been so prevalent, I think for him to come out guns blazing in this very partisan. I mean, I think very inappropriately partisan way was a campaign speech, not a presidential one. That motivates the base that has been sort of underwhelmed and nervous, at least elements of it. And they all rushed out into social media, which is a terrible focus group, by the way, but they rushed onto social media to proclaim how great it was and how back he is and how all these concerns were put to bed. He got that phrase. He got that phrase. We're so excited. What a fabulous job. I think they're probably insisting this a little too hard, how thrilled they are. But I think they view it as like a kind of morale boost to shot in the arm. We'll see how long that lasts. I think a lot of Republicans, those who watched thought it was kind of a grotesque spectacle and reminded them why they can't stand Joe Biden. And as I said, leading up to the speech on TV, I said they shouldn't set the bar on the Republican side so low that if he doesn't fall over, right, and fall asleep at the podium, it's considered a success. Occasionally he can step up in prime time and relatively deliver when it comes to sharpness and that kind of thing. And he was fine. I mean, it wasn't great. I mean, it tailed off toward the end and he was slurring stuff, but that sort of Joe Biden. I think that you're seeing both sides spin it the way they want to. And my overall takeaway is I think it will make not a lot of difference at all, even in the relatively short term. Okay. Yeah, I think these things tend to accumulate, right? Like over time, like if you have a one off moment, fine, but if you keep seeing the person act a certain way of behavior, certain certain things, or if he has a big, yeah, if he has a big turn around, he's out there a lot and giving interviews and he's sharp and lucid and all of that, then maybe the narrative starts to change. But every day that passes, he gets a day older. We're going to have the special counsel testifying next week talking about that famous report and the memory problems and the infirmity that was described in that report in the White House won't release the transcripts, I think, telling me of that. So if there's another sort of flood or moment or stumble or what have you in the coming weeks, or they sort of hide him away, then the very calcified views of his age that really span partisanship. This is a broad consensus that he's too old. I think that will take hold again. But for now, it's like a little bit of a respite for the Democrats and they are going to milk it. The more I think about it, you know, because you give yourself that some time to think and you soak it up and you reflect, I was really struck now. I've decided by the idea that he started out the state of the union by telling us that he needs to wake us up like Roosevelt did ahead of World War II that not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today. And that if you think Putin will stop at Ukraine, he won't. The opening of the state of the union felt dark, even scary. And to hear that we need waking up, just like Americans did before a World War, you know, upon further reflection guy, I feel like a little alarmed. I get it. And I think it's hard, maybe to stomach that argument coming from a man whose staff generally limits his working hours for 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., right? But wake up America. Okay. If there's a, if there's a real urgency at the moment is this the person to lead us. Look, I think that what we saw over the last week, which is Donald Trump and his allies saying that Joe Biden is the worst president in American history, absolutely incompetent, ruining every major policy that he touches and also mentally and physically unfit for the job. And on the other hand, you have Joe Biden saying, this is one of the darkest hours for the country. And if we don't wake up, we're going to slide into, you know, fascism and authoritarianism and we could lose the country completely because Donald Trump and January 6th and all those things, democracy at stake, those big themes, which are extremely negative, those are going to be the dominant themes of these campaigns for the next eight months. So if it kind of made you feel dyspeptic and out of sorts and a little bit anxious, buckle up because you're going to get a very, very heavy dose of exactly that for the better part of the next year. Dispeptic, awesome. Thank you so much, Guy Vinson, for joining us. Appreciate it. No, I pleasure.

Head south west on Sanford Avenue, then turn left onto Donor Avenue. For those of you who know me from our weekly headline show, I'm Carmel Cremens and I live in Dublin. On a sunny afternoon, just ahead of St Patrick's Day, I'm driving up to Belfast in Northern Ireland. In the two-hour drive that separates the two cities, I see beautiful hills and the yellow flowers of the gorse shrubs that grow on the side of the road. What I don't see is a physical border. The only way you'd know you're actually in the United Kingdom are the road signs that switch from kilometers to miles. It's a symbol of the huge changes that have happened on this island and the conversations that are happening now about its future. And how for a new generation, Irish unity could become a long-term reality for those under British rule, but masks the tribalism that endures. In this special episode, I go beyond politics to try and understand what a new generation of voters in Northern Ireland wants. There's demographic trends, a bad face is on age-old sectarianism, and of course, the contrasting economic fortunes in two places split for more than 100 years. And then, because this is Ireland, there's music. I'm Carmel Kremens in Belfast. Belfast is a UNESCO city of music, and music is so important to Northern Ireland. Flute and pipe bands are defining part of the Protestant identity here, and the Fiddler and the Barrow will feature heavily in St Patrick's Day festivals north and sets of the border. So I started off by visiting a pipe band in the small village of Doge, about 10 miles north of Belfast. This is the major Sinclair Memorial pipe band. It's got over 40 Pipers and Drummers, and every week, some are all of them gather in a small village hall to practice. You're talking all ages, from kids right up to grandparents. The band prides itself on being cross-community, and will be marching in the St Patrick's Day parade in Belfast. Here's Glenn Baxter. He's a 24-year-old electrician, and one of the band's two pipe majors. The pipes will play along, you know, with myself, I went on the third of Belgium, you know, with the group from north on south, and we play along with the Boron, you know, playing Jackson Raiders. It is so common together, you know. Music is music, and you know, I think the politics is common and it. Honestly, I'd never heard anything like the sound of those pipes and drums. It was so powerful, so unbelievably loud, so I had to relocate my interviews outdoors, in the dark and the cold, which no one else seemed to mind. Except me, I was freezing. First up was Johnny Cousins. He's 24 years old and works as a cognitive behavioral therapist. And he's also an all-arlin solo, tenor drumming champion, twice over. Not bad for a guy who only took up drumming on his university gap year. So essentially, I burn myself on like a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday night, I haven't very much to do. Johnny twirled his drumsticks throughout our discussion, which reigned from music and religion to politics. And in particular, the ambition of Sinn Fein, the former political wing of guerrilla group, the Irish Republican Army, to unite Northern Ireland with the south. It was very difficult for a lot of unionists to kind of get on board with the principle of the United Ireland, which is being proposed by a party that for a lot of unionists is associated with a terrorist group. And so a lot of unionists will, a full-do unionists especially, will immediately be like, we're never going to vote for that. A lot of my generation of unionists from Protestant or else the Scots will say no because there's no plan, there's no idea of how we would integrate in terms of finances, in terms of NHS, or anything like that. And so without that plan in place, you would essentially be be voting for an idea rather than an actual concrete plan. Johnny spoke about the need to protect the Ulster Scots identity of a lot of pro-union voters. His bandmate, Hannah Thompson, agreed. She's a PhD student in environmental science and a veteran pipe role ready at the age of 23. She described herself as coming from a unionist Protestant background, but identity can be complicated, like the time she traveled to Romania with a pipe band from County Dunning Hall. When you're in the grass somewhere, that's not home. I didn't really have an issue, been called Irish. It was all the time that you're the Irish pipe person, yeah? And how would you describe yourself here when you're home? Oh, I'm Northern Irish. I don't ask for my identity, I'd always go Northern Irish. And then, British is a second. Like Johnny, she could foresee a border pole being held in the future. And economics and identity would play a big role in deciding how to vote. I think it's difficult to not vote for, you know, what she identifies as. I would also look at the pros and cons of an over-situation at the time. I wouldn't, I would look at it with a sensible head, if it would be smarter to stay believe I would consider pros and cons. Yeah. But again, you'd have to kind of separate yourself in a way of your identity, but again, it would be difficult to kind of remove yourself and think, you know, this side, I don't buy. I see myself, you know, in the future, in a place where I don't really identify being from. Yeah. I don't know what would be difficult. Sinn Fein leader Mary Lume McDonald says the United Ireland is within touching distance. There's a conversation underway about what happens next 25 years. 26 years almost on from the Good Friday. The agreement what does Ireland look like in five years time, in ten years time, in a generation's time. The days of partition are numbered. It doesn't work. But is that really the case? To find out, I spoke to our Belfast correspondent Amanda Ferguson. She's been covering the twists and turns of what goes on in Northern Ireland for 15 years. We met in the grand setting of Belfast City Hall, where they were setting up for an event to mark International Women's Day. The Good Friday agreement is clear that for now, Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom, but it is a conditional part of the United Kingdom. So the only way that that would change would be if people vote for it in a border pool. Now, it would be up to the UK government secretary of state for Northern Ireland to call a border pool. He could do that in any circumstances, but the most likely one is if he is of the view that the majority of people would want to vote for a United Ireland. And then the pool would be called up to this point the UK government has resisted outlining the conditions that would need to be met for a border pool to be called. So politicians everywhere feast on surveys and polls. But here, it must be, you know, it's existential. What we have seen is to be very sort of blunt about it, and it's not precise. We're kind of dividing along 40, 40, 20 lines. So 40% of the population, roughly, it's from a British Unionist tradition. 40% is roughly what will be described as an Irish Republican or nationalist background. And then the other 20 is made up of what are known as the others. Now, the others as they're described would vote for parties like the Alliance Party and the Green Party who don't take a fixed constitutional position. But within the support base for both of those parties, you will have people who are British Unionists and Irish Republicans, people who could be persuaded either way whenever it comes to a referendum, whenever it comes to border pool day. Some people who don't really care about it at all, that it doesn't exercise them. It's not something that motivates them. And that is the cohort that everybody will be trying to court whenever it comes to a border pool because everybody has kind of knows what they want. Whereas that group is a little bit ambiguous, so they'll be extremely important on the decision day, I guess. Is it a basic question of demographics or is it not as simple as that? When you look at a different chart that showed you who is most in favor of Irish unity, the over 65s are less in favor of it and the young voters here at 10 are very keen on that idea. So we know what happens to people as they age, they vanish from statistics and those young people who have become voters. So it depends, I guess, you can't just assume because someone's from a particular background that they're going to vote a certain way because they want to know what's happening with the health service, some of the education and infrastructure, and how it would make a difference to pensions. And a whole range of different issues. Amanda's right, you can't assume from someone's background the way they're going to vote. On a Wednesday evening in the Crown and Shamrock pub north of Belfast, you'll often find traditional Irish musicians having a session. Pines of Guinness on the table, eyes closed as they concentrate on the tunes. There's a nice cozy vibe and a sign which I'm taking to be tongue in cheek, warning against discussions of politics and religion. I take the plunge anyway. Owen Nugent is an 18 year old student at Queen's University studying philosophy, politics and economics. He plays the fiddle, considers himself Irish, and would like a united Ireland in what he describes as the not too distant future. I agree. I'd certainly vote. Yes, that's just the way I'm inclined to understand a lot of people would be on the fence and that sort of thing. And maybe just they they're not too sure as to what they'd see as to what to expect. So in that sense, it's just more comfortable for some people to vote for the status quo. I suppose broader nationalism has to ask itself is what do you do to then make the south more appealing than in the sorts of like social services and institutions? They'd have to be more appealing to persuade Michael Lawrenceson. He's a 32 year old geography teacher and not interested in identity politics. But if someone wants to say to you, well what's your nationality? I just kind of go whatever, you know, I'm one of those people and nice and nice is not a quite socialist. Yes. He's more interested in the quality of life. And it's that rather than the flag or the national anthem that will be a deciding factor in any future referendum. I think it's an interesting one because I couldn't say yes for no reason because it's a ridiculous question. What does the United States look like? Is it a national house? It's a national house. I can't speak house service. Is it public sector, mass investment, public sector? It's intel going to pay more tax than so if there's Google going to pay tax. If there's not, why would I be interested in my livelihood? My quality of life isn't going to improve. But I would like social change. If I put that both in the Republic of Ireland or Northern UK, there needs to be massive investment, public sector, in renewables, nationalizing energy, all this health service public, you know, all that stuff is way more important than what country I come from. Michael Lawrenceson is the type of voter that Amanda describes as the 20%. So how are local politicians thinking about a referendum? I'm in the town of Balamina, famous for being the birthplace of Hollywood actor Liam Neeson. Ian Paisley Jr. is a Democratic Unionist party MP there. His late father, Ian Paisley Sr. was a firebrand Protestant preacher and hardline ulster unionist. Paisley Sr. was so opposed to closer ties to the Irish Republic that he was known as Dr. No. But he later said yes to sharing power with his once mortal enemies. Large pictures of Paisley Sr. lined the walls in his son's constituency office. I started off by asking him if he thought there'd be a referendum on Irish unity. I think the border, the issue of the border has always been on the horizon since Northern Ireland, was created as a state. The issues will have actually ever taken place. I have in the few the fact that nationalism and republicanism, which is supposed to be driving the issue of the border, keep kicking it off for 10 years every time, suggests to me that they know it's never actually a political change. See, you don't think there will be a border fall? No, do not. And even if there is, I still think that all of the stats show that ultimately Northern Ireland is better placed to remain within the United Kingdom, because much more stable within the United Kingdom. I also think there's a huge psychological problem, actually, just here and it's... Look, the problem of Northern Ireland is that you've got people who are divided, people of Northern Ireland are one unit. Yes, they're Catholic and Protestant and I don't know either, or non-religiously don't they? They're unisoned, non-sense, or unisoned republican and they're outlook, but they are a people and they are divided. The idea that you have a border Poland, move those people from one jurisdiction into a jurisdiction called all Ireland, doesn't solve the fact that the people are still divided. It's healing the divisions within the people of Northern Ireland that I'm more interested in than actually focusing on what they should be part of the United Kingdom and should be part of the Irish Republic. That actually doesn't affect the problem. And the problem is that people need to heal that division. I've been hearing a lot about the other, you know, the grouping of people in the voters who aren't identifying one way or the other. Are you actively reaching out to the other? I hope that the status quo pays as much to them as a force to, unions who are big unionists and probably those to a large degree. I also, I'm not saying I'm skeptical about this other community called the other, because you're scouts of service in Northern Ireland of everyone on their tribal. And anyone who says here, I'm above that, really, I'm really above that, you know, come on. You scouts of service, everyone is in some way a tribal. And I'm not saying that they're sectarian on that. I'm just saying that's just the nature of the nation, the country that we've grown up on. And even families that are mixed and integrated and all the rest of the stories is tribal view within them. John Fannouken, a member of Parliament for Belfast North, disagrees. Like all Shinfhen politicians, he refuses to sit or vote in the Westminster Parliament. His father, Pat Fannouken, was a human rights lawyer who was shot dead in front of his family in 1989 by pro-British militants. A picture of Pat Fannouken hangs in the corner of his son's law firm in Belfast City Centre. I start off with the most obvious question. So for Shinfhen for yourselves, when would you like to hold a border pole? Well, I think that we are in what we have described as a decade of opportunity. I think it's inevitable that a border pole will be put before the people of Ireland, North and South. This is not about me saying that I want a border pole tomorrow morning. I want a border pole exactly this time next year. That would be reckless. Brexit is the blueprint as to how you not to do these things. So for somebody who advocates for constitutional change, I will extend that by saying I advocate for constitutional change in an orderly, in a mature and an informed fashion. And that's why there needs to be a recognition, particularly from an Irish government, that we need to join this debate in a way that only a sovereign government can't. The opinion polling without any real interaction and engagement from an Irish government, I think, is very healthy. I think once this debate is resourced even more, then we will see that momentum continue. There is that other, the group, the other that I've been hearing a lot about. I find that for people who at the very least want to be part of the conversation and haven't made their mind up yet, I find that I find that I tend to drift more towards health, it drift towards the economy, it drift towards my pensions. What is this new art and look like for my children and my grandchildren? So I think there is a rule for everybody in this conversation on this. So political parties, civic society, academia, different sectors within society, and by and large, all of those different people in areas are stepping up and playing the role. No one person or party, particularly Sinn Fein, owns this conversation. This is a conversation that belongs to everybody, and that's important to say. But there comes a point where only a government has the ability to bring it to the next stage. And we are at that point now where it needs brought to the next stage. So the Irish government have a huge obligation and responsibility in that regard, but also so do the British government. So what is Dublin doing? Do the people and the politicians want to unite with the North? Porik Halpin has been running Reuters coverage of Ireland for the last 10 years and knows his way well around the political corridors of power. But equally, they've been pretty consistent that they don't see it in the near term. And that's that's cited as the main reason why, main reason why they are looking to do any, any sort of planning. I think they also see it as a device of politically at the moment when things are just getting back under feet in Northern Ireland regarding politics there. So we're expecting a general election in Ireland sometime in the next 12 months. If Sinn Fein gets into government, how might that change an Irish government's approach to possible unification? Yes, it could change quite a lot. Sinn Fein's reason for being is, I noted Ireland, they're the clear favorites to lead the next government when election happens in the next 12 months. They want planning to begin an earnest. They wanted via parliamentary committees. They want a citizens assembly to discuss those kind of more difficult issues like a flag and a national anthem. Issues that Sinn Fein themselves haven't really, haven't really just discussed in any great way. And now if they're leading the next government, it will be part of a coalition, but the dynamic would certainly change. I think that kind of planning would be the price of Sinn Fein leading that government. So if the polls are correct and Sinn Fein commit on top of the next election kind of form of government, that dynamic is going to change. How do people in the Republic feel about a potential border poll? So the survey say they're in favor of us and in favor in pretty big numbers. It was a comprehensive poll before Christmas that showed 64% in favor just 16% against the United Ireland. The rest are in the unknown camp. Interestingly, that survey looked and asked questions around flagged, around a new anthem, around possible changes to the Irish constitution. And voters were much more, were split much more evenly on those issues. I think that goes to show that they're not those kind of issues aren't really been discussed. They're not on people's radar. So I think while there's a big majority in favor, I think people haven't really thought about it beyond that surface idea. Speaking to people in Northern Ireland, they are worried about the financial ramifications if there was to be unification. Can the Republic afford it? The headline level Britain subsidises Northern Ireland to the tune of 14 billion pounds each year for that very public service focused economy. While Ireland is one of the few European countries running a budget service at the moment and quite a significant one of that, we was about half the level last year that the UK subsidises Northern Ireland. But Ireland is in a much, much better position to consider this question. Those healthy public finances, Dublin is hoping to turn into a sovereign wealth fund that could reach 100 billion euros within a decade. That's driven by these huge amounts of corporate tax from the multi national focus economy down in Dublin. So on that headline level, Ireland potentially could be in a position to consider it. But back to the point of no planning happening, those discussions on what would happen or how what the health service would look like. I will be funded those questions around pensions, those kind of things just like having been discussed at all. So you can only really look at things on a headline level, I guess. What's the British government's position on all of this? So the UK's Northern Ireland minister said recently that he doesn't see a referendum happening in his lifetime. And with polls consistently showing that a fairly clear majority of people in Northern Ireland would vote for the status quo if a poll was held tomorrow. London can simply say and they do that the conditions for holding a referendum are nowhere near being met. Interestingly, the Labour leader, Kirsta Armer, said something very similar before the Labour Party conference last year. And he described it as a hypothetical situation. And again, that the conditions aren't near being met. So I think until you see opinion polls that are much closer or certainly some going the other way, that will continue to be London's position, I think.

This is what's news Sunday, the show where we tackle the big questions about the biggest stories in the news. We reach out to our colleagues across the newsroom to help explain what's happening in our world. This week, we're answering your questions about how social media is affecting kids. What platforms are doing to limit known harms for young people's mental health, and whether the government needs to intervene, and if so, how. You ready? Let's get right to it. When we asked you to share your concerns about social media's influence on kids, we heard back about a wide array of issues, from bullying and constant screen time to the formation of potentially addictive habits. And add to that, reporting on how social media can worsen teens' body image, make them targets of sexual harassment, and increase their exposure to content related to self-harm and racism, and it can feel overwhelming to parents to consider what ought to be done to make social media a safer place. Social media companies, including Meta and TikTok, have said they're committed to making sure their platforms are safe for kids. Meta told us it wants to help teens have safe, positive experiences on its apps. TikTok, X, and Apple did not respond to our requests for comment. As for government regulation, that is on the table. More on that later. But first, I'm joined by Julie Jargon, the journal's family and tech columnist, and reporter Jeff Horwitz, who covers Meta and led coverage of the award-winning Facebook files investigation. Jeff at a Senate hearing in January met a CEO Mark Zuckerberg, said the following. Mental health is a complex issue, and the existing body of scientific work has not shown a cause-a-link between using social media and young people having more mental health outcomes. Jeff, that comes after the US Surgeon General last year issued a public advisory warning about social media's risks for young people, citing this growing body of research on the detrimental effects for adolescents amid a national youth mental health crisis. So, to what extent are social media companies aware of those concerns? So, while I can't speak for everyone, there is unquestionably a large body of publicly available research outlining some of these issues, and then the stuff that we have obtained from inside Meta Facebook and Instagram research into things like notifications that, you know, Meta would sort of send. Basically, if they hadn't been checking the app enough per Meta's sensibility, those things were sort of geared toward increasing a fear of missing out and of kind of side-tracking kids from what they've been doing. And then there's also things, and the body image front as well, they did a lot of research into beauty filters, which the research found was bad for both the people posting them because they knew they didn't actually look like their online persona, and also bad for the people who saw them, because they definitely didn't look like the enhanced image of the people they were viewing. In terms of the techniques, Jeff, that social media companies use to drive engagement, you talked about systems built to maximize attention, to trigger FOMO, and I want to play a question that we received from one of our listeners, Mateo Guillemont. Here it is. Given that we've seen the research shows they're using addictive strategies to hook miners onto their platforms, you can consider these companies almost like gaming companies as a casino, for example, or online betting platform. Jeff, I should note, Mateo goes on to ask about regulation, but just on that claim about the use of addictive strategies to hook miners. Is that something that has been proven? The platforms themselves have been by their own acknowledgement, designing products to be stickier to involve people spending more time on them, and that is going to definitely involve some of the same interactions and dopamine rewards that slot machines provide, right? The analogy is not a bad one. It's actually part of a multi-state lawsuit claiming that meta designed its products to capitalize on how young users, brains, work, meta told us it doesn't design its products to be stickier and to encourage users to spend more time on them. Nevertheless, social media does have an impact, something you usually have reported on extensively. What has jumped out to you in the course of your reporting about how all of this is impacting families? Well, I think in terms of families, the major concern is that parents feel fairly helpless here. They feel like they're competing against an algorithm that is more efficient and effective than they are in shaping their children's online behavior. And they don't know how to get around that, short of not allowing their children to be on any of these platforms at all. So, once the kids are on social media, they're at a loss to figure out how to limit the time that they spend on these platforms and also restrict the type of content that they're seeing. It can be very confusing for parents to understand what an algorithm is showing their kids, and even though there are tools that the social media companies have developed to try to assist with this, it could be very cumbersome to set up. And of course, nothing is foolproof, and kids can find workarounds to anything parents do anyway. And on what Julie said there just to follow up, a lot of platforms make a big deal about the parental controls. It's true they exist, and they should exist. That said, the widely understood secret inside of most of the companies is that the idea that even the most helicoptering parent is going to be able to keep track of their child's digital footprint is fairly implausible. Julie, let me follow up on that because we heard from a listener, Nathan Beechy, who had this question about tools out there to help kids and really anyone control their experience on social media. Let's play that. I was wondering if there'd be a way for social media companies to use screen limiters or timers to enforce that individuals couldn't be on their platform for more than certain time each day. When you're reporting, you've referred to these types of tools when they're used to regulate children's time on social media as childproofing tools. Just remind us if you could what tools are out there and if they're considered safe. Well, the social media platforms themselves do have a number of tools, some of which can limit the amount of time. Kids spend on them, some are more in the lines of sort of content filtering where you can go in and pick certain hashtags that would be contained in videos that you might not want your child to see. They have a lot of tools that are not necessarily inherently bad, but like Jeff was saying, they're hard to use. They're hidden in the settings. They're not intuitive. And you're talking about several different social media apps that your kids might have across different devices. Then there are also device level settings that parents can use such as on Apple devices. And those have not worked very well either. Everett and about Apple's screen time settings, which allow parents to set time limits for their kids and do some other filtering. And there have been sinking problems across the parents devices and their kids devices that have made those settings come undone. So there's no certainty that parents can have that anything that they set up either sticks or that their kids can't find workarounds to. And Apple has said it will continue to make updates and improve that situation. Meta says that it's added 30 different tools and features to help parents and teens. But Julie, beyond these types of tools, what else are our social media companies doing in response to many of the concerns we've been talking about here? One of the recent moves that Meta has taken with Instagram is that they are going to automatically filter certain types of content from teen accounts. So certain body image related, like eating disorder related content, graphic violence, things like that. They're going to filter from getting to teen accounts. And again, teens can get around that if they feel like they're not seeing the stuff they used to see on their feeds. They can create a different account. They can lie about their age. And that gets into all of the kind of the big picture questions about how do you regulate this? For their part, social media companies like Meta, Jeff, have indicated they would like the government to take the lead on any regulations. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Senators at a hearing in January, he supports quote, setting industry standards on age, appropriate content. But Jeff, beyond what we've been discussing here, are there additional steps that social media companies could take if they wish to? Oh, vastly. There are steps that could be taken here. Look, this stuff wasn't designed for what parents would want. Or even what teens necessarily would want if you asked them. It was designed for the benefit of the companies. So a few things that definitely could be considered. First one is just what level of contact with the outside world you want to have. Do you want kids trying to go viral and being reached by basically anyone in the world? That is a product design choice. There's the question of what type of content gets recommended. And if you're doing it without much of an idea of what actually is being pushed. I mean, Julie mentioned the goal of not recommending awful things to kids. But the systems inside these companies are not good enough to reliably do that. There are a bunch of ways that you could make the product something that most parents would probably be more comfortable with. But it also would not be as good for usage of these products. And that's something that it's very hard to imagine the company is wanting to undertake voluntarily. Reporter Jeff Horowitz covers meta and social media platforms for us. Jeff, Julie, thank you both so much. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Coming up, we'll shift this conversation to Washington to see how lawmakers are approaching potential regulations around kids and social media with the Brookings institutions Nicole Turner Lee. That's after a short break. Hey, what's news fans? Listen up. That's right. But that's not all. So we know they definitely have something for you. And it's already included in your prime membership. That's Amazon.com slash what's news. It's just that easy. Well, we've heard your concerns now about how social media is affecting children and some of what social media companies are or aren't doing to address those issues. But what about the role of regulators and lawmakers? Current federal legislation protects children's personal information lays out rules for what you can or cannot do online and sets out some expectations for how companies handle data. But that said, most of these laws were implemented before the proliferation of social media we see today. Nicole Turner Lee is the director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the nonprofit Brookings Institution where she steers research on tech policymaking. Nicole, we are going to talk about the potential for new legislation regulating social media. Many of these companies have said that they want the government to craft regulations. Is that something lawmakers could actually look to do? There's a general understanding today and quite obvious among some of the previous legislation that a threshold of a minor at 13 and under is basically one that most people buy into. The challenge is without age assurance a 13 year old could be online on a site that is designed for an 18 year old. There have been calls to sort of raise the age limit to 16. Like my daughter says it's like the driving limit of online platforms, right? But the challenge with the online space is that somebody has to verify that, right? There's going to be a parent that's going to be able to come on over and say, oh yeah, baby, let me push this button for you because you are at the right age. We're finding that that's not the case. There's some legislation that is suggesting we should have documentation. And then there's another interesting discussion that sort of has entered the stage here, which are young people who are going to the internet for protection and safety. Young people from the LGBTQ community who may not have told their parents that they're out but yet are going online to find a comfort group, trans kids. You know, these are like real issues which suggest to me this is not your grandmother's family household anymore, right? Not at all. And we actually heard from one listener Nicole Jordan who is wrestling with a very contemporary concern, wanting her kids to be tech savvy but also not exposed to content that would keep them glued to their screens. She told us that her soon to be 11 year old could soon get a paired down cell phone that doesn't include the internet or other apps. And there are a lot of companies out there making devices like this. Could there be something similar for social media? Well, I mean, here's the deal. When I was younger, my mother told me I couldn't listen to certain records and I still did. You know, we can get away with scaled down technology with our toddlers. I'm not sure if we can get away with that when we start dealing with our adolescents. We once did a podcast at Brookings where we bought young people on one of them, which was my daughter. And we asked them like, who's responsible for this? Do parents need to do more? Do we need to scale it down? And essentially they said we spend most of our high school education learning how to drive, but we don't learn about media. We don't have the digital literacy training. We won't give people the tools that they need to properly engage. And more importantly, we may actually intrude on children's rights. They're right to be able to be creative and ideate and other things that comes with these new technologies. Alright, so more education, more awareness needed here, but just going back to what you said earlier. If you can't regulate kids usage of the record playher or in this case, social media, how much can really be done here? We had one listener, Zoe Butler, Colin wondering what is actually politically feasible? I'm skeptical about bipartisan support for regulating social media for teens. I want to know the ways that these pieces of legislation play into the larger appetite for regulating big tech and social media algorithms. Nicole, be honest with us is bipartisan regulation on social media for children realistically within reach now. I mean, I think the ecosystem in which we have now when it comes to tech policy is still pretty disparate. We have various agencies asserting jurisdiction over parts of the ecosystem. You know, I think there is possibly more interest in children's privacy, believe it or not, than we're actually acknowledging. We've seen several bipartisan bills hit the floor. If we really want to hit children's privacy, we've got to hit privacy in general. Compared to the EU, the United States doesn't have a comprehensive data privacy standard. And that then allows for a wild west in terms of what can be collected on people in general. We do need to look at our outdated children's privacy laws, some of the things that are already pre-existing, and see if they actually function well in a 21st century economy. My point is, legislators can do something, the challenge that we have, and the Congress that we have, it's still under term in what they will do. Nicole Turnerley is the director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Nonprofit Brookings Institution. Nicole, thank you so much for taking on these big questions with us. Thank you so much and I'm glad we got through it because these are really difficult questions. And that's it for what's new Sunday for March 3rd. Today's show was produced by Charlotte Gartenberg with supervising producer Sandra Kylhoff.

Thanks for listening.\",\"The State of New York could move to seize Donald Trump's assets today, as the former president runs out of time to dodge a $454 million penalty. Plus, Russia reckons with one of its deadliest terror attacks in decades. What this does is put anti-terrorism efforts right, back, front and center in terms of what not just Russia has to be thinking about, but Europe as well. And CEO pay rides the stock market wave. It's Monday, March 25th. Former president Donald Trump has failed to come up with the $454 million needed to cover a judgment against him in a New York civil fraud case. And with his grace period running out today, the state could now move to seize his assets. Trump failed to get a court to put the penalty on pause while he continues to challenge the ruling, and his legal team has said that securing a bond to cover it was \\\"virtually impossible.\\\" State Attorney General Letitia James, who originally brought the fraud case, has already laid some of the groundwork to seize some of Trump's assets, registering a judgment in Westchester County, the location of one of Trump's properties. Such moves could put in jeopardy the marquee buildings and golf courses on which Trump built his reputation. Though James could also seek to seize Trump's accounts at financial institutions. Well, in case you missed it, the US managed to avoid a government shutdown over the weekend after the Senate approved a $1.2 trillion funding package that President Biden was quick to sign into law. After months of congressional drama, leaders in both parties described scoring wins in negotiations with Democrats saying they had fended off cuts to education, labor, and health programs, while Republicans said they had successfully reduced spending on foreign aid and nonprofit groups that helped migrants as well as clawing back funding from the IRS. However, the bipartisan coalition that speaker, Mike Johnson, relied on to push the spending package over the finish line could soon face a fresh test with the House expected to take on long stalled legislation to fund Ukraine and Israel that enjoys broad support on both sides of the aisle, but which many Republicans staunchly oppose. Meanwhile, senior Israeli officials are due to visit Washington in the coming days to present their plans for continuing the fight against Hamas in Gaza. The Biden Administration is hoping to persuade the delegation to avoid a full ground invasion of the crowded border City of Rafah. However, prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears set on the idea and has said that Israel would press ahead with or without US support. Correspondent, Dov Lieber, in Tel Aviv has the latestDov Lieber: With Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, in Washington this week. What we need to look out for is whether there'll be some kind of proposal from the American side that the Israelis will find suitable for their needs in Rafah. There are thousands of militants in Rafah that Israel wants to arrest, kill, or capture, and at the same time, it wants to have some kind of control over the border between the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip. And the Israelis think that they need a very large operation to get it done. The Americans are looking for something a little more tactical, and it's a major question whether this can be bridged between them. Russia is continuing to mourn the deaths of over 130 people who were killed Friday at a concert hall near Moscow in the deadliest episode of terrorism in the country in decades. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the assault and assessment backed up by the United States. But within Russia, the official line is more complicated as President Vladimir Putin seeks to connect the attack to Ukraine. Journal correspondent, Thomas Grove, has been monitoring the response to Friday's attack. Thomas, bring us up to speed. What do we know about what occurred on Friday several days on now? The attack started out with gunmen entering the foyer of the Crocus City Hall and shooting straight into the crowd really. A fire was unleashed from various smoke bombs and lighter fluid, and the place went up like a match, unfortunately. The very night of the attack, there were four suspects who were caught in Bryansk region which abuts Belarus and Ukraine. So now we are four days later, rescue teams are still sifting through the rubble. Looking for the bodies now of people who are maybe under there. In terms of who was responsible for this, Thomas, what has Russia had to say? I think Russia is not entirely clear as to how to present this attack. First and foremost, it was warned almost two weeks in advance about this attack by the United States, and it was publicly dismissed by Vladimir Putin the very week of the attack. And so this obviously points to major security blunders on the part of the Russian authorities. So the day after the attack, Putin came out on state television and said that this was an attack that was perhaps not orchestrated by... He didn't blame Ukraine directly, but he said that there was preliminary evidence that said that Ukraine was giving the attackers room to enter into Ukraine. We should note, Thomas, that Putin offered no evidence to back up that assertion and Ukraine has denied any involvement in the attack. Western governments, meanwhile, have also rejected those accusations, calling them malicious propaganda. Turning to the Islamic State here though, they have claimed responsibility for the attack, a claim backed up by the US, which has pinned the blame on a branch of the group based in Afghanistan known as ISI-K. What significance would that have? Why would they be targeting Russia? ISIS-K is an interesting organization in the sense that it conflates a lot of the regional animus towards Russia in one group. You have people that came into ISIS from Chechnya, from the North Caucasus, which had a long-running conflict with Russia on its own territory. You have central Asians that feel as though Moscow has been this overlord in the region as the root of all evil. And then you have just other Islamist groups as well that feel as though Russia as a Christian orthodox country that believes in traditional values and Putin makes no secret of his religiosity. And Moscow is just as much of a target as Germany is or the United States would be or other countries seen as Christian and Western. For a broader audience outside of Russia, does this also mean we should now be paying more attention to the Islamic state? They were highly in focus several years ago, but it sort of slipped off the radar a little bit. I think with the rise of Russia and China, a lot of our security positioning has been focused on great power competition. And so I think what this does is put anti-terrorism efforts right back front and center in terms of what, not just Russia has to be thinking about, but Europe as well. ISIS-K was also trying to launch attacks in Germany, for example. So it's not just Russia that's in the crosshairs here, it's broadly the west. Yeah. We have previously reported Thomas that European security agencies have thwarted several plots by Islamic state in recent months. It just begs the question, what should we be watching for next, Thomas, both within Russia and more broadly? Well, I think first and foremost, we have to think about Paris and the Olympics coming up. And this is a huge event and a lot of attention is going to be paid to it, not just by media organizations like ourselves, but also organizations like ISIS-K. And inside Russia, this attack has echoes of previous attacks that we've seen in the late 1990s and throughout the 2000s. Those attacks strengthened Putin's hand and we saw a subsequent crackdown on society following them. I think what we could see this time around is something very similar, possibly another crackdown on the few remnants of civil society and civic liberties that Russians still have. And on top of it, if Russia tries to link this more tightly with Ukraine, it wouldn't be difficult to see another mass mobilization or further moves that could try to strengthen Russia's position on the battlefield. Thomas, thank you so much for the update. Sure, thank you. Coming up, CEOs cash in after last year's stock market rally and we've got a bitter update on commodity prices. That's after the break. Last year, chipmaker, Broadcom, awarded its Chief Executive Hock Tan with a $161 million stock award, instantly landing him among the highest paid CEOs. But now that award could swell to $1.3 billion thanks to a surge in the company's share price. The gains are revealed, thanks to new rules requiring companies to disclose how much executives equity awards changed in value during the year. And WSJ Europe finance reporter, Patricia Kowsmann, said tan is not an exception among CEOs in seeing a surge in the value of their pay packages. If you remember last year, the stock market did really well. So the S&P 500 index, for example, it gained 24%. And if you think about the biggest gainers, there are a lot of technology companies. Overall, an analysis that the Journal did found that pay for the top executives at 187 S&P 500 companies race towards a new high year rebounding from a bit of a sluggish growth in 2022 because the stock markets didn't do very well. And we'll have a lot more on executive compensation later in the spring when the journal publishes a full ranking of S&P 500 CEO pay. And while we're all used to CEOs getting paid, what about college athletes? The March Madness Basketball Tournament is in high gear, and increasingly so too is a unionization push in college athletics led by students at Dartmouth. And we want to know what questions you have about how that could reshape everything from the future of American higher education to professional sports. So send us a note or even better record a voice memo on your phone and send that to us at WNpod@wsj.com. That's WNpod@wsj.com. Or leave us a voicemail at 212-416-4328. Just be sure to include your name and location because we might use it on the show. And finally, your sweet tooth might start costing you more than usual as the price of cocoa reaches new records. Chocolate's main ingredient has gotten more expensive, thanks to extreme weather with the El Nino phenomenon, bringing unusually wet conditions and strong winds to West Africa that combined to cause severe crop shortages. Cocoa prices ended last week, a whopping 42% above the previous record set in 1977, and our commodities reporter, Ryan Dezember, has more. Demand is still rising. While this year's crop is so much lower, which is going to eat into the world supplies, companies that make chocolate or use a lot of chocolate in their recipes, they're going to probably have to manage through this with higher prices. Big companies, Hershey's, Mondelez, they're all telling their investors this is going to be a problem for us going forward, and could it eat into profits a little bit. The companies that really rely on chocolate, stock market analysts are saying, watch out for their shares because they're going to be needing to raise prices and continue what we call shrinkflation. And that's What's News for Monday morning. Today's show was produced by Hattie Moir and Kate Bullivant. Cristina Roca was our supervising producer. We will be back tonight with a new show. And until then, thanks for listening. Donald Trump can post a smaller bond, $175 million in a New York civil fraud case. And, US teacher salaries have stayed flat for decades and many are leaving the field. A lot of other professionals, nurses, architects, lawyers, of course engineers, accountants, college professors, are all better paid, have better salaries at least than teachers, and so teachers feel frustrated by that. Plus, Boeing's CEO is stepping down as part of a broader executive shakeup. It's Monday, March 25th. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. Over the past few weeks, we've been covering the fallout at Boeing after a January mid-air blowout on a 737 MAX jet and ongoing production problems at the plane maker. Today, CEO Dave Calhoun announced he's stepping down at the end of the year. Calhoun had been planning to step aside, but frustration from airlines and regulators sped up his announcement and led to a broader executive shakeup. Boeing's commercial aircraft business head will step aside immediately and the company's chairman won't stand for reelection. Steve Mollenkopf, a former CEO of Qualcomm will take over as board chair and lead the search for the next Boeing boss. According to people familiar with the matter, Boeing's board met over the weekend and decided to address the company's leadership plans ahead of a meeting requested by a group of airline CEOs. Welcome back, Jon. Hello. Calhoun came aboard at Boeing during another crisis and he had promised to turn the company around. So what went wrong here? What were Calhoun and the other leaders involved in this shakeup not able to accomplish? It's been a long time coming that this more shareholder centric value culture has permeated Boeing. People talk about it starting in the late '90s. It was hard for him to manage to do this quickly without angering people, but I would say that maybe the issue is that he didn't go far enough. Boeing has always tried to tinker at the edges, first by not immediately replacing the previous CEO. Then by having Caloun come on board. We have to remember that Caloun himself is an insider, that he'd been at the company at the board since 2009. So Boeing didn't do a clean break. That's just the reality of it. Many of us thought maybe they didn't need to. Maybe they could just fix the current problem, it would be enough, but it seems like this culture of bad quality control and bad execution even on some good ideas that they have is just everywhere and they try and do a little bit, but it keeps blowing up at other places. As Boeing searches for new leadership now, what does the company need to do to satisfy critics and investors? It's a good question, because again, these are difficult things to do and we saw when Dave Caloun said, \\\"Well, if there's any issues, we'll stop reduction,\\\" right? What we see with that is that of course, airlines and lessors, they're not very happy when that happens. So there is this trade off between, \\\"No, we will get quality control back in check.\\\" But also doing that might also anger people. So it's one of those difficult things. And I think ultimately what they need is this notion of credibility, this notion that the new Boeing really is happening and that things are looking up rather than there will be another big scandal around the corner. And it's very hard to know who can do that. My impression is that though the instinct of these companies is often to go to an insider, and we have this possibility here as well, if you get someone from the outside that can really communicate the message that things are changing and that he will go as far as necessary, maybe that will give the new boss the necessary room to sometimes anger someone but say, \\\"No, we're doing this for good reason. And you will see how when I'm done here, all of these problems, they will be a thing of the past.\\\" A New York appellate court has ruled that Donald Trump needs to pay just $175 million to put his $454 million civil fraud judgment on hold during his appeal. While Trump only needs to pay a fraction of the civil judgment for now, he could still be on the hook for the full amount if he loses the appeal. The last minute reprieve came on the day New York's Attorney General Letitia James could start enforcing the judgment. Trump's legal team had said it was virtually impossible to secure a bond to cover the entire amount. Trump now has 10 days to post a bond or pay cash to cover the 175 million. Meanwhile, a New York judge has said an April 15th trial date in a separate criminal case against Trump on charges of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election. Trump has denied wrongdoing. Where in the midst of basketball's March Madness. And this year it comes as there's a new push focusing on unionization in sports, most recently at Dartmouth. There's a lot of opinions on all sides of this debate. And we'd like to hear from you, our listeners. What questions do you have about the unionization push? And what it means for colleges, athletes, and sports overall. Send us a note. Or even better, record a voice memo on your phone and send it to wnpod@wsj.com. That's wnpod@wsj.com.

Coming up, US teacher pay hasn't increased in three decades. How new legislation could change that, after the break. Many people, including politicians, have been advocating for higher wages for teachers. President Biden even mentioned it during his State of the Union address earlier this month. But the reality is, teacher pay has stalled for three decades. It's about the same, adjusted for inflation of course as it was back in 1990, about $66,400. Even though states are putting more money into public schools, the funding has gone toward more staff, rising healthcare costs, and pensions, not teacher salaries. Now, some states are looking at making pay raises mandatory. Welcome to What's News, Matt. Thanks for having me. Matt, teacher pay has stayed flat for decades. How is that playing out in classrooms across the country right now? Well, we would worry that flat pay is going to make it harder to recruit and retain teachers. Now, there's a question of how strong the evidence is for that, but economic theory would predict when other college educated professions are more attractive and pay is going up there, that more teachers are going to be leaving the classroom and fewer people are going to be entering teaching. And that's exactly what we see. We've seen in the last couple of years a pretty significant spike in the number of people leaving teaching. Now, I should say that's only the last couple of years and this pay trend has been going on for decades as we've discussed. So it's not clear if that's what's driving it, but we do see more teachers leaving. And we have seen a longer term decrease in the number of people wanting to become teachers, and some of that could be due to stagnant pay. And what about the argument on the other side that investing in these other aspects support staff is a better way to spend the money? That's a credible argument. And actually, I heard that from some teachers. Some teachers said, \\\"You know what? My job is easier and my students' lives are better and my school is better functioning when I have more staff, when my class sizes are smaller.\\\" So it's not obvious that it's a bad trade-off to say we're putting more money into additional staff rather than paying existing staff more. The researchers I talked to as well said there isn't a clear research evidence on that question one way or another. So Matt, how are states now looking at fixing this? We have some that are now considering these pay mandates. Do they have any traction? We see, but a handful of states saying, \\\"You know what? We are going to mandate a higher starting salary.\\\" And how big of an effect that's going to have depends on where the starting salary was previously. But we do know at least one state, Arkansas, they set a salary minimum of $50,000, which is very high, especially in rural parts of Arkansas for first year teachers. Most states it doesn't seem like they're going that drastically, and some states are still just debating this. But that's something that states are considering to sort of force the issue. What about on the national level? Is there anything to be done there? President Biden very briefly mentioned it, but he hasn't laid out a particular plan to do so. And we have a divided government, and so there's very little chance in the short term that something's going to happen. There has been a bill proposed by Democratic Congress members to raise a minimum starting salary to $60,000, and that would be a really big deal in certain parts of the country, but at least for now, that appears to be a real long shot. There's a lot of resistance in some quarters of the federal government stepping in here because education has historically been a state and local driven issue. This is so interesting to me because I know a lot of teachers and they were struggling a lot during the height of the pandemic. And a lot of folks left their profession. On the flip side, you also have people like those you spoke to who say, \\\"We're not quite in it for the money. This is for love of the job.\\\" And I wonder how that's breaking down and how that fits into the debate over where to spend funding on schools. Different teachers have different ideas, but I think teachers really do feel like, \\\"I knew that this was what I was getting paid. I knew I wasn't going to get rich being a teacher. I knew I was maybe getting in it for better benefits, for better job security, for the love of teaching and for wanting to do good.\\\" And at the same time, they feel like, \\\"I'm really not well paid for how hard I'm working.\\\" I story notes a lot of other professionals, nurses, architects, lawyers, of course engineers, accountants, college professors, are all better paid, have better salaries at least than teachers, and so teachers feel frustrated by that. What you might see is a bigger impact on the salary piece of people who are considering becoming teachers. If you're already in the profession, it's harder to leave, it's harder to start a new career. But the people who are considering the profession, they have all the options available to them, and so pay could make a particular difference in whether you're deciding to become a teacher or not. The US and the UK are condemning China's growing aggression in cyberspace. Today, the Biden administration hit alleged Chinese hackers with sanctions and criminal charges. The British government meanwhile accused Beijing of hacking the UK's electoral register to steal the personal details of tens of millions of voters. The combined actions are the latest by Western governments to put pressure on Chinese leader Xi Jinping over what the West sees as a global hacking operation. Officials have attributed that campaign to Chinese intelligence agencies. Israeli officials have canceled high level meetings with the Biden administration in Washington. The decision comes after the UN Security Council approved a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. US abstention allowed the UN Security Council to pass a resolution calling for a ceasefire for the first time since the war began last October. Israel has opposed the demand unless it is explicitly linked to the release of hostages taken by Hamas. The European Union has launched investigations into Apple. Meta, and Google parent, Alphabet, under its sweeping new digital competition law. As we've been reporting, the EU's Digital Markets Act took effect earlier this month. It requires some of the world's biggest tech companies to comply with new rules aimed at increasing competition and digital advertising, search and apps. The investigations announced today are the first under this new law. If the companies are found to be in violation of the rules, they could be fined as much as 10% of their worldwide revenue. All three tech companies said they'd engaged with EU officials on the new rules. Apple said it's confident its plan complies with the new law. Google said it would continue to defend its approach and that it had made significant changes to the way its services operate in Europe. Meta said offering subscriptions as an alternative to ads is a well established business model in many industries. And that's What's News for this Monday afternoon. Today's show was produced by Anthony Bansie with supervising producer Michael Kosmides. We'll be back with a new show tomorrow morning.\",\" Saturday, March 2nd, 2024, I'm Jessica Rosenthal. The fight for the presidency went south to Texas this past week as President Biden tried to put the border ball in Republican's court. Former President Trump put the migrant crisis squarely on Biden. You had Biden thing, work with me, Mr. Trump. Let's do what's best for America, but then in an eagle pass, Trump at almost the exact same time was calling the migrant crisis Joe Biden's invasion and blaming the president. I'm Jared Halpern. The longest serving Senate leader ever is stepping aside sending shock waves across the beltway. Father time remains undefeated. I'm no longer the young man sitting in the back, hoping colleagues would remember my name. This past week President Biden made the second trip of his presidency to the border and after meeting with border agents, ICE agents, asylum officers and others in operational briefings in Brownsville, Texas, he said they all need more resources. Need more agents, more officers, more judges, more equipment in order to secure our border. Folks is time for us to move on this. We can't wait any longer. Over 300 miles away, an eagle pass, former President Trump put all of the blame for millions of people entering the country, claiming asylum and being told to show up for a hearing years later on President Biden. This is a Joe Biden invasion. This is a Biden invasion over the past three years. He referenced crimes committed by illegal aliens, including the suspect in the murder of University Georgia nursing student, Lincoln Riley. Joe Biden will never say, Lincoln Riley's name, but we will say it and we will remember it. We're not going to forget her. It's been just a horrible story that we've had to live with for the last few days. It's hard to believe and her parents are just they can never be the same. While Trump criticized Biden, Biden criticized Republicans for failing to pass a border bill that he says after more than three years into his presidency would have addressed many of the issues at the border. But when he mentioned the bill, he also talked to former President Trump directly. Set a plan policy to this issue. Set a telling members of Congress to block this legislation. Join me. Or I'll join you in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security So we'll an attempt to put the ball on this in Republicans court matter politically and would former President Trump ever work with President Biden? Well, if I'm being honest about it, I'd say probably not. He's been reporting live from the border. I mean, what we witnessed on Thursday was truly something like out of a old Western gun slinger showdown. You know, you had President Trump in the Eagle Pass, which was certainly the epicenter of the unprecedented migrant crisis. I've spent most of September in October in Eagle Pass when you had more than 2000 on multiple days crossed right in that area under that bridge. And as that was there reporting, Jessica, I literally knew because I'm with the border patrol agents that there were only six or eight, no more than 12 border patrol agents on shift. It didn't even give in time dealing with upwards of 2000 people. And it was such a unbelievable snapshot of how the cartels and the migrant crisis had just overwhelmed our capacity there. And they really opened the eyes for the country. But then, of course, go back to Thursday and you saw Trump in Eagle Pass standing there where Texas has put a miles of razor wire to literally shut it down to a trickle, a drop in a bucket, just a few hundred at most on any given day in that area. In Biden came the Brownsville, which even before that migrant crisis in Eagle Pass, Brownsville was the epicenter. The Jessica in my orcus and then border patrol chief, where the teeth came down. I interviewed them when they were here on the ground talking about the crisis. So then you had Trump and Biden giving these doing speeches. And in, of course, as you mentioned, Biden's speech, he called out his predecessor. And by the way, the two towns are separated by about three or a mile. You had Biden saying, work with me, Mr. Trump, let's do what's best for America. But then in Eagle Pass, Trump at almost the exact same time was calling the migrant crisis Joe Biden's invasion and blaming the president. And clearly what you were witnessing was a political, doing political speeches. And the weaker position, if you will, was probably the current president, Joe Biden's position because you see poll after poll just had a gallop poll this week saying that the top issue by 28% was immigration, the first time in Gallup's history. The immigration has searched the top like that. And so, you know, the Biden campaign knows that they are vulnerable in this. And clearly, President Trump is showing their indication of wanting Republicans to work with Biden in an election year. So I'm not terribly optimistic that anything is going to happen or that any sort of bipartisan legislation can get any daylight right now because of how high the election stakes are. Now, we can talk separately about what President Trump could possibly do if he gets back into office. But short of that, it's pretty clear that the Biden administration is going to have to take some sort of executive order action to at least have the appearance that they're trying to bring numbers down because all of the chaos in all of the months I spent in Texas, it's moved out well. Griff, it is interesting. So President Biden made this point that as he received his operational briefing, he was saying everyone keeps telling me they need more resources, more resources. But you need more resources precisely because of how many people are flowing into the country. There was no discussion at least in prepared remarks that I heard about, you know, using the pen, using the authority to issue an executive order. But he has wide authority, right? I mean, we saw it under former President Trump much to just our discussion about remain in Mexico. I mean, if you want to do something you could. So Jessica, that's such a critical and important point to make with the stroke of a pen, you would think he could allocate. And when we talk about resources, there's two specific areas that the officials are saying they need to help. One is in the manpower and that is agents, board of parole agents, CDP officers. The other are asylum officers, asylum judges to more quickly approve or disapprove. And then the third end of this are the ICE capacity for both detention space and removal of lines. And clearly a congressional additional funding could do that. But, you know, when you're President of the United States, you can move allocations around, you can do things to try and stop it. But the one thing about resources that wasn't mentioned left out of the President's remarks and a big part of what the border officials will tell you is when you have the board of parole agents dealing in an exclusive interview a few days ago with the board of parole chief, Jason Ellen, he told me as much. He said, you know, border security is the fundamental, a fundamental component of national security. And we need more resources to do that. But when the current resources are being used, board of parole agents that is to transport and process migrants and not being out in areas where we don't have awareness where you've got bad actors coming across and drugs in contraband, that really is the shift that's got to change. But until policy's change, which this administration favors a release policy in the country, would notice this to appear alternatives to detention, you can't really having more agents to do the same thing. You're still leaving wide open those vulnerabilities where those that don't want apprehend, which many are have criminal histories and the like, that you're not you're not solving the fundamental problem of security. So Griff speaking of that part, it was Trump who mentioned Lincoln Riley, right? And the the growing number of victims of undocumented migrant crime. If such crimes continue, God forbid, this is an issue for President Biden, right? Because these are people who committed crimes, at least thus far, who were here before that border bill failed that Biden keeps pressing for. That bill wouldn't stop the crimes being committed by people who arrived here before that border bill tanked. How much of an issue are the security issues within the United States? These crime issues. These are real issues, Jessica. And these are paramount issues. And I don't know if you know, you may have seen the pool camera is the president left. You took no questions from the press, but of course we in the press pool will shout questions and sometimes answers. Here on camera, I shouted my question, which was I said, Mr. President, do you bear any responsibility for Lincoln Riley's death as a result of the policies? He turned and he walked away and ignored me, but it really strikes at the point of Lincoln Riley is just one of many instances we had in the same week of Lincoln Riley's death. We are seeing what's playing out near Washington, DC and Prince George County, Maryland. And I'll Salvador and migrant that was released through the community killing a two-year-old toddler, allegedly suspect in the murder of toddler, Dana, Louisiana, another migrant from Honduras accused of raping at knife point of 14 year old. So there are so many instances of the past two years of these migrants being released in the country that are now committing these crimes. And it is important to point out, as the administration often notes, it is accurate that the majority of those that are here for whatever reason that they're seeking a better life, that's not enough for asylum, but in fairness to them, they're not criminals, but yet there is a certain percentage. And look no further than ISIS fiscal year end report for 2023, you can look on there. Literally on page 15, they break down the migrants that they were apprehend, they were apprehend. They're among them like 1600 homicides, 1700 rapes, they were moved, they went out of the community, apprehended migrants, they've been released in the country, and then arrested them and ultimately removed them from the country. But the question is how many did we not get and how many are going to commit future offenses and that's the threat to communities. And it's important also to note, I think, Jessica, that the biggest threat to any community is actually the migrant community because when they're illegal, they go into their migrant communities and whatever city there is. And so those migrant-fitter non-citizens that aren't criminals but are living with them are at the greatest risk, not just the community at large. Griff, just a couple more for you. A recent monmouth poll finds, I think it's 53% now want a wall completed? That's compared to 42%, who's said so in 2019. So a sizable chunk of people now want a wall built more so than what we have. Trump notably went to an area that's now sealed up more, right? Shelby Park area. What does that say about the efforts to construct fencing, put up concertina wire, even if it results in a fight with the federal government, and this growing maybe appetite for more security? It says a lot and I'm glad you raised that point because where I am, right now physically it came monument where I was just mentioning back in May nine months ago the hundreds of acrossing all day long. That area is not an area that Biden came to see. He didn't come to that area that was the epicenter nine months ago the crisis because much like in Shelby Park, here in Palmeville, along that river, is miles of razor wire and obstruction that stopped and literally brought to a halt the crossings in this area. We did have a group of a hundred across this week since I've been covering it and they used bull cutters to get to the wire, but it's far and few between and so you're seeing that it works and there's an irony in I think that President Biden came to an area that's one of the slowest now in the country to make his photo up and to make his visit to the border, which is actually a slow traffic area, not because of things that his administration did, but because of things like obstructing, setting up obstructions like wall and razor fencing, which are policies that Biden opposes and yet Texas did it. So he didn't want to have a photo abstaining in front of what Texas did that bid reduce crossings rather he wanted to go and get a tour along the wall and the border here. And I think the American people see it. They see what's having these things that work and so that I think those poll numbers, I would predict to you will continue to go up that Americans believed that they want to see wall construction. Okay, lastly, Griff, because you saw with your own eyes, the man standing next to President Biden for most of his border trip was Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas, who was impeached by the House over his handling of this very border crisis. The Senate had seemed disinterested really in holding an impeachment trial on their side, but now Minority Leader McConnell and South Dakota Senator John Thune, they say a trial is actually the best way forward after a group of Republican senators said, yeah, we should have one. Mayorkas maybe is not out of the woods. What's your, I guess, what's your take? What's your sense of the closeness, President Biden feels with his secretary? Well, I think that, you know, I'll be surprised if the Mayorkas trial does get off the ground. And I was on Capitol Hill for days, you may recall covering when the House was impeaching Mayorkas. And they're impeaching for two reasons. Jessica, one is, is dereliction failure to carry out the immigration laws in the books, meaning stopping people from illegally crossing. And then the other is lying to the American people because the administration and he was the face of it, telling us for a month and months, years that the border was secure. When, in fact, it wasn't. However, here's the problem. And that is ultimately, de-justically, Mayorkas is essentially an officer of the president. And so, you know, there is, I think, some reticence even amongst Republicans that, well, if this guy who is the face of it, Mayorkas said this, is just carrying out his bosses policies. How do you hold him accountable? And that's why, you know, when our great reporter, Chad Perville and others often point out, it's been since like the 1800s, they impeached the secretary because ultimately, they're just following their orders. Griff Jenkins, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. And listen, we will continue to be on the border. And I'll just leave you with this, Jessica. We now see other networks and other media covering it because we put it on the front burner and let people see and decide for themselves what they make of it. But one thing is for sure, and you mentioned those polls, the American people are paying attention now, and it's going to be a big part of this year's election. Great. Thanks, Griff. Great to be with you. I'm Guy Benson. Joining the weekdays at 3 p.m. Eastern as we break down the biggest stories of the day with some of the biggest newsmakers and guests. Over the course of four Presidencies in nine sessions of Congress, one person has led Senate Republicans, Kentucky's Mitch McConnell. But this week he surprised many by announcing he will end his historic run at the end of this year, and for the first time since January of 2007, the GOP will have a new Senate leader. Father time remains undefeated. I'm no longer the young man sitting in the back, hoping colleagues would remember my name. It's time for the next generation of leadership. In a speech on the Senate floor in which McConnell grew emotional, he made clear he's not going anywhere yet. He'll finish his term as Republican leader this year, and intends to remain in the Senate as the senior senator from Kentucky through the 2026 midterms. I still have enough gas in my tank to thoroughly disappoint my critics. And I intend to do so with all enthusiasm with which they become a customer. But McConnell's exit from leadership signals a big shift in the Republican party in the ensuing contest to replace him will define a new era. Already candidates have emerged, Texas Senator John Cornyn is officially in the race. Others will no doubt join in. Mitch McConnell had told me that he had made the decision at the beginning of this Congress. It was just a question about when he was going to step aside. And I think for the people who are vying for his job, there are three main contenders. And I can talk about how they might not be the main contenders when we get to the actual vote in November. But John Cornyn, the former whip John Thune, the current whip and John Barasso from Wyoming, who was the Republican conference chairman, that basically they were glad that he made this announcement early on so people can begin to plan. So you're right, it was a surprise because this was very closely kept. That's signature Mitch McConnell played very close to his political vest. I think they were pleased with that. But here's the other factor that's so fascinating. In some respects, this was not a surprise. As you know, Mitch McConnell has not been on the same wavelength as former President Trump. And that's putting it mildly, frankly, although I'm told that that was not as big a factor in this as you might think, especially if say Mitch McConnell was going to still stick around. And and President Trump say he wins in the fall. Obviously they thought he might try to oust him. But I'm told that really wasn't a factor that Mitch McConnell had made this decision some time ago. There was the health question. I think that there were some senators who really started to have questions about his viability after he had these freezing episodes. He had this bad fall last March. Him was out from the Senate for about six weeks. And and he is 82. You know, he gave a pretty eloquent speech on the Senate floor. Mitch McConnell was not known for eloquence necessarily. He was known for for very straightforward political talk. And if you listen to him as I say, listen to precisely what Mitch McConnell says because he will tell you what he what he intends to do. And and you know, people will listen to his speech and everything else and say, Oh, no, he said this. I'm like, No, that's not quite what he said. But he grew emotional and almost kind of teard up a wept a little bit. I think that told you a lot about Mitch McConnell. There are some who have wondered if maybe this was a not so subtle signal to his former colleague and dear friend in the Senate. President Biden, maybe it's time to step aside. You know, people forget just how close they were in the Senate. And the fact that in 2016 you had then vice president Biden presiding over the Senate for the last time. This was in late December of 2016. The vice president is the president of the Senate and sometimes presides. And so vice president Biden at the time came to the Senate for the kind of a farewell. And Mitch McConnell on the floor in real time renamed this cancer bill for bo-biden. We hear a lot about Hunter Biden, but bo-biden the president's other son who passed away from brain cancer. And that was an emotional scene. So there's quite a bond between these two leaders. Yeah, I think what McConnell said was father time remains undefeated. Yes. And he's right. You know, I was asked a couple of questions about Mitch McConnell over the last several days. Obviously, you and I have both done a lot of reporting on on this. And he's been the only, by the way, Republican leader I've ever covered. I arrived here in DC in the fall of 2010. He was already well into his historic run as a Republican leader. I started with George Mitchell. There you go. But there haven't been many that you've covered. Well, George Mitchell, Bob Dole was a Republican leader then became the jury leader. Well, and in between Trent Lot, then Bill Fritz and then Harry Reed Mitch McConnell Chuck Schumer. Yeah. And it's not been it's been yeah, a pretty short list of folks that that Mitch McConnell finds himself in. But you know, what I had said is that, you know, to be leader that long takes a certain skill to be able to speak to, you know, the needs of your conference kind of know the pressure points when to use a stick, when to use a carrot. I think former speaker Nancy Pelosi obviously had that same skill set that Mitch McConnell has. But if we seen over the last several months, whether it's through Ukraine, Ukraine aid or whether it is through the immigration agreement that, you know, that grip that McConnell has had so long on Senate Republicans is slipping. Yes. And it's about the math because look at that vote for the International Aid Package a couple of weeks ago. There was a point in time where McConnell was all for this. He was the biggest advocate for money for Ukraine than anybody in the Congress, either body, either party. And then it was clear that that was not going to move because he had Republicans saying we have to do border security. So he said, okay, we'll do border security. And then Republicans kind of moved the earth underneath of him saying, no, no, we don't really want to do border security. Even though James Langford, the Republican from Oklahoma and Kristen Sennema, the independent from Arizona and Chris Murphy, the Democrat from Connecticut all put together, a pretty good bill that most people, if you're taking a, you know, a pretty serious look at this would say, yeah, that's a pretty tough bill. I mean, there was real teeth in that compared to some of the criticism that some people have leveled at it. So that went away. But then look at the math on that vote for the international aid package. He could not even get half of his conference to vote yes. There were 22 Republicans who voted yes. Okay, that's a sizable figure. But it's not the 25. That's not half of 49. You know, and so, you know, the writings on the wall here, you're not getting half. It was intimated to me in the past couple of days here that at the usual Tuesday, Senate Republican launches that there is this pro maga show that goes on, Mike Lee from Utah, JD Vance from Ohio, Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, and that some Republicans are getting tired of that. Now people say, well, would he, you know, maybe lose his grip on the Republican conference now? You know, could they, they tried to oust him now? There's some internal rules and reasons why they might talk about that and why they might even have a meeting to do that. But they're not going to prevail because that is a secret ballot. And Mitch McConnell still has the support, even though he didn't have half of the conference on the international aid package. He still has the support of most of his Republicans. And keep in mind that when we get to that vote for whomever it might be on an icy cold, blustery day in late November, maybe early December, guess what? That is a secret ballot too. And that's why it's hard to divine who might be his successor. You know, you mentioned that sort of maga show that happens at these weekly lunches. We certainly saw the influence of former president Trump as it relates to that immigration and border bill as well. You know, Mitch McConnell had worked really closely on that emerging compromise with Chuck Schumer. The two of them seemed to have an agreement. You heard, you saw that statement from McConnell where he said, this is a time to act. This is a moment and an opportunity. And then he backed away from it after the former president intimated that he did not think that this was the right strategy. I asked that because what if in the next week or two or three, the former president puts on social media, why wait till November, Republicans should pick X Senator right now to lead them? Yeah, that's a possibility. But again, senators are going to make their own decisions. And here's why we don't know how this is going to go in the fall. That universe is not formed. We have to find out which party wins the presidency, first of all. And again, that might take control of the cynics to figure out, well, it might take a while to figure out control of the Senate, too. You know, I mean, I mean, you know, it took, it took, you know, more than a week or about a week or so before we really knew who won the presidency in 2020. It took us until January, early January to determine in 2021 who would won the Senate because of a runoff in Georgia. So those factors could delay the leadership election. And let's say, you know, President Trump wins, well, that will have a, you know, an influencing factor here. Let's say President Trump does not win. President Biden wins reelection. Okay. That will have an influencing factor. Let's say, Republicans get control of the Senate. And this is where I always talk about leadership elections, Jared, are not partisan politics. They are particle politics. Who gets into leadership? It is decided at the subatomic political level. What do I mean by that? You have all these political protons and leptons all, you know, whizzing around the super collider here, the political super collider. And you don't know, it's so microscopic, you can't tell. And case in point, this is how you had, this is how you had the election of John Bainer as the majority leader before he became minority leader and speaker back in 2006. He was considered to be a dark horse in a race to succeed Tom DeLay. Kevin McCarthy was supposed to succeed, succeed John Bainer as speaker in 2015, didn't work out quite yet, worked out a little bit later, barely, and not for long. Paul Ryan didn't want the job. You know who I left off my list earlier? Tom Dashel, who became the minority and then majority leader. But this is one of my favorite stories in all politics. And it deals with leadership elections. And this, this tells you why. So it's a secret ballot. So back in 1994, I mentioned George Mitchell. He was retiring in early 1995, you know, 1994. Democrats had lost control of the Senate. So Ben Knighthorse Campbell was a then Democratic Senator, Native American Senator, wrote a Harley, had a ponytail, wrestled for the United States, and judo team in the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. Different kind of kind of figure here. So Campbell was going to switch parties and become a Republican, which he didn't do until the spring, but Republicans had one control of the Senate. And what Campbell would try to do being a Native American is that he would always try to make sure that every vote he ever took was always consequential for Indian country. And so, you know, being in the majority party, that might have some influence, et cetera. So Campbell was going to switch parties, but he was still a Democrat in the fall of 1994. So George Mitchell was retiring and the Democrats were choosing a new Senate leader. The two candidates were Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Tom Dashel of South Dakota. Well, Tom Dashel won by one vote. Now, who do you think that Campbell voted for? He's a Connecticut Yankee or a man who represents the Sue Nation in South Dakota. You got it. And that's why you had leader Dashel and not Dodd, particle politics. So, I'm going to throw another name at you here. Two names. We've heard a little bit about Tom Cotton. He might be the MAGA candidate here. Tom Cotton has expressed interest in the leadership position. Rick Scott Republican, how floor did he win? Already challenged him once. Yes, but Rick Scott's damage goods because he did not run a very good campaign when he ran the Republican political campaign arm for Senate seats in 2022. And in fact, tried to undercut McConnell, et cetera. And some Republicans will say, look, you had your chance. That's not going to work. So who do you look at? Let's say the Republicans, and this is where I talk about the universe, has not formed, let's say the Republicans have a really good year in the fall. They flip the Senate. They just don't flip the Senate. It's 51. 49 or 52. 48. It's 55. 45 or something. Okay, they run the table. Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, who is the chair of the Republican political arm going into this cycle here and has made every single play the right way so far. In terms of the Montana Senate race, that's a competitive race there, to some degree the Ohio Senate race up and down the board, he's done all the right things. Particle politics. We will really be able to explore this conversation in the fall, but not truly until the fall of year. Returning quickly to McConnell and kind of his legacy, I know obviously there has been a lot made about his very public disagreements with former president Trump and this belief among many Senate Republicans that there needs to be a Republican leader who has a better relationship with Trump. That being said, when you look at the first couple of years of the Trump administration, what gets done without Mitch McConnell, right? I mean that tax bill, the tax cut bill, the number of justices on the Supreme Court, the federal judiciary. That was all kind of ushered in by Mitch McConnell, wasn't it? Who took a pretty big gamble by the way and initially holding off on confirming Marit Garland to a Supreme Court seat in the final months of the Obama presidency? Yes, exactly. And that's where a lot of people will talk about, despite the problem that Mitch McConnell had with President Trump and vice versa. I mean the reason, probably the most consequential thing in terms of a legacy issue for former President Trump was what happened with the Supreme Court. And that's all because of Mitch McConnell. Even months before it was clear that Donald Trump was going to be the nominee of the Republican Party in 2016, what do I mean by that? Well, we had this unexpected vacancy on the Supreme Court in February of 2016 when Antonin Scalia died suddenly in the Supreme Court justice. And within hours, without consulting his conference, and this is sometimes the criticism of McConnell, is that he doesn't consult, he makes these calls. In fact, Rick Scott said as much to me earlier today, he said we're not going to fill a Supreme Court seat in a presidential election year. Well, what happened after that? Okay, well two things, three, four things, really. So, okay, so Merrick Garland never gets a hearing, never sits on the court. Okay, so that seat is open in 2017 with President Trump. So what does he do? He gets Neil Gorsuch in. Well, there had never been a filibuster of a Supreme Court justice to sit on the court. There had been a filibuster of promoting a sitting associate justice to chief justice that was with Abe Fortis in 1968, but not to actually get somebody onto the court. Democrats were going to filibuster. And so what do McConnell do? And this is kind of taking a trick from the Harry Reid book. He basically established a new procedural precedent, a nuclear option, as it's called around Capitol Hill, to go over the filibuster, prevent a filibuster, and basically get Neil Gorsuch on the court, and then Brett Kavanaugh, remember that was quite an experience, that confirmation battle. And then the PSD was Estance came in the fall of 2020, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, God, and Elixir. Yeah, I'm shocked. There's gambling in the casino, Jared. And it was September. And they got her through just days before the election. Before the election. Yeah. And what are and what are the consequences of that? Well, through I mean, just look at what we have. Yeah, I mean, it's see, see, see, these all, all this, and it all started with Mitch McConnell's call without consulting his conference on a late Saturday afternoon in February of 2016. Seriously, that's the lineage right there. That's all Mitch McConnell, whether you like it or not. I want to finish the McConnell discussion, just kind of like I had been asked kind of about my experiences covering him. And I said, you know, I was always struck by his reverence for the Senate, like a lot of people who serve in the Senate. He really reveres the institution as an institution, the history. And I told the story, I think the first time I was in McConnell's office was probably 12, 13 years ago. I was new covering the hill. He invited a couple of radio reporters in for these sort of off camera gags, sort of round tables he did. And it was my first time in that office, which is you know, Chad used to be the Library of Congress. That is where the fire was set by the British in 2014. And McConnell took great pleasure in kind of, you know, telling me the history and showing me that fireplace where the chip is in it where there was a melee is they set the fire. And you know, you just think about the legacy of the Senate and the legacy he leaves behind. What's your McConnell story? Everybody's got one. Well, there's several. I just told you one there. One of the things I kind of enjoyed talking with him about and you know this that I have studied Scotch and Bourbon for quite a while. And I had just been to Scotland and I was sitting at a restaurant near Capitol Hill and he came out. He had a fundraiser or an event of some sort and saw that I was drinking something and he asked me if it was Bourbon. It was not Bourbon. It was a Scotch. It was Lafroy which is from Scotland. And I said, I'm sorry to disappoint you. So I saw him a couple of days later and I had just been to Scotland and I said, I want to show you something. And I had been to class over there, Scotch school. And what they do in the in the Scotch industry is they love to get their hands on a good Kentucky or Tennessee barrel. Tennessee whiskey, Jack Daniels, but Kentucky Bourbon, Heaven Hill, Buffalo Trace, you get the idea. So I was at Glenn Grant, which is a distillery in Scotland in space. And I was amazed going through this was actually part of the class going through looking at their barrels and it's Kentucky barrel of Bourbon after Kentucky barrel of Bourbon after Kentucky barrel of Bourbon. And so I showed him the picture. I said, look at this photograph, all this Kentucky bourbon here because what they do is they reuse the barrel. And he says they use our barrels to make their stuff. And I said, yes, he goes, well, that just proves that we make the best stuff. That's why they want to want our barrels. And I thought that was pretty fun. And you know, the other thing too. Kentucky is through and through. Well, President Trump used to call him Old Crow. And so the colonel figured out a way to kind of spin that because his favorite whiskey, one of his favorite bourbons is Old Crow. But more specifically because of Henry Clay, his favorite bourbon was Old Crow. And he said, I take it as a great honor to be called an Old Crow because that was Henry Clay, the statesman from Kentucky, who was a senator and was speaker of the house. Probably the best known Kentucky and politics besides Mitch McConnell, frankly. He said, I wear this as a badge of honor because Old Crow was Henry Clay's favorite whiskey. Don't think that's the way that former president Trump meant it. I wanted to ask you about one more event this week. And that is obviously, you know, we have the government shutdown averted in other kind of stopgap moving that date, that deadline around that came about after a big four meeting, the top congressional leaders meeting at the White House that I was interested in because as they emerged from that meeting, the speaker of the house came out by himself, my Johnson and said that he had a follow up one-on-one with President Biden to kind of lay out the Ukraine and border funding bills in those discussions. And you and I have kind of talked about how, you know, Johnson is still, I think, finding his way a little bit. This is a tough job. He didn't have a lot of training for it kind of thrown into it. What is his relationship like at this point with President Biden? Is that improving? Well, they really had no relationship at all. And it's hard. You know, there was a little bit of a relationship between Kevin McCarthy and President Biden because, you know, McCarthy had been in leadership before, had been the majority leader, whip, you know, minority leader, et cetera. There was something there. But Johnson, you know, drinking out of the fire hose, you know, nobody knew who my Johnson was in early October, you know. I mean, this was, this is how quickly this is, this is changed. So that's a big deal right there. So, you know, sometimes there are, you know, fellowship building exercises. And so, but that's something else that Johnson had been wanting to talk with the President individually, want some meetings. You know, there's a question about Ukraine. He's also just trying to get to know somebody. You see, and that's where I talk about, you know, McConnell and Biden, you know, it should not be lost on people that there was a relationship there. And we'll continue to be for at least the next few months. So that's, that's kind of important in that sense. But the fact that Johnson, you know, is having to deal with President Biden. And, you know, here's the other thing, you know, we don't know what's going to happen to Mike Johnson. I mean, he might, there might be a motion to vacate the chair in a minute. Okay, he might not be speaker right away. We don't know if Biden's going to be around after the election, you know, if he doesn't, when there's some speculation that maybe he doesn't truly run or become, he's running right now, obviously, but, you know, is not the nominee or stands for re-election in the fall. We don't know. So, you know, and this is where I say, you know, all this moves quickly. You know, I talk about George Mitchell, you know, this is where, you know, not all the, not not everybody is here in these positions forever. You know, and even though Mitch McConnell was there an awful long time, there have been a lot of other people who have been the majority or the minority leader of both parties. Well, as McConnell said, Father Time is undefeated. Yep, yep, we're all on the clock. Chad, appreciate the chat. As always, have a good weekend. Thank you. Next week features two of the biggest political events so far this year. We will get you set for both from polling to expectations and how both nights can reshape the 2024 race. Until then, thanks for listening. I'm Jared Halper.\",\" I'm Charles Payne. I'm Martha McCallum. I'm Greg Jarrett. Friday, March 22nd, 2024, I'm Chris Foster. To beat Donald Trump again, President Biden tells Black and Latino voters, I need you. He is slipping with groups that Democrats really did not think they would have problems with, especially in a head-to-head matchup with President Trump. But he's been making inroads in ways that other Republican candidates have not done. I'm Dana Perrino. The American workplace has transformed in the past five years, and it's not just where Americans are working that's shifted. Why Americans are working has changed as well. But I think this is kind of a millennial concept of work-life balance that I don't blame them for coming up with, because the baby boomers told them there was something called retirement where you can check out altogether for 30 years. So if you're going to end your life in a 30-year vacation, I guess you're entitled to have the balance of yoga class at four in the afternoon. I'm Jimmy Fella. The next presidential primaries are tomorrow for Democrats in Missouri, Democrats and Republicans in Louisiana from a President Trump voted in Florida's Republican primary Tuesday. I voted for Donald Trump. Did somebody just say, who'd you vote for? Yeah, I voted for Donald Trump. Thank you. President Biden's been campaigning in Nevada, Arizona, and Texas this week appealing to Latino voters at a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona. You're the reason why, in large part, I beat Donald Trump. Yes. Let's beat him again. The support with black and Latino voters is lower than it was against Trump in 2020. While Democrats are worried about an enthusiasm problem with President Biden and some of these groups that are shifting over to the Trump camp, what also motivates Democrats is Donald Trump being on the ballot. Whether they are super excited about President Biden, whether they decide to stay home, whether they decide to cross over, what is going to happen is that people who love President Trump are going to show up, people who hate President Trump are going to show up. So the Biden campaign has to hope enough of those folks who don't really feel excited about voting for Biden in some of these groups, that enough of them feel motivated to vote against President Trump. But he is slipping with groups that Democrats really did not think they would have problems with, especially in a head to head match up with President Trump. He's been making inroads in ways that other Republican candidates have not done in a long time. He breaks all the rules, as we know. We had more primaries this week. Trump and Biden would five more states, well five for Biden if you can't Florida, which canceled this primary and just gave it to him. Since they were obviously going to win analysts are sort of looking under the hood in Florida in Ohio, about one in seven voters chosen Nikki Haley instead of Donald Trump. And these are presumably pretty engaged voters who bother to come out to vote in a decided primaries. Me and anything are not. Well, you know, the Trump people will say those were voters that we were never going to get. They pointed the fact that a lot of, you know, Haley donors are now going over to the Biden team versus showing up for the GOP nominee and saying, okay, we'll pour our money this way. Their argument has always been that Nikki Haley is pulling from people who wouldn't have voted for Trump anyway. And I do think there's definitely some segment of that. It will be interesting to see though, if those voters quote unquote, go home or come home. I'm not sure the GOP was home for a lot of the Nikki Haley voters. So there's definitely a segment that says, I'm an ever Trump or though, I'm definitely not going to vote for him even within the GOP. So we haven't seen a ton of outreach from from the Trump campaign going to those those Haley voters and where they could end up, you know, in contrast to what we've seen from the Biden campaign saying, you've got a home here with us come home to us. I mean, some of those Haley voters could be what they're calling, I like this a lot, what they're calling double haters, right? Who, who don't want either candidate and those, those voters could end up deciding the election, whether they tip one way or the other or just stay home. Yeah. And Chris, I think we have such an interesting vibe. I guess that's going on in this primary, not primary in that there are people showing up to vote knowing that their candidate or their cause is not going to win, but they're taking time out of their days to actually go vote. We think about them more than 100,000 people in Michigan who voted uncommitted against the current president because they're very angry. We think mostly in part about how he's handling Israel and Gaza. But again, these Nikki Haley voters have shown up in numbers, knowing that she's not going to best president Trump in these early states. They knew she would get clobbered, but it was enough of the protest that they showed up. So we've got a lot of people who do not, and we knew this a year ago in the polling, they told us we do not want this rematch, but they're ticked off enough about it. They're taking time to go and vote and let you know they don't want it, even though they know that's what they're getting. New Trump campaign fundraising numbers out a couple days ago for February, they brought in $20 million. That's up campaign has $42 million in cash on hand. That's compared to the Biden campaign, 53 million in fundraising in February. Again, Trump, 42 million cash in the bank, Biden, 155 million cash on hand. Any insight into why there should be a gap, and I wonder what effect changes that the Republican National Committee might have on fundraising. Yeah, it feels like to me, I don't know what you think, but I feel like the Biden campaign is just really starting the general election in earnest. Trump has been campaigning for well over a year for this primary fight. A lot of his money, tens of millions of those dollars have gone into legal fights. I mean, they're just burning through an enormous amount of money, but he's been pulling from the donors for a much longer period of time. I think the Biden Harris campaign is really just starting to do that in earnest. They had a great bounce out of the state of the union. They did have good numbers on that front. They didn't get the bounce in the polls. So the Trump folks, I think, are feeling that they're going to continue coasting on what they think is better polling. They've really been at the fundraising and spending for a year that the Biden campaign has not had to do it. So it feels like maybe for their donors, they're going to a lot of them for the first, maybe second time, where the Trump folks are going to them for fifth, sixth time. And at some point, the money is going to not catch up. Yeah. Did you follow this Supreme Court arguments about the social media censorship case this week? The questioning seemed to suggest on the face of it that the justice didn't necessarily think the Biden administration did anything illegal, communicating with these social media companies about post it considered disinformation. The question is coercion versus suggestion versus illegally sticking your thumb on the scale. Yeah, because I mean, there's obviously the legal principle and the precedent out there that the government can't pressure a private institution to the point that it is speaking with the government demands of it. So there's that whole question about how far is too far when they reach out and they want what they call misinformation disinformation taken down. Some of what they were pressing on with regard to COVID turned out to be factual. So there's got to be a consideration of how influential the government can be over private companies when it comes to speech. So yeah, I think this is going to be a very narrow ruling when we eventually get it. But I think it was troubling to people to hear one of the justices, Justice Jackson say, you're the way you're arguing this case. The first amendment hamstrings the government, which is what a lot of people think that the bill of rights and the amendments are supposed to do is to reign in the government. So I don't think there's going to be any kind of sweeping ruling in either direction, but I think there is a feeling among the justices, some of them, probably the majority, maybe a very slim one, that there has to be some kind of guideline so that the government isn't essentially forcing private companies to pair it only this speech it thinks is acceptable. Right. Explain what happened with Supreme Court in this Texas immigration law. Now allow me making it a state crime to illegal entry of state crime and letting local law enforcement arrest, prosecute, deport people suspected of being here illegally. Now is enforceable just for just a few hours. Why did a lower court then get to freeze it again and so quickly? So this is super wonky and strange. What the Supreme Court said when it issued its decision earlier this week, it said if the fifth circuit had issued a stay pending appeal, then we would have to go through this four factor test. This is what we would be looking at, but they didn't do that. There was sort of an administrative stay in place. So then the fifth circuit immediately steps up and says, okay, we're going to, we are now going to address this issue of the stay that we didn't put into place before. So essentially the Supreme Court seemed to be signaling like we're answering the question that's before us, but the fifth circuit hasn't taken the stay action, which is what we really probably should be answering that question. So the fifth circuit immediately jumps up and says, okay, we're going to have this expedited hearing and get to that point, the Supreme Court made. So the circuit not overruling the Supreme Court, which obviously couldn't do, but the Supreme Court saying we can only make a decision up to this point and then the fifth circuit jumping into say like, okay, we're now going to take that action that you would have been considering. Yeah, because the headline was Supreme Court says Texas is okay. Sort of, not really. That wasn't that wasn't the question they were answering. Right. And it's so it's all procedural and wonky at this point. They haven't gotten to the merits of this. I think this case does end up at the Supreme Court on the merits. I think they probably take it up at goes of Arizona's SB 10, 70 years ago. We haven't gotten that far. What we're just arguing about at this point is whether the law can be enforced while they're arguing the case on the merits as we know takes time. Four years ago this week, California was the first state to order people to stay home as much as possible because of the brand new ish, coronavirus pandemic. With the most drastic measures at that point, Governor Gavin Newsom was either praised for his decisiveness or criticized for going overboard. Like you said, I mean, the stakes were made and there's still books to be written with hindsight about what we did right when we did wrong. Then politically though, are we past it? I mean, a couple of years ago, people like Gavin Newsom might have been vilified on one hand or not on the other. Do we even care anymore? Is it a campaign issue? You know what? There are a lot of parents who care out there that's who I hear from who say there has got to be some accountability for the absolute havoc this wreaked on my child's life because for us adults, I mean, it was a horrible time period. Everybody was trying to do the best they could with the information they understood at the point. But for kids, this was a huge chunk of their life, whether we're talking about a five year old or a high school kid who misses all of the stuff, the college experience, the potential for scholarships because you couldn't play athletic teams. If that's what you were trying to go to school on, I mean, there were just so many things, kids isolated really big mental health issues for kids. So what I hear from parents who are angry and say, oh, no, I still expect somebody to be held accountable for this. Whether that's enough to make a dent in the campaign trail, I don't know, but there's still people who feel like there is accountability that has not been meted out and they intend to see it. March Madness underway. Do you care? Do you know? Do you have any picks? Do you do a bracket? I have not, but what I like to do is pick based on the mascots and the uniforms. I call them costumes. My husband corrects me. They're uniforms because the only ballot that's going to make history is the one that picks all kinds of crazy stuff and gets lucky. So that's my philosophy. What about you? You know, I kind of, I don't know a lot about college basketball. It's not necessarily my sport. I kind of try to just look at consensus and people I trust and then, you know, and then just I kind of do wisdom of the masses when I fill out the brackets and then you throw in a couple crazy picks just to them. Because you're not going to win if you just pick favorites the whole time. No. And around here in the DMV area where I am Northern Virginia DC, Maryland, when George Mason had its Cinderella thing years ago and there were only like three brackets in the whole world that I'm for seating the way that they did. It was such a great story and we loved it here locally. So I'm always pulling for the very strange upsets Cinderella kind of person. Yeah. That's the fun of the tournament, I guess. Thank you. Thanks Chris. Pull up a chair and join me for H.O. Campus stuffy. For me, former U.S. Congressman Sean Duffy, as we share our perspective on the discussions happening at kitchen tables across America. Hey there, it's me Kennedy. Make sure to check out my podcast Kennedy saves the world. It is five days a week every week. The American workplace is constantly changing. The rapid transformation of where we work was ushered in by the pandemic. In 2023, a Forbes study found nearly 40% of full-time employees either work from home or on a hybrid model. But with the prevalence of social media, more and more young Americans are online sharing their blunt personal thoughts on the traditional nine to five and the state of work culture. For decades, Americans have defined themselves in part by their work. Now, the younger generation and the workforce are pushing back on this idea saying they work to live, not live to work. How did we reach this reflection point in the workplace? When where Americans are now reconsidering what kind of purpose can be found in a full-time job. You know, for myself, first of all, just at a young age in life, work was such a therapeutic diversion. David Bonson is the founder and managing partner of his wealth management firm, The Bonson Group, an author of the new book, Full Time, Work and the Meaning of Life. My dad died when I was 20. He was 47 and he was like my hero and my mom has already gone. And so I just started adult life working and work was a healthy, therapeutic way to kind of get through that and gave me purpose, gave me something to channel my energies in. So I felt strongly about it. And then as I've worked and worked throughout my career, I've constantly felt this bizarre dynamic that people in our society seem really hesitant to be judgmental of those that don't work, but they sure don't mind judging people that do work. You know, you're constantly hearing the foray of you work too much and so forth. And then it was COVID. It was just the COVID moment. Everyone was looking for every excuse they could not go back to the office. And you hear all the time how depressed everybody is, how alienated they are, how polarizing things are. And I think, yeah, I think a job might help that sociological dynamic. Let's go back a little bit. So what did you do? What did you first start doing when you were 20? What were you working in? How did you decide or how did you know what you wanted to do? I had no idea what I wanted to do. I couldn't do what I wanted to do because my dad had a PhD in philosophy. He was this brilliant Christian intellectual. And I wanted to be a thinker, but I also wanted to make money. And I had no path to go to college or any of these things. I had friends who were in a band. I started managing their band. I didn't know how to do it. I just worked and worked and worked. And I sold the company, made money. And, you know, it just, it gave me something to do for those years. I got to a point where I didn't really want to do a band members anymore. So I got to change what I was doing. But by then I had a lot of self confidence, I had accomplished things. And I got to that difficult period of life. I'm skipping over a lot of years quickly, but that was pretty much the path. And I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, but it worked really well for me. So I do feel that I love to do mentoring. I feel I'm a little bit out of my depth on two particular questions. One is this idea of a work life balance. And there's an obsession with this question, like, how do you get the perfect work life balance? And I get the sense, especially with younger women, that they look at their peers. And they think, oh, she's got it all figured out. I had that happen recently where this young woman wanted to update on her mentoring. You know, she's now, she used to be a young mentee of mine. And now she's got a pretty high powered job, but about to have a family. And she said, I'm just worried and worried. And she said, I look at this other colleague of ours. And everything's going so well in her life. And I said, are you kidding me? Do you know how often that young woman comes in my office? And I say, everybody is going through something. And to me, the work life balance is something that there's just no perfect answer to. And I just work. Like, I love, I love work. I'm very fortunate. I love what I do. I love the people that I work with. I don't know how to have more balance. I actually feel like my life is balanced. So I don't know how to answer that question. And I heard you talking a little bit about it on the editors. And wonder if you could do that for us here? Well, I can because the whole question is kind of what bothers me. I mean, the answer becomes problematic because I think the existence of work life balance is a mirage. First of all, I make the argument that work is a vital and integral part of our life. So how do you balance something that's a part of your life with your life? And I ask people, and I'm being sarcastic, but it's a good point. How many of you go home and say to your spouse, sorry, honey, I'm working on marriage life balance tonight. I can't really talk to you right now. It wouldn't go very well. We don't balance marriage with our life. It's a part of our life. Work is a part of our life. Children, church, community, whatever the different things are. And so this myth of a compartmentalization that you can do a perfect asset allocation. In the book, I use the analogy of a closet that you're just going to have a section of shirts and a section of sweaters. And you know, your closet just comes out perfect in the end. No, sometimes, closets and messies. Sometimes you're short on certain clothing items and other times you can't find things. For me, there have been a lot of times in my career. I have three children. I like to think I've done okay with them. But there were times I did not come home for dinner because I had to work late. And there were times when I was leaving the office to go to a kid's soccer game or school event. That's just life. But I think this is kind of a millennial concept of work life balance that I don't blame them for coming up with. Because the baby boomers told them there was something called retirement where you can check out altogether for 30 years. So if you're going to end your life in a 30 year vacation, I guess you're entitled to have the balance of yoga class at four in the afternoon. But I don't think that's the way life works or is supposed to work. I think we're supposed to be productive all the time and integrate these various components and values and priorities into our day to day routine. It's seasonal. What do you tell people who say, yeah, okay, well, I get that. But my boss, you know, is a monster and contacting me at all hours of the night and don't understand. He or she doesn't understand that I need some time. What do you do with a boss like that? Well, it's funny because the technology is a big problem now, right? Even for myself, I am my boss running my own business and yet it's very difficult to unplug. So it takes discipline. It takes habits. You know, well, these days bosses are sort of begging for trouble because they know they kind of can't do that. Like I sort of wish I could have connectivity with people over weekends and evenings more, but you sort of aren't allowed to. But it's a conversation one has to have with their employer and just set boundaries. But I would say it's boundaries two is like the notion of I will not look at my phone after hours. There's no free lunch as we say in economics that you can do that and maybe the boss will honor it. You're probably not going to be climbing the ladder the way you want. So there's a sense of what you have to be available for the advancement of the company. If you're if you're vested in its success, but at the same time, the boss needs to respect your boundaries. When you are with kids and things like that, these things are not rocket science. I mean, we all figure out a way to make it work. We have to communicate. That's the thing my husband's always told me that every problem in every office or organization where there's a problem, it came down to a miscommunication or a lack of communication. So communication being so important. The other issue that I have a hard time talking with young people about is going into the office. Now, a lot of people want to be in the office and some of these jobs are not in the office, but the importance of being around people and being there for the meeting in the hall. Or the out of sight, out of mind issues that are going on are concerned to me. And I don't know how to advise people on that. Well, the first thing I say is because the appendix of my book is about this. I feel very strongly and I was writing about it all through COVID. And it's funny. There's a lot of kind of baby boomer CEOs, Jamie Diamond, JP Morgan, David Solomon, Goldman Sachs. They've wanted everyone back. The city here in New York seems very crowded. Other cities not so much. But what I say to younger people, which is what you're asking about is, do you do good work? And they say, yeah, I work hard, whether I'm remote or in the office, I'm working hard. I say, if you're doing good work, would you like anyone else to see it? Do you want to be seen? Do you want to be noticed? Do you want to have a chance meeting with the boss and the elevator? For me, I think it's incredibly selfish of Gen X and baby boomers because every one of us was mentored by people. And I was mentored by people in the hallway in the coffee room, you know, walking up and down. And so in finance, its research, the analyst was traders with advisors with clients. It's real time. So it's been a huge competitive advantage for our business that clients can come in and see us face to face. But just as much as some people don't want to go in, there's a lot that are craving the community and the collaboration. And it's become a hiring advantage for my firm that were five days a week in office. I really believe that most people want that energy. There's certain sectors, certain industries. It's a little different. But look at all the companies that said they were done in office. And now they've all brought everyone back. They're really cool tech companies that have gone back on what they said. Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, media companies, Netflix and Disney. They all have everybody coming back. And so I know they're trying hybrid and so forth. But the three words I use are brand, collaboration and culture. You can't build culture on a Zoom and yoga pants from your bedroom. And if everyone's just being honest, they're not working as hard five days a week. They're just not Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont, suggested we should go to a 32-hour work week. And it's almost as if he thinks the government has helped people get to a point that he could suggest that. Well, actually, that's not how this works, sir. But what do you think about the idea of a four-day work week? You know, it's so interesting. As a lifetime conservative, I'm so used to being accused of being the elitist. And I thought it was one of the most elitist things I ever heard. Because he said, well, AI has made it that we can do things more efficiently. And I was just wondering if he wants to say it to the blue collar people, the work at Laundromats and our bus boys service business. This was the whole thing during COVID policy. It was really cute ideas for certain people, but it wasn't going to work for others that have to punch in, punch out. They can't do it in 32 hours. And people paid hourly. They don't want that. So he's suggesting something for a certain segment, a more managed, gerial, mid-level, white collar profession. First of all, the entrepreneurs and risk takers of society are never going to do it. Okay, it's just that it's not in their DNA. My wife would not let me work 32 hours. She would be forcing me out of the house to go find something to do. So it's totally unrealistic. It's statist. But it also misses the point of why we work. It is not merely that we can work less so we should. I believe that God made us to work. I believe He gave us purpose and dignity in work. So the presupposition of a Vermont senator that what we're all trying to do is work less is, I think, incredibly arrogant and misguided. He doesn't reflect a good understanding of the human person. Zoom way out and talk to me about where we are right now with the culture of work and our own national competitiveness in a very interesting time. With the technological revolution and our adversaries on the march. So everybody says that China is our adversary, but we don't act like it when it comes to work because we say we want to work less and they want to work more. It's a very good thing that Europe has not been a very worthy adversary when it comes to economic productivity because they've long ago kind of given into this idea of less work. I think that America has to gauge itself against what it's capable of, its own productive capacity and we're underperforming what we can be as a country. We can be more economically productive. The largest segment of that is men that are between the ages of 20 and 49. 55 plus, there's a certain amount that have retired. We've talked about that, but that number isn't going lower. The labor participation for us brews as I see it is not with women at all and it's largely with men and I think that this notion of prime working age men that are living at moms basement till they're 30 something years old. I think it needs to stop. It's not good for the solar society. It's not that I want to shame them or insult them or make fun of them, but it's that I care about them and I don't think that they are living the full fulfilled life they're capable of. Beautiful David Bonson. Thank you. Thank you, Dana. And now some good news with Tanya J. Powers. Amelia Bernard is just five years old, but she recently marked a major milestone in her life. She completed her final chemo treatment. Boston 25 reports that she's battled leukemia for more than two years and this week she was taken to that final treatment in style. She rode in a limo with a police and fire escort to Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island and she was surrounded by friends, family and even the mayor when she walked in. The motorcade was organized by Enzo's Escorts, a Rhode Island police and fire organization that offers children VIP escorts to and from their homes on our last day of cancer treatment. It was started four years ago and since then they've provided 40 escorts. Amelia's mom, Carly Bernard said the final treatment was like a light at the end of the tunnel and she says it didn't feel real. I'm so happy that Amelia is done and can go back to whatever normal is, but it's also like a huge chapter of our life's closing. One of the normal things Amelia has on the horizon, starting kindergarten in the fall. Far too often, women's lives are cut short as they fall victim to unthinkable crimes, but each week this month I'll be joined by women who fought back, survived and took back control. You won't want to miss this month's stories of survival, strength and resilience. Yine Thela. What's on your mind? Where is Kate Middleton? That's the question a lot of people are asking after Catherine, the Princess of Wales seem to disappear out of the public eye a few months back. Now to be honest, I'm not an expert on what goes on at the palace. If anything, I know more about the Kansas City Royals than the British ones, but the hysteria hooked me into the story. Started last week when Kate posted a photo of her and her kids that was later taken down because the palace admitted to photoshopping it. Now I don't see the outrage about photoshopping pics because if we're being honest, everybody photoshopped every single picture they ever post online. I'm not kidding when I say that back when I was a cab driver, I once saw a guy photoshop a picture of his junk before he sent it to somebody. Crazy story, but it was nice to meet Anthony Weiner. But as for Kate's photoshop fiasco, at the very least, we should all be able to agree that it's nice to see a royal taking pictures with underage kids besides Prince Andrew. But none of that was enough to stop the rumor mill from turning out one wild story after another. Some said she was trying to distract from bigger health issues for King Charles. Others claimed Prince William was having an affair and she left him a dear John letter, or a dear John Thomas, if you're picking up what I'm putting down in the royal bedroom. Regardless, she's doing a much better job of getting privacy than Prince Harry and Meghan Markle who were so committed to escaping the public eye that they started a podcast in a Netflix series. And you'd think that Kate Chaos would have died down after a video surface this week of her shopping at an English farm stand with Prince William. But things have only gotten crazier with many people now insisting it wasn't her because she died and they're using a body double. Okay, that's insane. But I guess it's better than propping up a dead person like we're doing with our president here in America. The point is we don't actually know where Kate Middleton is, but I can guarantee you she's in a much better mental state than the people speculating about her.\",\" Sunday March 24th, 2024. I'm Jessica Brosenthal. But the Biden administration's urging caution and still expecting Israel to make its case at the White House this week. We're going to sit there and we're going to talk to them about some of our perspectives and we're going to share with them some some viable options here that hopefully give them pause to think about Rafa operations in a different way. I'm Jared Halper. The Veepe Stakes is underway giving us weeks of drama over who former president Trump will tap is his running mate. Vice presidential candidates don't necessarily win elections, but the pick of the wrong one can can help lose it. A delegation from Israel supposed to come to the White House this week ahead of Israel's promise to go after Hamas in an area of Gaza called Rafa. It is full of civilians. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said from Egypt next to the country's foreign minister what the priorities are right now. Cease fire, release of hostages, humanitarian assistance and a clear pathway in plan for the future. He said last week that when they speak to the Israeli delegation this week he hopes to make clear why we think it would be a mistake to engage in major military operations in Rafa, but also why there's a false choice involved that it is possible and indeed necessary to deal with the ongoing threat posed by Hamas, but without a major military operation. That's what we want to discuss. Egypt's foreign ministers said he thought a double standard was being applied to the Palestinian cause that the moral basis upon which they can rely on a world order are being strained here. This should be recognized as a severe challenge to our ability to work together, to continue to cooperate on unpredictable set of principles. All of that was Thursday. Friday, Blinken met with Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom our Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer recently called an obstacle in the war. He also called for new elections in Israel. Netanyahu says he told Blinken that Israel is grateful for U.S. support and that he recognizes the need to evacuate civilians from battle zones. I also said that we have no other way to defeat Hamas without going into Rafa and eliminate the remaining Hamas battalions. I also told them I hope we will do it with the support of the U.S., but if we have to we will do it alone. Friday, the U.S. proposed resolution for an immediate ceasefire along with a release of hostages failed at the UN Security Council with vetoes from Russia and China. They said there should be a ceasefire regardless of the hostages. It is not the first time a U.S. resolution regarding the war between Israel and Hamas has been vetoed. The hope is that we can get the hostages out. John Kirby is the White House National Security Communications Advisor. And the hope is that we can get a six-week ceasefire place so that the violence can come down so that more aid can get in to Gaza. Why does the UN need to be a part of it, though? We believe it is important for the United Nations and for the international community to stand up for all the same things that are so important to the people of Gaza and to the Israeli people. I mean, this resolution that we submitted also included a condemnation of Hamas. No other resolution prior to the one that we submitted was willing to go as far as condemning Hamas for what they did on the 7th of October. So we believe it's important that the international community speak with one voice about what matters here and what we should all be pushing for. He hopes it continues. But there is no scenario in which Hamas is eliminated without Israel going into Rafa. And if they have to do that, they'll do it alone. But we all know a delegation is supposed to be coming to the White House. That's right. With what? To present a plan? I mean, what's happening? Will Israel wait until after it's presented the White House a plan? I think you'd have to ask the Israelis about their military plans. I'm sure certainly not going to get into talking about that for them. What I can say is that we still don't support a major ground operation in Rafa. Certainly not one that doesn't properly account for the 1.5 millions of gauze and refugees who are in Rafa. Because of operations that happened to the North in previous weeks, there's got to be a plan to make sure that we can ensure their safety and security. And a major ground offensive right now, as we've said, would be a disaster. So we've invited this delegation to Washington, DC. They'll be here soon. We look forward to discussing with them some of our lessons learned and perspectives in urban warfare and dense environments and sharing with them some other alternatives that they should be considering before they move in and in a major and conduct some sort of major ground operation. We see the secretary, we see Secretary Blinken. I know you're not state. But we see Secretary Blinken meeting with officials from Egypt, with the Jordanians, with the Qataris. Is there any pressure on them, especially Jordan and Egypt, rather than Israel to say, you know, if you care so much about Palestinian civilians, why aren't you letting them in? I thought I thought in global affairs, that's what happens is the nearby countries who are sympathetic would open their doors. Well, we don't want any sort of force relocation of the gauze and of gauze and Palestinians outside Gaza. And most folks in Gaza don't want that leave because they're concerned about if they left, would they be able to get back in? And we are talking to our counterparts every single day about what they can do to help increase the flow of humanitarian assistance. That includes Jordan. That includes Egypt. That includes our other Gulf partners. I mean, this is a constant conversation that we're having with them. If the if this delegation comes to the White House before any any effort happens in Rafa, do we expect somebody at the White House, maybe even the president to sign off on some plan or make some statement after the delegations left? And is there a risk there? Because if any, if there's any White House approved plan, does that mean the administration gets blamed? Now hang on just a second. I mean, how far how far are we going in terms of we are of approval or being being involved in what Israel is doing? There's an awful lot to that question. So let me just try to break it down here. Israel is a sovereign nation. And they were attacked on the 7th of October in the most horrific of ways. They have every right and a responsibility to look after their own security and to and to eliminate the threat that is posed by Hamasah group that wants to do October 7th all over again. And you know what, we're still helping them with the kinds of capabilities that they need to do that. We are not dictating their operations to them. We are not making operational decisions for them. We are and have I might might add since October of last year have been providing our lessons learned and our perspectives about this kind of warfare lessons that we learned in some very painful ways over the last 20 plus years in Iraq and Afghanistan. And it wouldn't be right for a friend of Israel as we are not to share those lessons learned. And so we look forward to having the delegation here next week. We're going to sit there and we're going to talk to them about some of our perspectives. And we're going to share with them some some viable options here that hopefully give them pause to think about Rafa operations in a different way and not necessarily go in you know in a major ground offensive with 1.5 million people that are that are facing potential starvation here and desperate need of humanitarian assistance. But you talk about lessons learned that's a really important point because if you're sharing if we if we are sharing that with Israel, then how is what is the lesson? How is Israel supposed to go into Rafa when Hamas, which is the target, is using Palestinians as human shields and there's still a tunnel network. I mean, yeah, you're right. That makes it really really hard, doesn't it? Because Hamas is not abiding by any kind of international rule of law here or law of war. They are sheltering behind civilians. It is made things very difficult for the Israelis. And it's not just that they're hiding behind civilians. It's that they're doing it in such a densely urban populated highly populated environment. Gaza is a tiny strip with a lot of people living in it. And Hamas is using that to their advantage. That's what makes this so difficult. And that's even why it's more important for us to share with the Israelis, you know, our thinking on this, our perspectives, as we have since the very beginning of the conflict. But ultimately, it's their decision to make. And this narrative out there that I've heard that we're sort of we're dictating terms to them or we're telling them how to conduct their operations is just bunk. It's just not true. We've never done that. And we're not going to start doing that. That said, we've learned what valuable lessons. And as a friend and an ally of Israel, we we feel it's incumbent upon us to to share those lessons with them so that they can do this in a way that doesn't put that 1.5 million people at greater danger. You mentioned aid and that people in Gaza are starving. You know, every time I hear aid discussed reporters say, what are you doing to get Palestinians aid? Israel's the problem. Israel's blocking the aid. So I'll take the flip side of that here because Israel says it's absolutely not blocking aid. That Hamas is getting in the way that looting is happening. We've seen videos on social media. Israel is even supporting this idea of a port to get aid in. It's interesting to hear Israel being blamed for the aid not getting in. So what then what is the solution here to getting aid in? No, there've been a lot of challenges about getting aid in a lot. It is a it's a war zone. You know, before the before the October, October attacks, there was 500 some odd trucks getting into Gaza every day because there wasn't a lot of fighting. Well, now there's fighting. And just being a war zone makes it hard to to to get trucks moving. There are checkpoints they have to get through. That is true. There have been some there's been some resistance on the Israeli side. It's certain crossings at certain times to to allow stuff in. We've worked that out with our Israeli counterparts. We're continuing to work that out with our Israeli counterparts. We have taken on the role of doing some air drops. It's not anywhere near enough and it's not going to supplement what you can get in by trucks, but we're we're still dropping things from the air. And you're right. Now we are moving by sea, a temporary peer to try to see if we can find another avenue, a maritime avenue to get aid in. There's a lot of work being done by a lot of folks, but there's a lot of challenges that have prevented aid from getting in. Just a couple more for you. We know after Senator leader of Chuck Schumer's speech about Israel, you know, he's saying Netanyahu is the block to peace. There are at least one block to peace. He said the fourth, right? And there needs to be new elections when the war winds down, quote unquote. We know the president said it was a good speech. It does seem like there's a divide among Democrats about supporting Israel versus supporting Palestinians. Is there a possibility in this Democratic administration? I don't even know if you can answer this, but is there a possibility that Israel loses funding or has funding cut or some funding cut? If if they're not on the same page with the United States. Well, look, I'm not going to talk about the Democratic politics one way or the other. That's not my place here at the National Security Council. I can tell you that you talked about support for Israel support for Palestinians and almost like it's a sort of a balanced equation or we know it's it's a binary choice. We don't view it that way. We're going to continue to support Israel. We are providing them weapons and capabilities. That support continues. They have a right to defend themselves and they need our help to do that. We don't want to see October 7th happen again. On the on the same token, we also have we all have the international community as an obligation to alleviate the suffering of the people of Gaza. They have they have lost tens of thousands of their friends and loved ones. Tens of thousands more injured and wounded in this conflict. They didn't ask for this. They weren't the ones storming that concert on the 7th of October. Hamas doesn't represent them other aspirations. They need help and the United States is going to continue to be a world leader and doing what we can to get them the food, water, medicine and fuel that they need. You can do both. A country as big and as powerful as us. It has to be able to do both. And that's what the president is focused on. Finally, we heard from Secretary Blinken after meeting with Egypt's foreign minister. A lot of mentions. A ceasefire, no immediate ground invasion of Rafa, the release of the hostages, humanitarian aid, even reforms to the PA. And it does get you thinking about the future. I know that there's a war. You said it's a war zone. But when we hear the secretary speak about a future and we see Mahmoud Abbas of the PA appointing, I think it's a prime minister, right, who has extensive experience with Gaza. Is the future here the PA running Gaza? I mean, I know we don't know, but what are we sort of thinking? Almost again, since the beginning of the conflict, we've been focused on a post-conflict future for Gaza and for the Palestinian people who live there. And this is something Secretary Blinken has spearheaded for the administration. And you heard your right. You heard him on this most recent trip talking about post-conflict Gaza. It's very much been on his mind. And we still believe in the promise of a two-state solution. And the president continues to believe that that's in the best interest, not just of the Palestinian people, but for the Israeli people as well. A two-state solution with Israel's security guaranteed. And one of the ways we believe that you can get to that is a revitalized Palestinian authority. And this gets to your direct question. We have seen Mahmoud Abbas in the Palestinian Authority make some personnel changes that have been welcomed, that have been indicative of the degree to which they are trying to move the PA forward. And we believe that that is the one of the key parts, key components, of being able to get post-conflict Gaza governed in a way that doesn't present a threat to the Israeli people or to the Israeli nation. But also does a better job looking after the aspirations of the Gaza people than what Hamas has done. Back to the question you asked me a little bit ago, which was a really good one and a fair one. They are hiding behind these civilians. They are making them targets. They are still there's been fighting over the Auschwifa hospital because they are still using the hospital to shelter. And to fight Israeli ground forces there. I mean, this is them putting the people of Gaza at greater risk. And they clearly don't have the Palestinian people best interests in mind. And what we believe is that we need whatever governance looks like in Gaza. And you're right, I can't give you the exact answer. But whatever it looks like, it can't be Hamas number one. And two, it's got to start with at least a revitalized Palestinian Authority that can again properly govern and look after those aspirations. White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby, thank you so much for your time. Yeah, my pleasure anytime. Is your March madness bracket already busted? If so, no worries. You can now spend your time on another American tradition of making picks. The Veeb stakes with former president Donald Trump securing the delegates needed for the Republican nomination. The next major touchstone in this election season in his campaign will be who he picks as a running mate. Every week it seems, new names emerge as potential vice presidential nominees leaving the impression the shortlist may not be all that short. Who a nominee selects is his or her running mate usually comes down to strategy, trying to make up gaps and say experience or voting blocks or even geographic appeal. Carl Rove, a former deputy chief of staff and senior advisor to president George W. Bush, says the selection also provides a window into a candidate's thinking. In a conventional campaign, this would have already started the process of vetting your potential nominee had already would have already begun, even if the primaries had yet to go on for a while. But it really depends on the instincts and the priorities of the candidate. The first priority from a political perspective is what can be done to help put the ticket in the best chance of winning the fall election. Vice presidential candidates don't necessarily win elections, but the pick of the wrong one can help lose it. What you need to do is start by making certain that you knight the party and that you fill in any problem areas that might hurt you coming down the stretch. For example, in 2008, you had the young brash Barack Obama, who had been literally a member of the United States Senate for four years and had no international experience. And so they picked a senior Democrat who had been at one point the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Joe Biden. In 2008, the same election, John McCain was trying to figure out how to energize the Republican party. And so he ended up picking Sarah Palin. 1980, Ronald Reagan demonstrated his bigness as a candidate and as a potential president by saying, I'm going to pick my principal opponent in the Republican primaries so that I can unite the party and go into the general election with everybody excited about having a piece of the ticket. So you start by trying to at least create no harm by having somebody on the ticket who's going to urge you that they're not going to help you a lot. But if you make the wrong pick, it can hurt you a lot because it can show a weakness that you've not tempted to fill. So as we look at former president Trump, obviously, I guess the quote from their spokesperson was the short list is pretty long. I guess we'll just call it a list then, but obviously unifying the party is still something I think that they are focused on, right? When you look at even if it's not a huge number, the number of Republicans who voted for somebody other than Donald Trump in these Republican primaries and the number of those who have indicated a level of uncomfortability with Donald Trump as a nominee. Well, first of all, he is the incumbent. I mean, we forget that we've been in this position since, you know, like 1892 on the Democrats. I'd, you know, we're over a Cleveland coming back to try and went back to presidency from Benjamin Harris, but he is in essence the incumbent. So the fact that somebody was getting 30% and nearly 40% in the primaries is problematic. But would be even more problematic if to anybody sitting inside that cockpit right now is that even after Nikki Haley got out 15 to 20% of the people in these recent primaries voted for her or somebody else. And that's a problem because again, he was the president of the United States as a Republican and he's running again for his party's nomination. And even after nobody is as opposing them, one out of every five people who turned out to vote in the last set of primaries or one out of six said, I'm not voting for the guy. So yes, he's got a united party really critical for him. So the other part that's fascinating about that is the last person he picked as his running mate in former vice president Mike Pence, who I think was also kind of a pick to try and consolidate the conservative base who were still kind of hesitant about about Donald Trump. That's not the dynamic now. But Mike Pence hasn't endorsed his former running and doesn't seem inclined to ever do so. Does that complicate the ability to kind of bring somebody in who can unify the Republican party? Yeah, we know it is a complicating factor. I mean, look, think about the members of the former president's cabinet who not endorsed him in won't. I mean, anybody think Rex Tillerson, former secretary of state is going to come out enthusiastically for Donald Trump or that, you know, they're just not going to happen. And what's interesting to me is most of the time a vice presidential nominee can help you avoid problems, but is not a great, you know, sort of advantage to one ticker or the other. But the vice president for each side is going to be critical. There are a lot of people who are saying that I've run into say, look, I liked what Donald Trump did, but I don't like him personally, but I do not want Kamala Harris to be president. And I worry about that is a prospect because Joe Biden is 81. He'll be 82 by the time of the next inaugural. It's elected. So Trump, on the other hand, has people who say, you know what, I don't like, yeah, I don't like him. I may have liked some of his policies. I'm a, you know, I really, I'm not going to vote for Biden. But he can cement them. He gives a better chance of winning those people. Maybe he's got somebody who says, you know, well, you know what, Tim Scott strikes me as a good man. And that's a solid individual. So just like Mike Pence helped him in 2020, you knight the Republican Party by bringing in evangelicals and midwesterners. And frankly, candidly, I'm I suggested it to the former president back in 2016, May of 2016. I think it was, I met with him after the Indiana primary mutual, you know, somebody who knew him took me to a meeting with him and my friend and his friend then candidate Trump asked him, who should I pick? And he, he gave a suggestion of somebody, which I didn't think, you know, I didn't agree with him when Trump turned to me and said, what do you think? I said, I know you, I like the idea of having somebody from the Midwest. But, you know, you might want to think about the governor of Indiana. He wasn't for you, but he didn't attack you. He was for Ted Cruz and he represents a more conservative wing of the party and the evangelicals like him a lot. And he's a midwestern governor and Indiana has the highest percentage of manufacturing jobs in the country. So if you're making a picture for the blue collar worker, he comes in from a state where the Republicans have made a tradition of being able to appeal to a working class people who are in the plant, various kinds of plants and and manufacturing facilities in the state and winning them. So, you know, again, Trump has got to figure out does he want to have somebody who makes him feel good, you know, as somebody who, you know, has sort of, you know, star power and but but the main thing is that he feels their loyalty and that they're strongly for him personally, or does he pick somebody who is obviously for him, but allows the other people would see as broadening his appeal and bringing in, you know, being basically a bouquet that thrusts in the direction of the other people who said, you know, I'm not vote for him even if he's the only guy left on the in the primary. Do you think he's considering Nikki Haley? Well, look, I know, I don't see he's not Ronald Reagan. He just doesn't big enough to say I'm going to pick George HW Bush, you know, I'm going to pick Nikki Haley. But the question is, is he thinking about, you know, somebody like say a Christy gnome or is he thinking about a Tim Scott, you know, and I for both of those names, the other thing that I've kind of the conventional wisdom out there is that, you know, the ticket is looking for a woman given obviously the role that abortion is expected to play in this race given that that is a demographic that the former president is kind of underperformed traditionally with other Republican candidates. What's your view on that? Adding a woman on the ticket is not going to solve that problem. What's going to solve that problem is having presidential candidate who can articulate a message about abortion that's got several components. One, empathy, you know, understanding that this is a tough decision. Two, reasonableness that they are in favor of as as president Trump has indicated, you know, look, we are to recognize that there ought to be limits and there ought to be a period of a reasonable period of time in which a woman can make that decision and abort the child and 15 or 16 weeks seems to be reasonable. There need to be exceptions, rape, incest, life of the mother and there there maybe there needs to be the decision that parents ought to be involved in the decision of their teenage daughters. But you know, and it ought to be left up to the states that, you know, as opposed to a simple federal answer, I think the one point that helped Nikki Haley a lot during the primaries was she sounded like the adult on that stage. We're not going to get 60 votes in the US Senate for any kind of abortion or to leave this up to the states as we in the pro-life movement they've been talking about for decades and as the Supreme Court clearly pointed to. So I think it what matters more how Donald Trump handles it than just simply adding a woman to the ticket. The other, I guess the new name out there now, at least this week is Marco Rubio, a former rival politically of Donald Trump points upon a time. I think that's all water under the bridge at this point. But you know, he's somebody who would bring that foreign policy experience given his tenure in the Senate. I don't know if we count Florida sort of as a swing state so much anymore, but that's an interesting name that I had not considered until I heard it kind of reported this week. Well, it's no longer a swing state because people like Ronda Santis and Marco Rubio came to the state and the advantage there is is that he would have an appeal in the Hispanic communities and there's not just one Hispanic or Latino community. Multiple ones and he comes out of the Cuban American experience, but also interestingly enough, spent part of his childhood in Nevada, which is going to be a battleground state where Latinos are a critical voting block and his life experience of being the son of a bartender and a hotel made allows him to deform a bond that could be particularly powerful. And I've seen it and it sought in as presidential race. We've seen it as races in Florida. He knows what it's like to start out on the shabby side of the middle class and work your way up and his parents were great examples to him. And that is one of the things that I think would make him particularly powerful in the Hispanic communities. How much, I guess I'm curious, you would know this better than I, is there an electoral problem with him picking some different Florida like one of them would have to move, right? Wasn't that like, didn't that come up with Dick Cheney? Yeah, that's a 12th amendment problem. Yeah. Donald Trump's voting residence is now in Florida, supposed to New York and that there would be a problem. Said the Democrats would have the same problem of Joe Biden. We're not running and Gavin with Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris, right? He's governor of California. He's the former US Senator from from California and which one of them is going to change your voting residence? That's a problem. It's not an movable object. I was just curious about not that that's something that once upon a time, I think the Bush ticket had to deal with, right? Exactly. Now the 12th amendment just for our listeners who don't know what what these two political birds are talking about, you cannot cast the votes of a state for a president and a vice presidential candidate from that state. This was passed in 1801 after the election of 1800 ended in a tie in the electoral college and it was an attempt to make certain that in the, you know, the small number of states that we then had, I think they were 16 or 17, that you didn't have political power concentrated in one state. And yes, in 2000, George W. Bush decided that he was going to pick the guy who was in charge of the process of vetting nine people that we're looking at. And we had to have Cheney. Fortunately, Cheney had lived in Wyoming, been a congressman. Looking congressman from Wyoming. Yeah, he had roots there. He had a residence in Wyoming. He was then living in Dallas running Halliburton, the world's largest oil field service company. And so, but we had to have him go back to Wyoming and on a Friday morning, reregister so that he could be announced the following week as the running mate and the 12th Amendment problem had gone away. I can not be movedable, but it is something that the think about is we look at these different Let me finish with this and that's kind of you kind of talked about the the challenges, obviously, with unifying, trying to find maybe where you have deficits in different voting blocks. How much do you try and find somebody, I mean, it's only one night, but that vice presidential debate, somebody who maybe has experience in that arena. Yeah, well, there are two moments you think about when you're thinking about the vice president. You've hit on one of them. How well are they going to perform in the vice presidential debate? The good news for the Republican nominee is is it almost whoever you pick is going to by nature do a better job than Kamala Harris, who is a dreadful public speaker and dreadful in debates. But here's the other thing you need to do. You need to have somebody who can speak at the Republican National Convention, which is going to be the most watched part of the campaign outside of the debates and make a good impression on the American people. And somebody who certainly can highlight, because whoever you have is probably going to have at least in their history some policy differences, right? So kind of the ability to set that aside and talk about the things that you agree on. Right. And also talk about then who they are. I mean, we look, we pick people not because we agree with them on the issues 100 percent, but because we broadly think that they're sort of in general agreement with us about what the big things are and what we need to do. We elect that people though, because we think they have authenticity and that they have character and that they're going to do something that we think is vital for the country. And whether it's in 2015, 2016, we wanted on the Republican side, somebody who was going to take a brick and throw through the plate class window of American politics. And that man was Donald Trump. But now we're going to be looking at him and saying, is this person up to the job? And do we think that if something terrible were to happen to it into the president, would we be comfortable with them stepping in? Would we have confidence in him? And this is Kamala Harris's problem. I mean, as bad as Joe Biden's numbers, our hers are worse because people can't look at her and say, yes, we have confidence that she has what it takes. Donald Trump would be well served by picking somebody that people would look at and say, well, you know, Donald Trump is running for a second term. So he's only got four more years and he's getting up there. And who would we have confidence in if something happened or if, you know, if I had to hand it off in 28 now, exactly. Yeah. So that usually these are announced what the week of the week before the convention, that is not until July Carl. That is a long time. When do you think, you know, the former president makes his announcement? Well, I don't know. He said he's already made a decision. I, I, I, I were him. I get that decision out there sooner rather than later. But on the other hand, there is something useful. I mean, the drama of going through a process is, is useful because you're, you're looking for reasons to have people pay attention to you. Now, it's not hard when you're Joe Biden and Donald Trump people pay attention to you. But it is a way to make it not just about you, but about your thought process and about this important individual who's going to play a big role in your administration. So our convention, the Republican convention is the middle of July. So I would surprise if this didn't take him another couple of, you know, months before he decides that it's a auspicious time to roll it out. But, you know, he's got his hands full right now. So I don't expect it will have, have this announced until late May or June or maybe even the middle of June. Well, then you and I will have plenty of time to reevaluate and have these conversations. Again, Carl Rae always appreciate our chats. Thanks so much. You bet. Thank you. He's also among the growing number of lawmakers retiring at the end of this term. We'll talk about both of those storylines. Until then, thanks for listening. I'm Jared Halpern. From Washington.\",\" I'm Charles Payne. I'm Martha McCallum.

The reality is that on a creative level, it's a strong showing for the best picture nominee, at least that part of it, gives people a reason to celebrate. And if Barbie makes younger people tune in, then all the better. President Biden opened the state of the union by telling us that like President Roosevelt did during World War II, he needs to wake up Congress and the American people about the threats we face. Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freed him and democracy been under salt at home as there are today. What makes our moment rare is the freedom of democracy, under attack at both at home and overseas. He said January 6th and lies about the 2020 election pose the gravest threat to our democracy since the Civil War. He moved on to abortion, saying former President Trump brags about the overturning of Roe versus Wade. Many of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. My God, what freedom else would you take away? Well, inflationary pressures were not a focus of his speech. He did argue that he's focused on bringing costs down overall, like the cost of prescription drugs. The President also proposed addressing the debt, at least in part, by taxing billionaires and corporations at a higher rate. Folks at home, does anybody really think the tax code is fair? Do you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion tax break? I sure don't. And the Republicans response to the State of the Union, Alabama Senator Katie Britt argued that the President can't talk about inflation or economic pressures because he's a career politician and is badly out of touch. It's been a minute since Joe Biden pumped gas, ran a carpool or even pushed a grocery cart. Meanwhile, the rest of us see our dollar and we know it doesn't go as far. So did the President's third State of the Union address connect with voters this election year? This is one of the most political speeches I can recall in the many, many states of the Union. I've witnessed and reported on in my career, but it was an effective speech, I think. That Biden showed off a feisty side. He showed off a political side where he was drawn contrasts on issues that Republicans, I think, have some vulnerability on whether it's abortion rights, whether it's the Republican party's view on Ukraine and funding for Ukraine's fight against Russia, defense against Russia as aggression, whether it's what happened on January 6th. Those were issues that Biden brought up at the outset and made Republicans including Speaker Johnson look a little bit uncomfortable and figured out when to stand, when to look by partisan, when not to. He sat down for almost the entire speech with a few scattered applause here and there, but look, this was a very political speech where Biden wanted to show off the fact that he is aggressively making his case for a second term and making the case that the economy and his stewardship of the economy is his pain dividends. He painted this very terribly stark picture that we're facing these unprecedented times. He said not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freed him and democracy have been under assault here at home and abroad, saying if you think Vladimir Putin will stop at Ukraine, you're wrong. He also said my predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6th and I won't do that. I guess that felt very, very dark and opening the state of the union with this message that were not strong, that they were in trouble. There was a lot of focus on national security, foreign policy, leaving with Ukraine and the fact that there's a fear that if Ukraine loses the war, Russia could threaten other NATO countries. So that was a very stark warning from the commander-in-chief. He also talked about the Middle East and the threat, the hostages that Hamas has held and murdered and talked about putting pressure on Israel as well to deal with the humanitarian crisis taking place in Gaza, talked about China and the threat it poses on numerous fronts. So this was a speech that was talked about the high stakes, not just on the international stage, but also domestically with the future of democracy in this country on the line. It just reminds you that after maybe concerns about foreign policy, this domestic issue is really going to be a big issue that Republicans are going to be facing throughout this election year. It's been a big issue since Roe v. Wade was overturned and the president talked about that. He gave the history lesson. He said that clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. He went on to talk about how reproductive rights were on the ballot in the one in 2022 and 2023 and says that they will win again in 2024. Listen, we have seen pretty dramatic shifts of the political landscape, especially in kind of suburban areas. And a lot of that happened in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade. And so listen, this is an area when you talk about reaching out to Haley Republicans or moderate Republicans or independent voters, it's an issue that has hit. And clearly it remains to be on the forefront. You have seen Republicans kind of move quickly to try and reaffirm IVF after the Alabama Supreme Court ruling. And so it makes a lot of sense that if this speech is largely intended to kind of be a referendum on his presidency and a list of why he deserves a second term that protecting access to abortion would be high on that list. Yeah. Jared, the president didn't really address inflation, but he did posit what he wanted to do in terms of the economy. And that is raised taxes, specifically in corporations and the billionaires. We've heard this before in his term. This may not end up being anything more than a proposal, right? But I didn't hear anything else about addressing, gosh, $34 trillion in debt. That was one of the first things Nikki Haley mentioned in her, you know, suspending her campaign speech. Well, when the president talks about raising taxes, especially in corporations, a minimum tax of 25% for billionaires, that is addressing the national debt. He talks about how much that would cut the deficit by. Now, obviously, you know, spending programs and other things probably are going to work against it. The other thing that he mentioned in the State of the Union that I had not heard before, at least kind of in a specific policy realm, was this idea of a temporary two-year tax deduction or tax benefit on mortgages. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's another way in which President Biden has kind of messaged inflation, right? He talks about inflation, kind of in a more macro sense about how much people are paying for things. So, he'll point to bringing down the cost of prescription drugs is fighting inflation. It's not really what inflation is after, but- Right, because that's more the Fed's purview, right? Sure, but he views exactly. But, you know, when you hear the president and you hear the White House kind of talk about inflation, they try and pivot a little bit to bringing down everyday costs. Junk fees. The president talked a little bit about that. He's made that a big part of his campaign. Talks about bringing down student loans. All of that in the context of bringing down everyday expenses, a tax deduction for mortgages that's temporary for two years, I think would kind of fit in that category. Josh, the border. The president tried to talk about it, right? He tried to pin things, turn things background on Republicans, accusing them of failing to pass this most recent border bill. But in talking about it, he pulled out the pin that Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green had given him when he entered the chamber, it had Lincoln Riley's name on it. And I wonder if in that moment it was actually Congresswoman Green who came away with the win there, because you could see her say to him from across the room as he was speaking, you let them in, meaning the undocumented migrants, one of whom is accused of killing. Lincoln Riley, the 22 year old nursing student in Georgia, what did you make of that moment? It was pretty intense. Yeah, look, border security immigration, that is the biggest vulnerability for President Biden. The fact that he sort of mangled her name, it was sort of fumbling along with trying to respond to Marjorie Taylor Green in real time during that moment. I'm not sure how that played to the average American voter who is concerned about the state of immigration and the fact that there are a lot of illegal immigrants that have just been flooded across the border and straining social services in a lot of communities across the country. You know, I think that Biden also had a really good moment on immigration where he outlined the bipartisan, or at least what was an originally bipartisan deal that James Langford, the Republican Senator from Oklahoma helped negotiate. Yeah. All the provisions in there that would help deal with border security, hardware judges to handle a lot of these cases. And Langford was seen on television saying, hey, it's true. That's true. That's right. That was right. And that was a powerful moment. And I think you could, would be surprised if you see that footage in a campaign ad for the Biden reelection campaign, for the Biden reelection. So border security is going to be a vulnerability for this White House. I'd only visited the US Mexico border for the second time and his entire presidency this month. The following Trump, they are being very reactive to the issue. But it's one that, you know, the Republicans biggest enemy, sometimes themselves. And the fact that they couldn't say yes to a deal that was frankly the most conservative immigration bill that had bipartisan support. I can remember in my time covering Congress. Finally, Josh, we heard from Katie Britt, Jr. Senator from Alabama for the Republican response. We talked about, but we've heard from a lot of Republicans about Biden's failures or they're perceived what they perceive as Biden's failures, having to with crime, the economy, inflation. But she is from Alabama and the state did just grapple with a court ruling that said frozen embryos for IVF can be considered children. I wondered, did you expect her to maybe talk more about women's reproductive issues? Or is that maybe for a later date? And she was just sort of setting the stage for high. I'm Katie Britt and you're going to hear more from me. Yeah, no, I look at the IVF ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court has been a political vulnerability for Republicans ever since the ruling came down. And even some of the more pro-life conservative Republican lawmakers have been distancing themselves from the decision. And even Alabama, the state legislature changed its law to ensure that those protections would remain even despite the ruling in the state. So she was not going to lean into, I think, what was becoming a problematic issue for the party, even for folks who are pro-life conservatives. But she, you know, look, I think she was on the national stage for the first time. She's on the list, as I've heard, to be Donald Trump's running mate. And I think this was her moment to see whether she could shine. I thought, you know, she had her moments, I think. These are never easy addresses to give as the response, the person responding to the president. And I can't think of many people who have done well with it. She was very dramatic. She hit all the high points on policy. But I think a lot of people might remember her more dramatic delivery as if they do remember anything from this state of the union response. And ultimately, look, I think, you know, I don't think she, I don't know if the needle got moved in any direction in so far as Trump's consideration of her as a vice presidential prospect. Very interesting. Thanks so much for joining us. Thanks, gentlemen. Thanks, Jess. Thanks, Jess. We'll discuss every single one of the Democrats' dumb ideas. Just kidding. It's only a three hour show. I'm Dana Perino. Join me for my brand new podcast, Perino on Politics. The 96th Academy Awards ceremony Sunday night. The number one box office movie last year, Barbie is one of the 10 best picture nominees. Hey, Barbie. Can I come to your house today? Sure. I don't have anything to play on just a giant blowout party with all the Barbies and plant choreography and a bespoke song. You should stop by. And now, Ken, her G is something you can't help but see. It came out of the same day as Oppenheimer about the development of the atomic bomb. Are we saying there's a chance that when we push that button, we destroy the world. Chances are near zero. Near zero. What do you want? What's here? You've loan zero would be nice. I know of no story as dramatic as the real life tale of Oppenheimer. He's involvement with the Manhattan Project in this crazy desperate race against the Nazis to harness the power of the atom for the first time. And where that led and how that defined the world we live in. No one's expected to win best director Oppenheimer's expected to win best picture. I mean, Oppenheimer seems to be the bomb, right? Sorry for the calm. It's the rare movie that dominated the box office and also had all the critics swimming and kind of also falls into that historical epic that Oscar voters loved so much. So it does seem pretty much a lot for the big one, but you never know. Look, a lot of great performances, Kellyan Murphy, obviously is the odds on favor to be best actor, Robert County Jr. Best supporting actor and just a lot of stars, a lot of great performances in there. And just again, a big story, a big spectacle. Let's go through the big awards and you can talk about whatever you want. You can say what you think will win, what you think should win, whatever. Best picture. We've pretty much covered director, I guess, Chris Nolan for Oppenheimer. Yeah, it seems like it's his year. He has been nominated before in this category for Doug Kirk and he's been nominated for other Oscars as well, but he's never won. He's always seemed like a bit of an outsider sometimes when you think about the Oscar establishment, but it does seem like this is the one it's going to be for him. It seems to have this venn diagram of quality and history and just sort of technical achievement. He's been able to marshal. And as you said, talk about sort of like a small army of amazing stars in this picture as well. Best picture, best director, Killian Murphy is going to win, I suppose. Has Robert Downey Jr. ever won an Oscar for acting? It does seem like the consummate Hollywood guy seems to be the one that's going to take the trophy this year. The acting awards, there does seem to be a bit of a horse race if you buy into the pundits predictions for best actress between Emma Stone and Lily Gladstone for killers of the flower moon. I mean, they've been sort of mech and mech all season for award season and those two really seem like the ones that everyone's like I am the closest. I mean, both like wildly different films, right? Yeah, poor things, right? Sort of a Frankenstein story. Yeah, it's like a Frankenstein beats Barbie type story. And of course, Killian the Flower Moon is, you know, about this super heavy chapter in American history and Lily Gladstone, you know, would be the first indigenous woman to win this award. So that also adds some some gravity to it. So it's kind of going to be, I guess it seems like what what Oscar voters seem like they want to reward. I mean, Emma Stone has seems like she's building this kind of career. It has, you know, been an Oscar race before too. So that could be part of it, you know, who knows though? It's like think about a netbedding, you know, Hollywood. She was nominated for the biopic Nia, like, you know, consummate Hollywood legend there. So you never know things like that could be like a spoiler type thing, but it does seem like Lily Gladstone and Emma are the ones to watch. But I'm going to guess that Lily's going to take it all. She won the Screen Actors Guild Award and that seems to be a good indicator since the, you know, actors have such a huge emphasis on the voting era. I think it's going to be really. Yeah, we talk about precursor awards, we're essentially the same voting bodies are, you know, like the acting awards, the director's guild awards, the whatever awards. It would make sense that would follow that those same people would win, the same winners would win at the Oscars too. Screenplay awards, anything else we should go through? You look at like the supporting roles for actors, you know, we mentioned Robert Downing Jr. likely a lot. I mean, I think the other one, of course, that does seem like a lot, but I think it would be, you know, one people are going to really support is to find Joy Randolph for the holdovers. I mean, she has just been sort of on fire throughout the award season too. And, you know, the holdovers are one of those Oscar movies that I think voters really like. It's kind of like a throwback film and, you know, feel good film and amazing scene if you know, the Paul Jimi audience becomes the dark horse to win over Killian Murphy or something. That would be a surprise, but the vine joy Randolph does seem like the one who's going to at least, you know, from a percentage standpoint, it seems to be the one that represents that film on the stage on that. Yeah. And I didn't not mention her out of disrespect. I think I just, it slipped my mind because it was, it seems like such a foregone conclusion that I, that I skipped over it. Let's talk about the business a little since you write about the business a little. Are we in sort of a reset time? The Oscars are time to celebrate the movies, but looking past that, production was set down, shut down for six months by the writer's strike and the actor's strikes. Where are we with that? Have movies been held back a while while production cats up is everything back to speed? Yeah, I mean, I think it's the Oscars are as great lens, you know, not only the celebrity and glitz get us watching, but it offers a moment of sort of retrospect. Looking at the business, you know, what happened the year before, almost going to happen ahead, I think the whole barbenheimer phenomenon, which was, you know, massive and really sort of a great thing to celebrate, also kind of hides the fact that things are in kind of scary tape right now in Hollywood. You mentioned the actor's strike, the writer's strike that shut down the business for, you know, much of the year last year. That essentially kind of emptied the pipeline or at least pushed things back in the pipeline, which are real deficit of big films coming. But more than that, it's like this kind of moment of like what are we doing in Hollywood? You know, spy the superhero genre is spiraling. It remains we seeing if that can kind of like climb back up to the heights that once had. And so that has put a lot of pressure on budgets across the board. So if it's harder to get things greenlit and things have to be sort of like a super package to get a greenlight from studios in the way that, you know, maybe a few years ago, they would have, you know, this is happening at a TV part and also in the film part as well too. So, you know, I think people are very concerned about what the year is going to hold. And it's easy to kind of hold onto these hits like, you know, the performance of the second dude that just came out and did quite well. But you look down the calendar and what else is coming out this year and it doesn't necessarily build that well for, I guess, Hollywood's complete bottom line. Yeah. And there have been maybe not bomb bombs, but certainly the Marvel movies, the, the bloom is off the rose there. Those movies for a lot of people are now feeling like homework instead of, you know, a fun thing to go do with the movies every six months or a year or whatever they come out. Some of the Disney movies have not done as well as they would have liked recently. And I wonder if, like you said, studios, including, well, maybe there's an opportunity for an Apple or an Netflix or an Amazon to jump in more, but are the other studios, the legacy studios going to be holding onto their wallets a little bit until things shake out. Yeah, I think that's the case. And in the meantime, they're still, you know, hanging their hats on the power of the franchise and, and, you know, that's been sort of a constant conversation in and around the business for so long. Definitely to be going anywhere. I mean, look down the line this year, you know, is Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes going to get people excited, you know, another Kingdom of the Planet of the Ace is another Godzilla movie going to get people excited. On one hand, you know, Barb and Hymer released Barbie, you know, showed the power IP. Like you could do something really creative with it, and you can do something that turns into, you know, the biggest movie in the world. But that's, doesn't mean that, you know, every, every IP movie that comes down the road is going to be like that. I mean, in case it actually, you know, it's newly the opposite. The formula, the formula is exposed in the formula tends to wear a thin too. So, I mean, on the plus side, you know, I feel like it was a good year for films. I mean, Barb and Hymer, I don't dominate the conversation, but if you run down the list of best picture nominees, you know, it's a pretty solid list, even though, you know, a lot of regular moviegoers probably haven't seen these films. You know, when you get down to things like the Zone of Interest and American Fiction and things like that, the reality is that, like, on a creative level, it's a strong showing for the best picture nominee, at least that part of it gives people a reason to celebrate. And if Barbie makes, you know, younger people tune in, then all the better. Yeah. I wonder if, so it was going to the movies. It's not going anywhere necessarily, but just, you know, just make that aspect of it will make less money for everyone. It'll be there for real fans of going to the movies, people who want to see something like anatomy of a fall or the Zone of Interest or past lives at a movie theater. Yeah. And, you know, depending where you sit, you know, literally where you sit, whether you want to sit in that theater or you want to sit at home, I mean, it puts consumers in the driver's seat. Like, that gives consumers the ultimate control. So, I think it's an interesting case when you look at this crop of, you know, if you always take the best picture category as like a petri dish of like, you know, a, or a, I guess, a cross-section of Hollywood right now. And you've got the mega mega theatrical blockbusters like Barbie and Oppenheimer. And then you have the ones down the list that people probably saw in their living rooms too. And I think that's sort of a, you know, a healthy, a healthy way to think about it from the consumer point of view. So, I mean, just funny. It's like it's, you know, generally, anytime you talk about this, this kind of question, it's glass half full, glass half empty and depending on which part of the business you're, looking at it from determines the answer to your question. But, you know, there's a lot of movies out there and there's a lot of ways to watch them that just matter making stuff, the regular movie viewers are there enough to click on or buy that ticket for them. Yeah, and I've got, look, I've got a lot of movies from last year that I didn't get around to that I might not have ever gotten around to. But now I can't, you know, however I want to do it. John Juergenson reporter on the town news desk at the washroom journal. John, thanks. My pleasure. Thanks so much. And now some good news with Tanya J powers. Faith snaps that she's always loved animals. So it makes sense that she'd pursue a career as a vet. Snap, who is 22 is legally blind, but hasn't let that slower down when chasing her dreams. She's been accepted into the Texas Tech University School of Veterinary Medicine. She says she and her twin brother were both born prematurely with limited vision. Snap has had a guide dog since high school and even worked at local animal clinics. She begins classes in August in hopes to pursue a career working as a mixed animal veterinarian, treating both large and small animals. Snap says she wants to remind people that no matter what challenge a person is facing, they should not give up on their dreams. She says, quote, anything is possible. Amp their foot assuming that everyone else is going to be in lockstep agreement with them because their grievance is the most important one that's ever been raised in our court of opinion. Well, that is not the case and they are doing a bad job at Kellogg of responding to the firestorm. They immediately should have rolled out cereal for dinner commercials. That would have been great showing people how to add cereal into a lovely balanced family meal that brings everyone together because everyone loves cereal. You can be lactose intolerant and still find ways to love cereal. You can have celiac disease like me and still find ways to love your breakfast treat at an inappropriate time of day. We all remember having breakfast for dinner as kids and it felt like we were breaking some rule like we were thumbing our nose at the great authoritarian figure in the sky, but you're not. You're just giving your body what it wants at a time when it really needs it and sure Kellogg's and other companies may be guilty of shrink flation meaning they have the same size packaging with fewer contents inside. They can remedy that themselves. But this one is actually a win for consumers and manufacturers alike in order to celebrate. I think tonight you should have cereal for dinner, but instead of milk, baby, just drown in champagne and toast yourself for having such a great idea. I'm going to have more on this in a longer format on my podcast Kennedy saves the world. Howdy Podcast former federal prosecutor and four-term US Congressman from South Carolina brings you a one-of-a-kind podcast.\",\"A threat to Apple's app store dominance as a new EU tech law comes into force. This new law is pushing Apple to open up parts of its closed app ecosystem. So in the EU, users are going to get a screen that says, hey, do you want to use Safari? Or do you want to use any of these other browsers? Plus, Chinese exports surge as the West ready's tariffs to stem a flood of cheap goods. And the US sounds the alarm over the situation in Haiti as warlords threaten to take over the country and trigger mass migration. It's Thursday, March 7th. The world's largest tech companies will soon be waking up to a new regulatory landscape in Europe as the EU's digital markets act begins to apply to them at midnight tonight. The sweeping law is aimed at boosting competition from smaller companies. Those journal tech reporter Sam Schackner told me one of its biggest near-term impacts could be on the rival reap between Apple and Google. This new law is pushing Apple to open up parts of its closed app ecosystem, which is really one of the cornerstones of its business model. It's going to be allowing third-party app stores for the first time, at least in the EU, and it's going to start allowing alternative ways to do in-app payments across the EU. These are two things that the company really was loathed to do. They lobbied against the third-party app stores, calling it a huge security risk. On the flip side, you have Google, which already allows you to use alternative app stores. It already allows you to install apps not through their Play Store. In fact, Google actually lobbied for this requirement to be put into the digital market act. Sam, there are some other ways that Google could benefit from this law. Totally. Google actually could take advantage of an element of the law that requires companies like Google and Apple to give users a choice for competing services in certain areas. One of them is web browsers. If they offer a web browser, they have to allow a choice for competing web browsers. In the EU, users are going to get a screen that says, hey, do you want to use Safari, which is Apple's default the browser they make, or do you want to use any of these other browsers? Google's Chrome browser will be on that list. It's possible, or even likely, that they'll pick up a slightly higher percentage of Chrome browser users in the EU on iPhones. Meanwhile, in Washington, House lawmakers have introduced legislation that could ban TikTok in the United States. If its owner, Chinese internet company Bite Dance doesn't divest itself from the video sharing app. The bill's Republican backer said that America's foremost adversary had no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States. While its Democratic backer described the bill as giving the President tools to defend American security and privacy. A TikTok spokesperson said the bill would trample on First Amendment rights and affect its 170 million American users. Earlier attempts by lawmakers to ban TikTok haven't come to fruition. China has kicked off 2024 with a surge in exports, setting it up for a backlash from Western economies. The 7.1% rise in exports in January and February, top-to-cottomest expectations and follows a much weaker 2.3% export growth reading in December. The data comes as Republican senators earlier this month proposed new tariffs on Chinese-made cars in order to stop what Florida's Marco Rubio described as Beijing's attempt to, quote, flood the U.S. market with artificially cheap vehicles. However, as journal reporter Ben Dumbett explains Beijing isn't likely to curtail those exports as it hopes to hit ambitious growth expectations of around 5% that it's set this week. Yeah, no doubt the latest numbers are impressive. Export activity has been up and down during COVID, it was particularly strong but slow dramatically as the world reopened. That said, this recent evidence of return of growth and export activity won't be enough, even if it continues. Domestic demand for goods and services also needs to strengthen simply because Chinese economy is so big that it can't rely on one source of demand alone. And that one source of demand may also weaken again in March with Chinese officials issuing a warning that exports are likely to soften this month. A Hoothy attack on a Barbados flagged ship off Yemen yesterday has killed three people on board according to the ship's owner. It marks the first loss of life on a commercial vessel since the rebel group began attacking ships in the Red Sea region in late November, upending the shipping industry's ability to travel through one of the world's busiest waterways. And that unrest is also now threatening key internet cables with the majority of internet traffic between Europe and East Asia running through the Red Sea. Telecom's reporter Drufits Gerald says that although the narrow street has always posed risks for telecom infrastructure, one recent attack by Iran-backed Hoothies managed to meaningfully worsen web service in India, Pakistan and parts of East Africa. There were at least three cables that were cut last month. One of the companies responsible for these cables said that their expectation is that they will be able to start repairs in April at the earliest. Of course, that timeline could change because the area is subject to rocket attacks frequently. Any ship going out there for repairs will need permits from the country where it is doing the work. Now Yemen is the midst of a civil war, so it will need permits not only from the Hootie government, but the internationally recognized government that holds the rest of the country. So that is going to be a consideration that these cable repair ships are going to have to think about as they enter these dangerous waters. Another aspect is just insurance is extremely expensive and fixing those cables is not something that's done in a day. The majority of internet cables around the world lie at the bottom of the sea with land installation posing far greater risks and costs. The regional efforts signal rising concern about Haiti's security situation and the potential that escalating gang warfare there could spark mass migration out of the country. We are not calling on him or pushing for him to resign, but we are urging him to expedite the transition to an empowered and inclusive governance structure that will move with urgency to help the country prepare for a multinational security support mission to address the security situation and pave the way for free and fair elections. Henri has thus far resisted calls to set up a transitional government or hold new elections. Back in Washington, House lawmakers are closing in on the end of a months-long fight over funding the government after approving a package of six spending bills. That move completes the budget process for a slew of federal agencies, including the agriculture, justice, transportation and interior departments, and sets the stage for final negotiations over the rest of the year's budget. The spending package agreed to yesterday is expected to receive a Senate vote by week's end. And President Biden is today set to propose raising taxes on large companies as part of several announcements expected in his State of the Union address. The plans include raising the corporate minimum tax from 15 to 21 percent and could make tax policy a major contention point in the coming election. Many of the tax cuts signed into law by Republicans in 2017 are set to expire at the end of next year, with Biden calling those tax cuts in unfair giveaway to Americans who can afford to pay more. While Republicans say the 2017 tax law has been an economic success. Coming up as Scandinavia attracts more foreign investment than anywhere else, we'll look at why the world's biggest economy the U.S. is lagging behind. That story, after the break. But that's not all. So we know they definitely have something for you. That's amazon.com slash What's News. It's just that easy. Investors are pouring money into Scandinavian countries more than anywhere else. A new report from the Melcon Institute has found that Denmark is the most attractive country for foreign direct investment on a per capita basis, followed by Sweden, Finland, and then the United States in fourth place. So why is the world's largest economy not attracting the most investment? Our Kate Bullivan spoke to Maggie Sweetech, lead author of the Melcon Institute's Global Opportunity Index, which looks at which economic and financial conditions will foster and attract FDI. Maggie, before we look at how the U.S. performed, what is it about Denmark that makes it the top country for people to invest in? So in the case of Denmark, it really is a country that is benefiting from a very strong business perception and from strong economic fundamentals. And so focusing on this other category, economic fundamentals for a moment, this is a category in which we include three different subcategories, work for talent, economic performance, and a future environment for growth. Measures that are related to the ESG type of concerns that investors had had in recent years. So agricultural land, air pollution, carbon emissions, also factors related to governance and inclusivity, social inclusivity, mobile broadband subscriptions, mobile phone subscribers, percentage of woman and government. And those are all indicators that are included in the future environment for growth. And then Mark and Finland and Sweden actually all do quite well in that particular subcategory. And that is really what tends to prop them up to the top of the index. That's super interesting. And on the other hand, the U.S. came in at fourth place. Why is that? It's also be clear in recent years, FDI to the United States has actually increased. It jumped around 30% in between 2018 and 2022. So it's doing well. When it comes to things that could do better, I would say that it's really these economic fundamentals where the United States tends to perform slightly less than the average advanced economy. The economic performance, it's really it's a high central government debt that is driving the country down and indicators in terms of factors such as the future environment for growth, the CO2 emissions remain relatively high in the United States, which is a factor that tends to drive it down. So these are still aspects that the United States could improve, but it is still attracting significant capital investment. So the countries that attract the most FDI are consistently advanced economies, but your report also revealed an interesting shift in investment flows into emerging and developing economies. What we see is really in recent years, there has been a movement of capital into Latin America. And really there's two countries that capture more than 60% of foreign direct investment in flows into Latin America and those are Brazil and Mexico. And that is because Brazil, it has a relatively strong foreign emerging country financial services sector and in particular high financial access for its population. In the case of Mexico, it really benefits from both its geographic location, it's border with the United States, but it also actually is one of the emerging and developing nations with the strongest economic openness. It's by the other investment treaties that have really allowed capital to enter the country. Okay, so China was weighed down the list at number 39. What does this tell us about how China is performing on the global stage? Being a number 39 for a country that remains according to the IMF classified as an emerging and developing economy is actually not that low. However, what I would say about China is that certainly in recent years in the post-pandemic period, there has been a decrease in capital inflows into China. So in 2022, for the first time, more capital exited China than entered. And that in general, drove down the capital inflows into the entire emerging and developing Asian region that may not become a long-term pattern. But for now what we are seeing is this short-term movement moving away from China and into Latin America. Okay, Maggie. So what are the lessons learned here? So institutions matter having a strong institutional framework matters, having strong economic fundamentals, matters. These are all things that we observe among our top 20 country ranks in the global opportunity index. These top 20 countries really attract around 60% of capital inflows generally around the world. That is, Manita is establishing new factories, new businesses that could generate work. It has been found that an increase in foreign direct investment is correlated with job generation, especially formal jobs for people that may be working in the informal economy and that would be looking to move into the formal economy. Now is it that's going to be a change that happens overnight? No. But in the long term, it could have effects on a person's day-to-day life. That was Maggie Sweetech, lead author of the Milkin Institute's Global Opportunity Index. Maggie, thanks so much for being here. Thank you so much, pleasure. And that is What's News for Thursday Morning. Today's show was produced by capable of it and hadymoyer. We will be back tonight with a new show. And until then, thanks for listening. A U.S. espionage investigation finds communication devices on Chinese cranes at U.S. ports. This is coming amid a backdrop of great bipartisan concerns in both the Democratic and Republican Party about Chinese technology and Chinese supply chains infiltrating the United States, and the potential for disruptions or risks in the event of a serious conflict with Beijing. And a forensic DNA scandal threatens thousands of criminal cases in Colorado. It's Thursday, March 7. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. The findings of a congressional investigation of Chinese-built cargo cranes at U.S. ports is raising concerns the foreign machines may pose a covert national security risk. We report exclusively that the U.S. has found communications equipment that doesn't appear to support normal operations, including in some cases cellular modems that could be accessed remotely. That's according to congressional aides and documents. Welcome back Dustin. Thanks for having me. So what exactly does the equipment that was found in this investigation do? Well, there are a lot of questions that congressional investigators are still trying to get to the bottom of. But essentially, these are modems built within the cranes that could allow for remote access and might not necessarily be nefarious in their use. In fact, modems are often included on these types of cranes and they can be used to sort of support mobile diagnostic tests and monitoring of how the cranes are functioning at the ports. But what seems to be alarming lawmakers and others that have learned about this is that at least in some of the cases, the U.S. ports that have these modems did not actually ask for them in their contracts. They might not be doing something suspicious or nefarious, but the fact that they were seemingly not actually being used for anything by the ports and do have this remote capability of being accessed at least is giving a lot of concern for lawmakers in Congress and prompting them to investigate and ask more questions. What are the major concerns U.S. officials have? So the concerns are twofold. One, there's sort of a risk or a fear that these cranes could be sort of tracking what's going in and out of port for normal importations or those maybe that are military related and that by tracking sort of the shipping. There could glean certain insights about sort of what's going on in the U.S. with our economy and with our military movements and that sort of thing. The second concern is sort of a more, I guess, Hollywood style scenario where these cranes could actually be sort of disrupted or taken off line if they sort of came baked with some sort of hidden software that could then be activated. Likely in a conflict with China over Taiwan or something like that and then once again, that would sort of be a rather calamitous to have our ports no longer able to function anymore. This is especially concerning for people because about 80% of cranes throughout the United States at our ports are Chinese furnished by a state owned company in China called ZPMC. How is China and that state owned company responding to those concerns? ZPMC has not responded to our requests for comments. The Chinese government says that this is simply paranoia on the part of the United States and that this is basically a form of economic protectionism that's trying to decouple China from the U.S. economy and sort of favor domestic solutions. That was sort of the response especially after last month the Biden administration took the step of announcing they were going to invest over $20 billion over the next five years in replacing these Chinese cranes with those that are going to be built domestically. How else might the U.S. respond given these concerns? It remains to be seen. The $20 billion investment was a really big step. The administration has said that they remain concerned and are continuing to investigate the crane issue. This is coming amid a backdrop of great bipartisan concerns in both the Democratic and Republican Party about Chinese technology and Chinese supply chains infiltrating the United States and the potential for disruptions or risks in the event of a serious conflict with Beijing. So there's a lot happening across many industries to try to address the perceived risks of Chinese technology within American society. And separately the House Homeland Security Committee said that it is continuing to investigate the specific issue and that they're planning to release or finish a report in April that hopefully will give more public attention to the concerns that they have about Chinese cranes. Coming up, a forensic DNA scandal in Colorado is throwing the state's justice system into chaos, threatening thousands of criminal cases. More after the break. Hey, what's news fans? Listen up. But that's not all. So we know they definitely have something for you. And it's already included in your prime membership. That's Amazon.com slash what's news. It's just that easy. A scandal is unfolding in the field of forensic DNA testing. An expert say it could be one of the largest in history. For nearly three years, Yvonne Missy Woods was Colorado's star forensic scientist and her work was considered a gold standard by colleagues. But she abruptly resigned in November. On the same day, the state's Bureau of Investigation said it had discovered anomalies in her work during an internal review. And that it was launching a criminal probe. The state said it would need to review and retest about 3,000 DNA samples would handle. And public defenders estimate thousands of cases could be affected. Our enterprise reporter Dan Frosh has more. You have district attorney's offices all over the state who are having to sift through hundreds of cases where Missy was listed as a witness or a potential witness. And figure out to what extent she handled DNA evidence in those cases. You have the Colorado Bureau investigation conducting a probe into Missy's handling of DNA evidence for the last 29 years. And trying to figure out what exactly she did and what impact her alleged misconduct may have on cases. And then you have defense lawyers who are trying to figure out if their clients cases, some of which have long since been adjudicated, were impacted as well. So together you have sort of a chaotic moment in Colorado's criminal justice system that could potentially impact thousands of cases. An attorney for Wood says she's cooperating with the investigation and that she stands by the reliability and integrity of her work. Hamas has paused his participation in talks aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza. Officials familiar with the discussions say the group's leader is demanding Israel commit to discussing a permanent stop in fighting, which puts him at odds with other Hamas leaders. Israel has said a collapse in talks would prompt it to move ahead with a military operation against Rafa, which it sees as Hamas's last major stronghold in Gaza. U.S. and Arab officials have been pushing Israel and Hamas to agree to a six week truce ahead of the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Reporter Ben Solomon documented it on the ground. The journal found these roads are often being built in just a few days, partially with money from the Israeli government. According to videos the journal verified and local witnesses, much of this work is being done with unmarked construction vehicles, often under armed guard. Settlements are illegal under international law, but legal under Israeli law. Over the years, some members of the movement began creating new small encampments known as outposts, which are illegal under both Israeli and international law. Now researchers say since October 7th, the pace of outposts and illegal road construction is surging. Israeli researcher and activist Jor Etkis has combed the West Bank tracking expansions like these since 2002. Roads are connecting outposts with settlements, they're connecting outposts with outposts, they're connecting outposts with agricultural area, and there are also important borders which every Palestinian understand that they cannot cross, geographic dominance. This is exactly what these all settlements outpost roads are all about. This is what it's all about. Many settlers say roads are built to avoid confrontations with Palestinians. The Israeli government says if it sees illegal construction, it takes action, though the government declined to review the journal's findings. You can see our video investigation on WSJ.com. We'll leave a link in the show notes. In other news, the Justice Department plans to pay whistleblowers who tell prosecutors about corporate crime. This adds a new incentive to attract more tipsters to aid the government. They'd be paid out of money that defendants forfeit when they settle criminal charges or a sentence after a guilty plea or conviction. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the Department plans to launch a pilot program later this year. whistleblowing has already become a lucrative if risky profession for some insiders. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission operates similar programs. In his second day of testimony on Capitol Hill, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers the central bank is not far from being able to cut interest rates. Powell repeated his view that the Fed was looking for greater confidence that inflation was returning to its 2% target as we reported yesterday. But today he went a step further by qualifying how soon the Fed might get there. Yesterday, Powell had signaled that the Fed wasn't considering a rate cut at its next meeting on March 19th and 20th. That shifted attention to whether the central bank might be in a position to cut rates around the middle of the year. President Biden will deliver his state of the Union address tonight at 9 p.m. Eastern time. He's expected to talk about his economic agenda and call for unity amid a divided government. The speech will give Biden what will likely be his largest televised audience before this summer's democratic national convention. The US government has designated him as wrongfully detained. You can follow our live coverage of the state of the Union at WSJ.com. And finally, Bike theft is a profitable business that's become more lucrative with the arrival of expensive electric bikes. According to the Bike Registry Project 529, almost 2 million bikes are stolen each year, costing cyclists almost a billion dollars. That's up from 500 million dollars a decade ago. Police say they take Bike theft seriously, but often lack the manpower to tackle the problem. So a cohort of amateur detectives in cities like Minneapolis, Minnesota, Portland, Oregon, and Burlington, Vermont have taken it upon themselves to find stolen bikes and return them to their owners. They're pretty committed and very creative. You know, they're different people, you know, different ages. Mike Pavlovich has seen a lot. He has a military background. Generally, kind of meet people after they put up the bikes or sale on anything from Craig Blip to Facebook Marketplace. And then he'll meet a thief and basically just confirm that the bike is the one he'd after. And then just calmly tell him, hey, that's my bike. Do you want to meet a call of police? You just want to hand it over. And often the alleged thief just handed over. He had a pussle with one guy for a bike and had to use a bear spray on him to get away clean on the bike. He had a lot of these interactions with people and it's how they get to real adrenaline rush for these guys. Yikes. I remember the days when having a bike lock was all you'd need. Mike's local police department says it commends residents for stepping up to improve safety in their communities, but it doesn't endorse aggressive tactics that put anyone in harm's way. And that's what's news for this Thursday afternoon. Today's show was produced by Pierre BNMA and Anthony Vancey with supervising producer Michael Kissmedis. We'll be back with a new show tomorrow morning. Thanks for listening.\",\" Can't say I'm surprised, Russia's electoral commission says Vladimir Putin won yet another term as president. After which for the first time he addressed the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Donald Trump defended the January 6th attackers on the Capitol. You see the spirit from the hostages and that's what they are as hostages. We'll put some of that rhetoric into context and explain why it's words matter. And two voter concerns about Vice President Kamala Harris as she campaigns for President Biden. His age and her readiness. She's tender to him for better our powers. Stay with us.

It's shaping up to be another Biden Trump showdown. On the It's Been A Minute podcast, what this deja vu does for our feelings towards democracy. 87% Russia's electoral commission says that's how much of the vote Vladimir Putin won giving him another six year term as president. Well, that's what they say. Putin is thanking citizens of his country for their support and trust after Russia's three day presidential election ended. Western countries and Russia's opposition are saying the vote was neither free nor fair, but it's not like it's a least since Putin's chief political opponent is death. Good morning, Charles. Good morning. So I understand that Putin held a late night press conference after the vote. What did he say? Yeah, you know, going into this election, it was clear the Kremlin sought not just this massive victory, but a historic turnout. One that would show that Russians were united behind Putin, despite more than two years of war in Ukraine. When speaking last night, Putin took a victory lap. He rejected charges. The elections were undemocratic. And said Russians had rallied behind him when confronted by threats from Ukraine and a hostile West. Let's listen. So here Putin says when we're consolidated, it's clear that no matter who wants to intimidate us or suppress us, nobody has ever succeeded, not in history, not now and not ever. And we saw Putin double down on the war effort, saying Russia would reach its goals in Ukraine and even suggesting Moscow may take more territory than it already has what Putin called a buffer zone to prevent against Ukrainian rocket attacks into Russia proper. He also made dark warnings, not for the first time, that NATO's deepening involvement in Ukraine risked a global catastrophe, World War III in his words. And of course, that comes as some in the West have questioned the wisdom of continuing to give arms to Ukraine. So you could look at it as him trying to tip the scales in that debate. I understand that Putin finally addressed the death of Alexei Navalny. That's of course the Russian opposition leader who died in a remote prison column last month. What did he say about that? Yeah, he did. He even saved Navalny's name, something that Putin very rarely does. Putin called Navalny's death a sad event, but something that happens in prisons. He also confirmed press reports that he had signed off on a prisoner's swap that would have freed Navalny. On the condition Putin said that the opposition leader never returned to Russia, but Putin said unfortunately, Navalny died before the deal went through, calling it that's life. Now must be said that Navalny's allies and family have relayed a similar story, but with a key plot difference. They argue that Putin ordered Navalny's murder to take him off the table from any trade. So turning back to the vote itself, do you have a sense of what Russians think of the result in and also other countries? It's been kind of a split screen experience, depending on your politics. There are certainly Russians, many of them older, who say Putin won because he's the best candidate. He's a strong leader. But they choose to ignore, of course, fellow citizens who say that this race took place in a repressive environment with state and control of media and only hand-chosen rival candidates allowed to run. Meanwhile, internationally, there are all these divisions. Western countries condemn the vote. Electron monitoring groups have raised a host of concerns over vote rigging to give Putin this record landslide. And yet Russia will say it has plenty of friends out there, powerful nations like China, congratulated Putin on his win, and so did North Korea. Charles, thank you. Thank you. Former President Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric is making news again, and it's not because of some big policy idea. This is for his words at a campaign rally, which we will hear and discuss. Trump spoke near Dayton, Ohio, over the weekend, and this is the way he described people who went to prison for attacking the United States Capitol in 2021. You see the spirit from the hostages, and that's what they are as hostages. Trump often repeats a story about other countries emptying their prisons to send people to the United States. His campaign has never been able to name such a country, but Trump talked about the people he imagined coming. If you call them people, I don't know if you call them people. In some cases, they're not people in my opinion. He also repeated a campaign promise focused on asylum seekers and people in this country illegally. We're going to get them out fast. We're going to have the largest deportation effort in history. Those are the kinds of remarks Trump makes at rally after rally. Over the weekend, he also said something about a bloodbath. Hey there. Well, let's start with that bloodbath remark. What did it mean? And why do you think it got so much attention? Well, so Trump was talking about China, potentially opening car plants in Mexico and then trying to sell those cars in the United States. Let's take a listen to part of what he said. We're going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you're not going to be able to sell those cars. If I get elected, now if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole, that's going to be the least of it. It's going to be a bloodbath for the country. That'll be the least of it. You know, so it's pretty clear he was talking about the auto industry and his campaign clarified to say as much in a statement after the event. But you know, this is what Trump does. You know, he throws out this kind of violent graphic language. He knows it's going to get a rise out of people, especially on the left and generate headlines. Then he can wave his hand and blame the media for creating some false narrative. You know, but while many are litigating what he meant by those comments, going less noticed in the same rally as Trump standing there and saluting January 6 rioters, calling them hostages and patriots, and saying their prosecutions are disgrace. I understand, Trump also said something this week about reproductive rights that's getting a lot of attention specifically about the possibility of a federal ban. What was that? Look, a lot of things were done with row by killing it. Number one, we brought it back to the court. Of course, your addresses to the Supreme Court have made that possible. They did. And here they did something that from a lot of standpoints is extremely good. You know, the practical results, obviously, of overturning row has meant that states have passed extremely restrictive laws banning abortion. Just put Republicans on the defensive in election after election since the Dobbs ruling two years ago as Trump himself acknowledged, but given his appointments to the court are the reason for overturning row, it's going to be hard for him to get out of the same box as party has been in. And Democrats are happy to remind people of that, promising to spend millions of dollars on ads and hoping they can mobilize voters that they so desperately need. Okay, in the time we have lived, let's talk about the Democrats. They do need to start moving voters in president Biden's direction. How is that going? He's got a lot of work to do. I mean, he's behind in swing states and in the average of the polls, his approval rating right now is lower at this point than any president seeking reelection in the past 50 years or more. And he's fighting a two front battle, one from Trump and one from third party threats. It's all making for a lot of tension among Democrats who can understand why with comments like Trump is making and the policies he's proposing that more voters at this point don't see Trump as more of an urgent threat. Domenico, thank you. You're welcome. Sticking with the Democrats now, Vice President Kamala Harris is also facing a lot of scrutiny this election year. She'll be on the ballot this fall alongside president Biden and she's making high profile campaign stops. Last week in Minnesota, Harris toured a clinic that provides abortions, which is believed to be a first for any president or vice president. But on Saturday, she will walk the halls of the high school in Parkland, Florida that was the site of a mass shooting in 2018. Good morning, Asma. Good morning. So talk about the vice president out on the trail. What's she been up to? Well, she's been out a lot more than two dozen trips just this year. You know, one of her primary jobs this campaign season is to travel the country for Biden. That's what Jim Messina told me. He ran Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign. The vice president serves as the president's chief surrogate, especially in the battleground states. What I learned when I ran President Obama's campaign is that, you know, the president has a day job. Crisis has come up and they just cannot campaign as much as their opponent. And so in steps, the vice president. So in talking about issues like abortion rights and like gun violence prevention, which is obviously the focus and visiting parkland, who is she trying to reach? She's trying to energize the base of the Democratic party. The Biden campaign believes that Harris has a unique demographic appeal. Take a listen to Harris's chief of staff for the campaign. She'll it makes. She's really been mobilizing a lot of the voters that we need, you know, especially in the Biden Harris coalition, like young people, women, voters of color. And Michelle, you know, this is something I hear from a lot of people. The thing is that both Harris and Biden, though, broadly have low poll numbers. And so her job is to mobilize the activists in the party. To that point, you know, Harris has held some 80 events on reproductive rights since the Roe vs. Wade decision was overturned. And this I will say is kind of the main issue where you really see her take a lead over President Biden. But I think that's the reason why I think the president is not going to be able to do that. And I think that's why I think the president is going to be able to do that. And I think that's why I think the president is going to be able to do that. And I think that's why I think the president is going to be able to do that. That's why I think the president of the president is going to be able to do that. Because he would be able to follow this. He would be able to do that. And then what he would want to do is to continue over President Biden. But I think one thing to keep in mind when you talk about crain and mobilize activists is that that has become more complicated in recent months because of protests about the war in Gaza. And also we've talked a lot about voters concerns about Biden's age on this program. And a lot of media outlets. Although I do have to point out again, he's only four years older than his opponent Donald Trump. out campaigning. Yeah, Enemieshell, it is the underlying subtext to everything. And so, you know, how she navigates somewhat polarizing issues, whether that's the war in the Middle East or issues like immigration, I would say matter more than normal because she is running alongside the oldest president in American history. And so if something happens to him, she'd take his place. She has said that she's ready, but it's not just about saying it. It is about convincing people that that is true, without actually having the power to set the policies that she's talking about. I spoke to an aide, a former vice president, Mike Pence's Devano Malley. And he argues that because the job of the VP is somewhat limited, you've got to convince people you're competent, not necessarily by what you do, but through your words, how you communicate. And Republicans like O'Malley say Harris gets tripped up in her words. So part of the Democrats' reelection bid will require them tackling this head-on, because the flip side to the Joe Biden age question is the Kamala Harris competency question. Asma, thank you. Always good to talk to you. And that's up first for Monday, March 18th. I'm Michelle Martin. And I'm Steve Inskip.

In my view, he's hurting Israel more than helping Israel by making the rest of the world it's contrary to what Israel stands for, and I think it's a big mistake. Netanyahu responded yesterday telling Politico that he didn't know exactly what Biden was referring to, but that quote, \\\"If he meant by that I'm pursuing private policies against the wish of the majority of Israelis and that this is hurting the interests of Israel, then he's wrong on both counts.\\\" Journal correspondent Dov Lieber told me that the increasing frostiness between Biden and Netanyahu comes amid a failure to secure a ceasefire before the start of the Muslim Holy month of Ramadan and as a US military ship sets sail from Virginia to facilitate the flow of aid in tag Gaza. Another reason we might see these two fighting in public is that they both have a political interest to fight in public now. For Netanyahu, many in his base and his right wing like to see him standing up to foreign powers, standing up for Israel's interests. And for Biden, it's no secret that there are many parts in the Democratic Party and especially the progressive side who want this war to be over yesterday. And to see Biden scrapping it with Netanyahu in public demanding that the Israelis do more to get humanitarian aid into Gaza is potentially a good look for Biden for his political base.  So Dov, is it just posturing then, or could we be seeing a meaningful wedge being driven here between these two allies? This is a very, very good and important question. President Biden, in his interview that you quoted, he seemed to hint that he could in some ways block the flow of offensive weaponry from the United States to Israel. Though he wasn't very clear about that threat, although he intimated that the United States could do that while at the same time he said he would never leave the Israeli people alone. Maybe they feel comfortable taking knots at each other because they've known each other for so long, but we will have to see how this personal relationship unfolds in the coming weeks. It could potentially affect the outcome of this war and how things look moving forward. In Washington, a congressional crackdown on TikTok has spun into high gear ahead of an expected vote Wednesday on a bill that would force its Beijing based parent ByteDance to divest itself from the app or see it banned in the US. While ByteDance has said separating the US portion of its app wouldn't be practical and would undercut its global appeal, US tech and media titans have nevertheless been circling. Former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has reportedly expressed interest in buying TikTok if ByteDance agrees to sell and is looking for partners for a deal. Any price tag is expected to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. And US markets have found their new champions, and it's not big tech. With heavyweights like Apple and Tesla sinking this year, a larger group of companies has helped to power recent gains and lead the S&P 500 to a fresh record last week. And our Europe markets editor Katy Barnato has the details. We have some research by Bespoke Investment Group, which suggests that almost 1\\u002f5 of stocks in the S&P 500 hit new 52-week highs recently. That's the largest share since May 2021. And I think it potentially alleviates investors' concerns that it's just an AI bubble driving a few specific stocks, and that's going to burst. Investors will get a fresh look at stocks prospects with the release of US consumer-price data tomorrow and earnings this week from the likes of Oracle, Kohls, and Adobe. Journal workplace reporter Chip Cutter recently learned about an HR issue playing out at network equipment giant Cisco Systems. The relationship between a manager and their new hire had gotten off to a tense start, though neither could put a finger on exactly why. And so the company turned to generative artificial intelligence. And after uploading chat logs between the two employees, the software quickly detected that the new hire who was seeking extra clarity on their assignments was actually making their boss feel unheard as they kept on fielding the same questions over and over. And as Chip reports, Cisco is far from alone among major US employers in turning to AI in a trend that could have major consequences for the labor market. Chip, what should we make of this story from Cisco? It's either a huge boon for the folks on their HR team that they can now turn to AI to problem solve things, or quite worrying because until recently, this would've been solely the job of a human to handle. Well, that's exactly right. You'd have people who are really skilled at figuring out the source of workplace tensions, understanding why people might not exactly be sort of working well together, what the issue might be. And here, software was able to really give these two people an answer, which helped them then work better together. And so I think all of this is then fueling a lot of predictions, some ominous, some optimistic about what gen AI does to corporate roles. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has said that AI might require future generations to only work three and a half days a week. The venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, on the other hand, also has said that AI might be able to do 80% of the jobs that exist today over the next 10 years. And so it raises bigger questions about what happens in society.   Yeah, especially, Chip, as a lot of companies are out there testing AI to see what kind of opportunities it could unlock for them, how much of a job killer it might be. What have they found out so far?So some companies have really gone all in on AI, for example, deploying tools that help their engineers write software code where a lot of companies are beginning to roll gen AI into its call centers or contact centers, just wanting people who are answering customer questions to more easily point to policies or responses, whatever it might be to speed up that job. Certainly it's leading companies to either cut jobs or say, \\\"We definitely don't need to hire as many people going forward.\\\" So I think there's then a bigger question of beyond call centers, beyond coders, what does this really look like? And we're starting to see companies test this in a range of different corporate roles. So in marketing, for example, some teams are creating photos or marketing campaigns using gen AI. There's one company, that's the insurance company, Allstate, they have been experimenting with a tool that would allow the company to produce internal training videos in the voice and likeness of the company's HR chief or other people. The idea would be to do more sort of quick on the job training with just a few text prompts. And then other companies are analyzing earnings reports from their rivals and their competitors to better understand what's happening to prep for their own investor calls. So it's a real range here, and it just shows that companies are thinking, \\\"Hey, what could gen AI do to change how a lot of white collar professionals work?\\\"Yeah, a lot of different potential applications there. In terms of the quality of the work that these companies are seeing when they engage AI on all those projects, what are they finding? Yeah, so I think one of the examples here that it's interesting is from a company called Ecolab. It's an infection prevention company. Their CEO told me that they've tried this in investor relations and their finance team. And so they would use gen AI to parse earnings call transcripts from competitors, but they also then use it to create their own quarterly calls. And so they'll look back to see what the company said a year ago, for example, what they might want to emphasize this time around. And the CEO said that the gen AI analysis is kind of mixed. In one case, gen AI inserted the CEO's predecessor's name in the role. The system is sort of, he said about 60% right, 40% wrong. And so what they're doing is they kind of have a gen AI version of all of this, and then they do it the old way too. I think what that showing inside a lot of companies is that it's not ultimately a huge productivity saver just yet. Some real issue there with accuracy of course, but there are also much bigger hurdles. There are costs. For example, I mean some software charges licensing fees of $30 per user per month, so that can get pretty expensive if you're a company with 100,000 employees if everybody was going to get access to something like this. But I think security is also something that really trips a lot of executives up. There are real fears of putting proprietary data or customer data into some of these large language models. Certainly there are real concerns about privacy here. Regulations remain in flux. This is all stuff that gives executives pause. And then there's also just the human adoption piece. Getting people to change their behavior takes work too. That's another sort of potential roadblock to more people using gen AI in their everyday roles. Chip, thanks so much for bringing us this story. Thanks for having me. Coming up, the US Justice Department launches a criminal probe into the midair blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight. And Oppenheimer cleans up at the Oscars. We've got those stories and more after the break. Over the weekend, the Journal revealed that the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the Alaska Airlines blowout that happened midair in early January. The DOJ has contacted passengers, crew, and pilots who were on the flight, which had to make an emergency landing in Portland. And now we have gained more insights into the sequence of events that led to the blowout. Boeing workers had spotted faulty parts on the plane's fuselage immediately after it arrived into a Boeing factory, but failed to repair them straight away. And when they did repair those faults 19 days later, workers removed but never replaced four critical bolts. Such work done outside of the normal production sequence is called Traveled work, and has been a top priority of Boeing's to eliminate because doing work out of order complicates the already complex process of putting together an airplane. We are exclusively reporting that natural gas production company, EQT, has struck a roughly $5.5 billion deal to buy back its former unit Equitrans Midstream in a bid to create a major natural gas provider. The all stock transaction is expected to be announced later today with the combined company set to be valued at more than $35 billion, including debt. The deal comes amid a spate of mergers and acquisitions within the commodity space. As oil and gas companies tried to capitalize on recent years profit gains following higher energy prices. And in apparent effort by the British royal family to address concerns about the health of Princess of Wales Kate Middleton appears to have backfired in dramatic fashion. Several global news agencies have pulled a photo released by the Royal Family showing the Princess alongside her three children with the Associated Press saying that the source appears to have manipulated the image. Reuters, Getty, and AFP have also removed the image from their systems. The image was posted by the Royal Family on social media on Sunday to commemorate Mother's Day in the UK, and marks the first official photo of the Princess since she underwent abdominal surgery in January. Kensington Palace didn't respond to a request for comment. And from unintentional drama to the scripted sort, Oppenheimer cleaned up at last Night's Academy Awards in what Journal Entertainment reporter John Jurgensen told us was a historic sweep. Oppenheimer landed seven awards including Best Picture, Best Actor for Cillian Murphy, and Best Director for Christopher Nolan, his first Oscars. It was the first time in years that a movie that was so dominant at the box office also dominated at the Oscars, which people often criticize for being disconnected from the tastes of regular moviegoers. You have to go back about 20 years to a Lord of the Rings movie to find a best picture winner that grossed anything close to what Oppenheimer did at the box office, which is approaching about $1 billion worldwide. Other highlights of the night included Emma Stone winning Best Actress for her performance in Poor Things, John Cena shuffling on stage to award best Costume design naked, and Ryan Gosling's performance of his Barbie anthem I'm just Ken. He's wearing a hot pink suit and gloves and glasses, and he had a surprisingly good voice as he belted it out live in the theater with dozens of Ken dancers behind him, and pretty much leading the whole Dolby theater and a sing-along, including many of his co-stars that he got on the mic. Televised award shows are fighting for relevance and for viewers, so a high energy night like this that also featured lots of popular movies and their stars in the mix has to be seen as a win for the Academy Awards. I'd be surprised if viewership didn't go up at least a bit from last year. And that's What's News for Monday morning. Today's show was produced by Kate Bullivant and Hattie Moir. Our supervising producer is Sandra Kilhof. We will be back tonight with a new show. And until then, thanks for listening. President Biden presents his budget proposal with the election in mind. And gold prices are soaring, but how sustainable is the rally? It really just depends on what you think the Fed is going to do. And that part of market psychology is still very important for what happens to gold, in particular in the U.S. Plus, Elon Musk is open-sourcing Grok, his chatbot rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT. It's Monday, March 11th. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. President biden has released his budget proposal, and it isn't expected to gain momentum in Congress. The plan would boost federal spending to $7.3 trillion next fiscal year. Some of the asks are familiar policy goals, raising taxes on the wealthy and large corporations, and lowering costs of prescription drugs, childcare, and housing. It's a largely symbolic document and the first step to kick off debate in Congress over plans for the next fiscal year. But the proposal's also a cornerstone of President Biden's reelection campaign. Welcome back, Andy. Thanks for having me. Okay. So Andy, we know this is a budget proposal, but we know too that it's an election year budget proposal. How important is it for Biden to lay out his priorities in this way? The budget proposal comes on the heels of the State of the Union last week, and so this is really in some ways an opportunity for the president and the White House to kick off the reelection fight and present their platform to the American people on a bigger stage than they often do. And so, many of the ideas in this budget are not new. They're things that the president ran for in 2020 and also that he's proposed to Congress several times previously. But given that it's an election year, there is a little bit more curiosity about even if this isn't something that's going to become law now, what does Joe Biden want to do and what are the policies that he supports? So in that sense it is a more interesting budget than it otherwise could be, but given that Congress is not likely to take up many of its elements. And let's remind our listeners, Congress still hasn't agreed on funding plans to cover this fiscal year. What are some of the toughest battle lines in this latest proposal, Andy? A clear place where there could be difficulty and has been difficulty in the past is on some of the tax increases that the president is laying out. He's been calling for many of these proposals for years now. And even when Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate in 2021 and 2022, the Democratic Party, President Biden's own party, rejected many of these tax plans. So given that even among Democrats there's division about the extent of some of these tax increases and Republicans almost uniformly post tax increases of any kind, those are likely to be particularly difficult parts of this budget to see becoming law. There's a similar story for some of the spending plans too in terms of proposals on paid leave, and child care, and things of that nature. So past performance does not predict future performance, but it doesn't bode well I guess for some of these ideas and their odds in Congress. Okay, the budget proposal is out. What kind of responses is it getting so far? So far the responses have been, at least the ones that I've seen, have been somewhat predictable in terms of Republicans harshly criticizing this and ally Democrats supporting it. Republicans are putting forward their own budget plan that would cut a lot of spending that President Biden wants to increase, and also they oppose tax increases. So it's broken down along party lines pretty quickly in a somewhat predictable way. This is a somewhat familiar process to many Americans, but remind us what happens next over the next couple months. The way this would usually go, and I guess there is no such thing as a normal budget year anymore, but the typical federal appropriations process, it's usually kicked off by the release of the budget. And then over the coming weeks, members of the administration will go to Capitol Hill and they will testify about the budget for their particular agencies or parts of the government. That's supposed to inform the budget that Congress ultimately puts together and passes over the course of the summer and into the fall. But as is often the case, and as is particularly the case this year, Congress is still late on last year's budget. And there have been a series of stopgap measures, basically extensions of previous funding such that Congress is just now getting around to potentially finally finishing this year's budget and we're more than halfway through the fiscal year. Given some of the dysfunction and disagreement over spending in particular in Congress, you could see the debate drag out through the end of the year and potentially into the next administration. U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Marcia Fudge, will be stepping down later this month. She'll be the third member of President Biden's cabinet to depart since 2021. The White House said HUD's Deputy Secretary, Adrianne Todman, will serve as Acting Secretary. It's unclear whether the Senate would confirm a successor during an election year. The U.S. is grappling with the country's highest recorded level of homelessness following the Covid-19 emergency. Coming up, riskier assets like stocks are reaching new highs in the U.S. amid investor optimism. So why is the price of gold, a haven asset, also hitting records? That's after the break. Elon Musk has already set up his own artificial intelligence company, xAI, to challenge rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Today, Musk announced his company will open-source its chatbot Grok. That means he's giving users free license to use and sometimes modify his creation. The move's the latest step in a feud between Musk and OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman. Musk sued OpenAI, Altman, and fellow founder Greg Brockman last month alleging the company abandoned its founding mission and that it's giving priority to profits over the benefits to humanity. Social media reporter, Alexa Corse, has more. This is Musk saying, \\\"I'm going to do this differently, not like OpenAI.\\\" And there may also be some other advantages. Open-sourcing can attract more developers and potential customers who want to test out the model. When you have developers outside your company who can really look closely at your model you can benefit from having feedback, more eyes on the model. Musk isn't the first person to do this. Meta actually made its model, called Llama 2, open-source. Then lastly, Musk has been supportive of the idea of open-source for a long time and we've seen some examples with aspects at Tesla and X as well. Gold has long been considered a haven asset, and investors have flocked to the precious metal as a safer bet during times of market volatility and geopolitical risk. So Bob, my father has invested in gold for several years. It's something he said he's putting aside for his kids, and I know many investors have used it in this way as a hedge against uncertainty in the future. But are there other factors at play right now that are driving the current rise in prices? Yeah, there definitely are. Gold is traditionally used by investors as a safe haven, a place they turn to when the economy looks like it might have difficulty, or conversely, if the economy is booming so much that inflation is a concern. Now there are several other factors at play. One is that the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates at some point, and cutting interest rates is good for gold. The other factors are outside the U.S. Central banks have become big purchasers of gold, especially in the last few years since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The third thing is, other overseas buyers in other economies that are in a different phase from the U.S. economy. The U.K., for example, entered recession towards the end of last year and there was a spike in gold purchases. In China, their property market has been battered, their stock market is down, and so people have turned to gold there. In India where the economy is booming, people are concerned about inflation and are buying gold for that reason as well. Why are central banks overseas buying more gold? The World Gold Council polls them and they've been asked about that. The most common reason for increasing their gold holdings is because of gold's historical performance in crisis. Whenever there's been a crisis they've stepped up their buying. So again, the 2008 financial crisis was what prompted them to really turn around and start buying rather than selling. And then more recently, Russia's invasion of Ukraine again highlighted geopolitical risk. It really comes down to that. Given all of these various factors, what are investors thinking about the sustainability of this current rally? There's very much mixed outlooks on that. And because the central banks are such a big factor, it really depends often what they're going to do and whether they're going to be dissuaded from buying gold at these higher prices. For example, China is well known in their commodity buying for being very judicious as to when they buy, whether it's oil, whether it's copper, whether it's gold. And with prices as high as they are some people think that central banks may slow down, and that could be a factor that puts a stop to the rally. On the other hand, others argue that the central bank holdings are quite small in emerging markets relative to developed markets. So there's still a lot of buying to be done and reasons to think they're going to continue. Of course, they're not the only factor. The other maybe big factor that could swing are U.S. investors which have been selling gold for actually quite a while because of the high interest rate environment. A lot of analysts expect that to flip as soon as it becomes clear that the Fed is definitely cutting rates in the near term. And then you may see that exchange-traded funds, which people have been selling gold whether by retail or institutional investors, they may stop selling and start buying. And if that happens, then the rally will not only continue but likely accelerate. Reddit says it's seeking to raise up to $748 million in its IPO aiming for a valuation of up to 6.4 billion. That's down from the $10 billion valuation the social media company had notched in its most recent fundraising round in 2021. And it's partly a reflection of investors waning appetite for unprofitable companies. In 2023, Reddit reported a net loss of more than $90 million, though the company posted net income of roughly 18 and a half million in the last three months of that year. The details come less than three weeks after Reddit said it had applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. And roughly 50 passengers aboard a Boeing 787 Dreamliner operated by Latam airlines received treatment by first responders after landing in Auckland, New Zealand. The airline said the aircraft traveling from Sydney, Australia to Auckland experienced a, quote, \\\"technical event during the flight, which caused a strong movement,\\\" end quote. New Zealand ambulance service transported a dozen patients to the hospital, including one with serious injuries. Boeing's reputation has suffered from a pair of fatal 737 MAX 8 crashes in 2018 and 2019 that grounded hundreds of jets for nearly two years. More recently, Boeing has been dogged by issues with various models including misdrilled holes, loose rudder bolts, and a door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines MAX 9 flight in January. And finally, there are a few recognizable features inside a car, a steering wheel, seats facing the same direction, and a windshield with hopefully a clear view of the road. But as self-driving cars get closer to reality car designers and tech companies are thinking outside the box when it comes to the space inside a vehicle. Could they, for example, get rid of that steering wheel, or use the windshield to show videos or PowerPoint slides? Our European automotive reporter, William Boston, says it's a real shift for designers. One of the things they want to do is be sociable. And they don't want to kneel on the front seat and look over the bench seat in the back and talk to people who are driving in the car. They want to turn the seat around. They want to have a room that's a lounge, or a room that's an office, or a room that can be converted into a bedroom where they can lay down and sleep while the car drives them from Germany to Italy, or from New York to Los Angeles. So the vehicle now is an open space that can be used for various functions, and that's kind of where things are going. We may get there, we may not get that far, but it's taking steps now in this direction. I like the creativity but I'm not so sure about having a video screen replace my windshield even if I'm not the one driving. And that's What's News for this Monday afternoon.

Thanks for listening.\",\"Rising immigration reverses population declines in American cities. Plus, fresh warning signs for the EV market as startup, Fisker, looks into a possible bankruptcy. And while the world was focused elsewhere, North Korea leveled up. Jung Un has dramatically advanced its regional weaponry. They've made them nuclear capable, and that's a menace for Seoul, Tokyo, and all the American soldiers in the region. It's Thursday, March 14th. Accelerating immigration has boosted the population in the 50 largest metro areas in the U.S. amid a 15% increase in net arrivals from abroad last year. That is according to new census figures and Journal estimates that immigration reporter Michelle Hackman says paint a complex picture about the state of American cities after COVID. So, the latest census data shows us that a lot of the trends we saw during the pandemic are starting to reverse. A lot of what we saw were people newly mobile because they were remote working, moving from big cities to smaller cities, and now we're seeing big cities experiencing a resurgence, and it's actually not necessarily because of Americans moving around or more births, but because of a spike in immigration. Immigration is back to pre-pandemic levels, and as we know, immigrants have been by and large heading to these larger cities, like New York, like Chicago. There are a few places where actually immigration was the only reason why cities grew. For example, Philadelphia, Boston, Miami, even places like Salt Lake City. Had it not been for immigration, those cities would have shrank. Other cities are continuing to shrink, with New York City, for instance, still down half a million people compared to the start of the pandemic. Though population losses there and in L.A. and Chicago are narrowing. That is thanks to a recent influx of migrants driven there in part because of guarantees of free shelter. However, Michelle said it's not possible to tell from the data how much population growth is directly related to the situation at the border. The census estimates that about 1.6 million net new immigrants came to the country last year, but that I will note, is smaller than some other estimates. There are some places, including the Congressional Budget Office, that say it could be as many as 3.3 million immigrants. Some people even say it could be more than that. We know how many migrants were arrested at the border, but it's much harder to know how many were deported versus how many were released into the country versus how many were detained and later deported or detained and later released. And that's why you have all these different estimates. Adding to the uncertainty, some 3.4 million cases remain backlogged in immigration courts, a backup that could take years to resolve before immigrants learn whether they'll be allowed to stay in the U.S. or face deportation. While the world was looking elsewhere, North Korea has become a bigger threat. That is the conclusion of our Korea bureau chief, Timothy Martin, who has been taking stock of the dramatic steps that Kim Jong Un has taken in recent years to increase his military's capabilities and its diplomatic connections. And as the U.S. and South Korea wrap up joint military exercises today, Tim reports that their sense of alarm at the North's advances is palpable. Tim, recap for us the gains that North Korea has made in the last few years. This was a country that was front and center for a while and then just a whole lot of other foreign policy priorities kind of buried it. A lot has happened in the five years since Kim Jong Un met former president Donald Trump in Singapore. Jung Un has dramatically advanced its regional weaponry. They've made them nuclear capable, and that's a menace for Seoul, Tokyo, and all the American soldiers in the region. They've also unrolled new technology for the long range missiles that can strike the U.S. They've made first runs at things like spy satellites, advanced submarine launched missiles, even explored hypersonic technology. So, we've seen a whole laundry list of North Korean weapon advances from Kim Jong Un in recent years, and without much fanfare. Did that catch foreign observers off guard, the fact that all of this could get done kind of at the same time? The U.S. has tried more than a dozen times to add more sanctions or to condemn North Korea for its illegal weapons behavior, each has failed. And I think that recognition only illustrates we're in this Cold War era again. And what's transpired in recent years, we've seen Kim Jong Un draw closer to Vladimir Putin. North Korea and Russia are expanding their relationship. There are assertions that Kim Jong Un and North Korea are supplying Russia's war efforts with munitions and even short range missiles. And there are broad expectations that Russia is helping North Korea not only with food aid, but also perhaps giving them tips on how to make their weapons even more menacing, even more dangerous to the world. Kim was very strategic in embracing Russia. North Korea was one of the few countries to publicly back Russia's invasion of Ukraine a few years ago. And Russia has a vote at the Un Security Council. So, the world has been unable to stop Kim Jong Un from advancing his nuclear and weapons technologies, so he's been able to act with impunity. Tim, you've just wrapped up a number of big interviews with senior military figures on the Korean peninsula. What do they see as North Korea's actual threat as opposed to maybe just the risk that it poses on paper all of these technological advances? I sat down with four star Generals from South Korea and the U.S., including America's top military official here in South Korea, General Paul LaCamera. And he told me that his thinking had evolved on how to deter Kim Jong Un. In the past, the aim was to try and dissuade Kim from developing his nuclear technologies. Now, we're past that point. Now, the aim is to try and get Kim not to use those weapons, and that's a significant shift. And what are they doing about it? Well, springtime exercises that have been dramatically expanded, even the number of participating troops have doubled. So, the approach both by America, South Korea, and allies is to really show Kim Jong Un that if he were to try and take this to a military conflict, to a battlefield situation, the U.S., South Korea, and others would be standing there ready. You mentioned this top U.S. official saying that the thinking had evolved, that it's no longer about stopping development of weapons tech, it's about making sure North Korea doesn't use those weapons. Are there tough choices then that the U.S. and South Korea may need to make in the coming years when it comes to trying to contain Pyongyang? North Korea stands as one of the hot button issues in the world, and because its nuclear advances are proceeding unchecked, what the U.S. and South Korea are trying to figure out is, \\\"What is our risk appetite for any type of clash with North Korea?\\\" The current South Korean administration, they're conservative, they back a tougher line against Pyongyang. They've been very bellicose in their language, that any type of North Korea provocation would be met with an overwhelming response. Seoul officials have said, \\\"Kim Jong Un has two options, peace or destruction.\\\" And the U.S. might have a slightly different viewpoint. Of course, this is not their homeland, but they have soldiers here. And I think that's what the two countries need to reconcile, which is of all the actions that North Korea could take, what is the appropriate level of response. In recent years, South Korea, the U.S. and even Japan have bonded more closely together on the military, and that is something Kim Jong Un would not welcome. So, that's where a lot of the effort will be aimed in the years ahead. And Tim, I've got to just ask quickly. It's an election year and the U.S. is already trying to put out fires in the Middle East and keep the focus on Ukraine. Is there a scenario in which North Korea could become a front page issue again? This is what Kim Jong-Un wants the world to think, and this is what many military strategists are worried about. The world is preoccupied already with wars in the Middle East and Europe. Could a third front open up in Asia, be that Taiwan or between the two Koreas? This type of global chaos is an environment that Kim Jong Un really welcomes, because ultimately, he doesn't want a war. Any type of nuclear strike against the U.S. would mean the end of his regime, the end of him. What he wants is to set up a scenario where he's able to humiliate South Korea, that he's able to raise the perception of threat and danger so high that the U.S. feels like it has no other option but to come back to the table and negotiate a de-nuclearization deal that would be favorable to Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un's ultimate ask might remain the same. He wants sanctions removed. He wants recognition from the U.S. as a proper country. He would like for his country to be recognized as a nuclear state, which he has defacto status as of now. But I think what's changed is his ability to stay away from the negotiating table. Tim, thanks so much for bringing us this story. Thanks. Coming up, the EV slump takes its toll as startup, Fisker, considers filing for bankruptcy, and how Hamas may have used crypto to fund its operations. Those stories and more after the break. Now, to a Journal exclusive, as we've learned that EV startup, Fisker, is preparing for a possible bankruptcy filing. The company went public last year, but is saddled with more than a billion dollars in debt and has struggled with sales growth as EV demand slumped. Journal reporter, Sean McClain, who covers EV startups, says Fisker is working with restructuring advisors, financial advisors, and law firms. Sean McClain: Fisker has a number of plans that they're working on to potentially turn their situation around. One is seeking additional money from existing investors and talking to a large car maker, as they put it, for potential investment and also a joint manufacturing agreement in the U.S. And the reason why that's important is currently Fisker makes all its EVs overseas at a factory in Austria, and that means none of their vehicles qualify for a federal EV purchase tax credit. Being able to build in the U.S. will make their vehicles more affordable and also allow them to launch two new vehicles, including a pickup truck, another is a $30,000 small crossover. That said, Fisker's finances are in rough shape. They issued a going concern warning. The going concern warning means they may not have enough money to fund their business for this year. And so, they're out looking for additional investment. Fisker declined to comment. And in more EV news, Hyundai and its sibling company, Kia, are recalling around 170,000 of their electric vehicles in South Korea over faulty software that could cause the loss of power while driving. The recall affects some of Hyundai's Ionic and Genesis models. Hyundai Motor Group says it doesn't yet have an official estimate on the recalls' global impact, though some local media outlets have reported that around 600,000 EVs could be affected. We are exclusively reporting that the U.S. Treasury Department is investigating $165 million in cryptocurrency-linked transactions that may have helped finance Hamas before the militant group's October 7th attack on Israel. The findings upend the traditional view that crypto is used by terrorist groups only as a meager form of crowdfunding and come as Hamas' access to traditional sources of funding have been hit by Western sanctions. Alex Frangos is a Journal finance editor and says the revelations could lead to further crypto regulation. Treasury is asking Congress basically for more powers to be able to regulate and see what's going on in this super murky world. There are those in the crypto industry who think this is overblown and that the amount of money that Hamas maybe has used through crypto is lower. So, there's definitely two sides to this, but the Treasury is pretty insistent that they need better powers to be able to see what's going on. In the old days, people laundered money through the banks, and it was easier for the Treasury Department to just call up a bank and be like, \\\"Hey, you need to tell us what's going on.\\\" With crypto, it's much harder to do that because a lot of the exchanges are totally private, unregulated, offshore. They don't know your customer procedures, so what they want is better powers to be able to peer into that pipeline of money moving around and peer around and see what's going on. And a record amount of people are taking early withdrawals from their 401k accounts as more Americans turn to their pension pots for emergency funding as the price of everything from daycare to food keeps on going up. Journal retirement reporter, Anne Tergesen, has more. Such withdrawals, which are referred to as hardship withdrawals in the industry, those reached a record 3.6% of participants at Vanguard 401k plans in 2023. 3.6% is a pretty small percentage. However, that is a record level, and it's up from 2.8% in 2022. I think the 401k data also reflects a divergence. I think a lot of people are doing very well. Those who can afford to save are really saving. However, there also are a lot of people who maybe aren't doing as well and who feel the need to rely on their 401k savings in an emergency. If you take a hardship withdrawal, you're taking that money out, you're paying income tax on the money you withdraw. If you're younger than 59 and a half, you're also probably paying a 10% penalty on your withdrawal. People really shouldn't take them unless they absolutely need the money. And if you've got questions about what the continued rise in prices means for your family budget, we'd love to hear them.

Our supervising producer is Sandra Kilhof. We will be back tonight with a new show. And until then, thanks for listening Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer calls for an end to Benjamin Netanyahu's government in Israel. And, we'll look into the connection between big profits and high prices. In some sense, companies are essentially exploiting this cognitive flaw humans have that they just are not punishing them for their failure to pass on cost savings. Plus, former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin wants to buy TikTok. It's Thursday, March 14th. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. Schumer is the highest ranking Jewish elected official in the US government. He delivered a speech on the Senate floor earlier today. I believe a new election is the only way to allow for a healthy and open decision making process about the future of Israel, at a time when so many Israelis have lost their confidence in the vision and direction of their government. Schumer's speech is the latest in a series of high level warnings and White House actions aimed at pressuring Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and rethink its war plans for Hamas, whose deadly attack on Israel sparked the war in October. The address marked an unusually direct criticism of the democratically elected leader of a close ally and sparked sharp pushback from Congressional Republicans and from Israel's ambassador to the US. Private equity. Those big names like Apollo, Blackstone, and KKR already dominate corporate finance, but now they're turning their eyes to US consumers. The firms are pushing into what's known as asset-based finance, think auto loans, credit cards, and real estate mortgages. It's a market worth potentially hundreds of billions of dollars. Welcome, Matt. Hello. So why are private equity firms interested in going this route? Is it just the profit potential? Yeah. It's scale. That's really what this offers them. It's the opportunity to grow much bigger, much faster. And it's interesting the question you said private equity firms. These firms really aren't private equity firms predominantly anymore. The bulk of their assets under management are actually no longer private equity. That's still a big chunk, but they've sort of maxed out that market. So they moved from that to making loans to corporations and now they've kind of maxed out that market. And so, they need a new frontier, and they found it in this much bigger, much more varied pool of loans that historically, have been made by banks. The big picture is just that they are becoming massive. They're becoming much, much bigger and much more important to the financial system in our country and around the world. What does this mean for their profits? It's good for their shareholders and it's really good for the executives. Many of them are founders of these firms and they still own significant amounts of the shares. And so, when the assets under management of these companies grows by say 20% or 30%, the stock valuation goes up a multiple of that and they make a lot of money. And what does it mean for consumers? I think we don't know. We really don't. Because regulation of these institutions is not prepared for them doing this type of lending, and so we don't really know how it's going to play out in the short term. What it means is that consumers should do maybe a little bit more homework than they used to. They should ask of their credit card company. Okay, so you're the name on my credit card bill, but do you own my loan? Do you own my credit card balance? Or to somebody else? That would be a good place to start. Coming up, big profits and high prices are often linked. We'll dive into the details of the connection between the two after the break. US retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in February, slightly less than expected. The monthly report on how consumers are spending or pulling back is viewed as a harbinger for the state of the US economy. The results show consumer spending is still robust, but not as strong as economists. We're hoping many believe Americans are now close to spending down their savings and feeling stretched by inflation, which has impacted the prices of everyday essentials like groceries. We'd actually like to hear from you about that. What questions do you have about food price inflation and what it means for your family budget? Send us a note or even better record a voice memo on your phone and send it to Wnpod@wsj.com. That's W-N-P-O-D at wsj.com. You can also leave us a voicemail at 212-416-4328. Just be sure to include your name and location. We might use it on the show. And when we talk about high prices, we often draw connections with big profits. President Biden even referenced them during his State of the Union address last week where he used the term shrinkflation and price gouging. So is it all politics or is there any truth to it? Our chief economics commentator Greg Ip, tackles this in his latest capital account column and he joins me now to explain. Welcome back, Greg. Thanks for having me. So let's start with the ways big profits and higher prices are connected. We did see some of this during the height of the pandemic. When companies saw more profits, they raise prices. Exactly. And when you actually look at what was going on, it's really not that surprising. You had basically this gigantic wall of demand as people emerged from lockdowns and wanted to spend. They had all these stimulus checks. We had low interest rates and company's ability to produce enough to meet that demand was very constrained because there were supply chain bottlenecks everywhere. If you essentially have unlimited demand and very limited supply, that's a recipe to raise prices. That goes straight to margins. No big mystery there. The question mark arises when, in the last year, almost all the evidence tells us that supply chain problems are pretty much fixed. And yet profit margins are still very high. They're not coming down. And, just as a matter of arithmetic, because profit margins haven't come down more, that means prices also haven't come down as much. And so this at least tells us there is something there when people complain that high profits might be part of the story about why inflation hasn't come down more. So given that, what are some of the caveats we're not considering? Well, if you listen to President Biden, he says, \\\"Oh, it's all about junk fees.\\\" You buy this concert ticket and you end up paying $10 more than you thought, or he'll say, \\\"It's shrinkflation. That Snickers bar is smaller than it used to be.\\\" But if you actually study these phenomena, yes, they exist, but it's very hard to show that they're getting worse. So that's not really a story. What about the notion that market power is becoming more concentrated in the hands of a few companies? The problem with that was we don't really have much evidence that the market is more concentrated now than it was three or four years ago. The final possibility though is sort of like psychology, which is that in the oil market, they used to talk about rockets and feathers. When oil prices went up, gasoline followed like a rocket. When oil prices went down, gasoline kind of only slowly flowed down like a feather. Well, it turns out that rockets and feathers pretty much represents the way prices behave across the whole economy. It looks like what happened is that costs shot up in the early part of the pandemic. Companies were very quick to pass that through to prices. Costs have since come down a bit or they've stopped going up. Companies have not passed that benefit onto their customers. Company marketing departments have figured out that people will swallow a price increase and they won't necessarily insist on that price going down again later on. So maybe that's part of the story is that in some sense, companies are essentially exploiting this cognitive flaw humans have, that they just are not punishing them for their failure to pass on cost savings. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is interested in buying TikTok. He said he's putting together a group to try to purchase the short video app after the house voted yesterday to ban it in the US or force a sale. Mnuchin has long crusaded against Chinese ownership of the app. He hasn't said how much he might pay for TikTok, which could be valued at more than a hundred billion dollars. A deal is far from guaranteed. Senate lawmakers have signaled a more cautious approach to a ban or forced sale, which would have little precedent. TikTok and its owner ByteDance didn't respond to request for comment today. SpaceX pulled off an extended flight through space during its third test mission today. The spacecraft known as Starship successfully separated from its booster and proceeded to fly for around an hour before it was lost while reentering earth's atmosphere. The mission advanced much farther than the company's previous two Starship test flights, marking major progress for a vehicle that could one day transport astronauts to the moon and beyond. And finally, gene editing is complicated and typically involves extracting a patient's cells, tweaking the DNA they contain, and reintroducing them into the body. Now, there's a new frontier. Dozens of people have participated in studies of in vivo editing, which involves editing cells inside the body. One patient in his seventies suffers from a genetic mutation that caused clumps of malformed proteins to build up in his heart, hindering its ability to pump blood. So he underwent a treatment that turned off the gene producing those proteins and his symptoms improved. But this medical innovation isn't without controversy. Betsy McKay: The benefits of a medicine like this compared with say, regular drugs are that first of all, it's a one-time treatment. One and done as they call it. And the in vivo treatment is something that could be done more easily in developing countries. Ultimately, it could reach more people and it could be cheaper. It's also, probably, the approach that's going to be needed for most diseases. The benefit for reaching a lot of people is you're doing this inside the body, but that's also the risk. If you're editing cells in a lab and something goes wrong, you have some unintended consequence, you can see it. This is being done in your body. And the concern is that you might accidentally do what's called off target gene editing. You hit some other gene and you might not know it right away. As one professor of cell biology and physiology told Betsy, when it comes to gene editing, we don't know what we don't know. And that's what's news for this Thursday afternoon.

The Foundation of Innovation. Republican Nikki Haley is pulling out of the presidential race, leaving the way clear for Donald Trump to go head-to-head with Joe Biden this November. She had just one win in Vermont on Super Tuesday, but Biden and Trump dominated the votes overall, with Biden picking up delegate votes in every state in play. In Minnesota, 19% of Democrats marked their ballots as uncommitted to show their displeasure with Biden's position on Israel and Gaza. So what else have we learned from the primary vote that we didn't already know? Political reporter, Gerrit Renshaw was up late watching the returns so you didn't have to. Hey, Gerrit. Hello. How you doing? Good, good. So the headline out of Michigan last week was this sizable number of voters marking their ballots uncommitted. What did we see on Tuesday? You know, Michigan had the advantage of a real week's long, once long effort, really in Minnesota and some other states we saw, but it was a little bit more dispersed, less organized and quite frankly just less time. They will argue that they have been successful because Biden and the White House have kind of really shifted their tone a little bit on the issue and been a little bit more forceful with Gaza. So they are claiming victories outside of the election process. So what do we know from the results from exit polling that might give us some insight into November? One interesting thing that the Biden campaign is really looking at hard and probably the Trump campaign quite frankly is that Nikki Haley voters have told pollsters after they voted that they will not support the Republican nominee no matter who it is. Some 81% in North Carolina and some 68% in California told pollsters the same. So that's got to be a big number and expect the media to focus on who they are and how serious are they about not voting Republican come November. One thing that's interesting is that polls continually show that people look back and look at the four years of Trump and feel better about it than they did at the time. And that's something that I think will see the Biden campaign really try to drive down. You can see more of the key takeaways from super Tuesday on Reuters dot com as well as on our app. One of the bigger political developments has nothing to do with super Tuesday. Arizona Senator Kristen cinema says she's not running for reelection her decision shakes up the race in a highly competitive state which is critical to Democrats if they want to keep the majority. Haley's prime minister has landed in Puerto Rico ending uncertainty about his whereabouts since a trip to Kenya. But a question remains on how and when he will return to Haiti as gangs there call for him to step down. Bitcoin has hit an all time high likely fueled by investors pouring into new US crypto ETFs. At the same time the world's biggest stable coin tether has smashed its own record with more than $100 billion in circulation. That digital dollar is designed to keep a constant value so its size may be peaking regulators concerns. Fintech reporter Elizabeth Howcroft is in London watching both rallies. The last time Bitcoin hit an all time high was in November 2021 when it reached around $69,000 but then it fell pretty sharply in 2022 as various crypto firms collapsed and investors lost confidence. So to some people in the crypto world the fact that Bitcoin is back around these all time highs is a sign that the industry has recovered from all the problems of the last couple of years. Now what about tether so tether having hit $100 billion worth of tokens in circulation makes it the third big deal. So why are regulators concerned? Well various regulators have raised concerns that big stable coins could be a point at which problems in crypto markets spread into wider financial markets. For example, if people rush to exchange their stable coins back into dollars that could affect the banks who hold those dollar based reserves. Now various countries are developing rules around stable coins at the moment but tether is not currently subject to specific regulations about its stable coin activities. Work at Tesla's European Gigafactory near Berlin has been halted until further notice after a suspected arson attack. So our left activists, the volcano group have claimed responsibility to the local press leading Tesla CEO Elon Musk to label them the quote dumbest eco terrorists on earth. Kristoff states is in Germany. Kristoff, what can you tell us about the group behind this? What's interesting about them is that they have a history of interfering with infrastructure in Germany. There have been a few incidents where they claim responsibility. Police however are still trying to verify whether that letter is authentic but police are investigating. Does this letter make clear Tesla and therefore Elon Musk was the target of their anger? If you read the letter very carefully, a lot of criticism goes against Elon and the way he handles business. If it turns out to be verified it was a clear attack on Tesla and on Elon Musk, a clear desire to disrupt key infrastructure and raise attention. What's the cost likely to be? They basically said that the damage they expect will be a high nine digit sum. So that translates into like hundreds of millions of euros and losses. We're trying to verify how they arrive at that number but it gives you an idea about the level of disruption that has taken place. And what about the damage to the brand and Germany's brand? I think that is actually the most critical question at the moment. What does this say about security of infrastructure in Germany? At a time when companies like Intel or TSMC are considering or have actually decided in favor of major investments in the eastern part of Germany? Earlier this week our cameras caught 12-year-old Yazan al-Kafarina in a hospital bed in Rafa. He was on the brink of death. Emaciated his bones protruding, a skeleton of a boy in a yellow hoodie. His mother, Um Yazan al-Kafarina, telling us that before the war, Yazan was a healthy child. Two days after our cameras left, Yazan died, his mother by his side. Only a fraction of the aid needed is getting into Gaza and children are dying. UN experts say Gaza is close to famine. But what's in a word when so many people are already dying? Michelle Nichols is at the UN. Michelle, what constitutes a famine and who decides when it meets that threshold? So a famine is classified or declared by a group called the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, which is known in short as the IPC. And that's made up, it's a global scale of one to five. So what is the threshold for something being a famine? So for a famine to be declared, there's three thresholds that have to be met. At least 20% of the population has to be suffering extreme food shortages. One in three children are cutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or death. So at least 20% of the population in Gaza at the moment is suffering extreme food shortages. But the other two thresholds haven't been met yet to formally say that there is a famine either throughout Gaza or in certain parts of Gaza. What are the difficulties in assessing whether Gaza in particular, an actor war zone, is in famine? The difficulty comes with getting the data for the other two thresholds, which when the health care system has sort of broken down, and it's a little more difficult to establish whether one in three children are cutely malnourished or two people out of every 10,000 are dying from starvation or malnutrition. What difference would it make for Gaza to be declared in famine? There's UN officials have regularly pointed out over the years when other countries have been on the brink of famine. Once a famine is declared, it's generally too late for a lot of people in that situation. People are already dying. People are already starving. Alright, that's a wrap on Wednesday's edition.

But the latest economic predictions show US central bankers are becoming more hawkish. President Biden pushes a big investment by chipmaker Intel in Arizona, where independent voters are in play. And Somali pirates are back, exacerbating the crisis facing global shipping. This Thursday, March 21st, this is Reuters World News, bringing you everything you need to know from the front lines in 10 minutes every weekday. I'm Carmel Kremens in Dublin. And I'm Christopher Walgesberg in Chicago. This episode is brought to you by UI Path. Today, 90% of the Fortune 500 are accelerating human achievements simply, with UI Path. The world's number one AI-powered business automation platform, UI Path, the foundation of innovation. All three major stock indices hit new record highs following the news that the Federal Reserve is still planning three rate cuts this year. But that's becoming less of a sure thing. The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. Fed Chair Jerome Powell says that efforts to combat inflation are working, but it's proving stickier than anticipated. And nearly half the Fed's Board of Governors is leaning towards fewer rate cuts this year, with the Board projecting stronger GDP growth in 2024. Our reporter Howard Schneider was at the Fed. Howard, why were investors so positive on this news? Well, I think a couple of things happened here. One, the Fed thinks it can cut rates, see inflation edge slowly, slowly back to its target, and actually upgrade the outlook for GDP. They see the unemployment rate really doing nothing ending the year at 4%. So add that up. You've got a strong economy, continued slowing inflation and some rate cuts. It's kind of sweet, you know, all told. Powell's comments often reveal the way the Board is leaning. And with such a narrow split, nine governors leaning towards fewer cuts and 10 still on board with the three cuts this year, did Powell give any indication of the Fed's plans for the rest of the year? Yeah, I think the thing that might be concerning is that if there's a bias here, it's a bias towards higher rates for longer. The median, the point where half saw one side, half saw the other did stay at three cuts for the year. But the distribution shifted a little bit and man, that is teetering right at the brink of going down to two cuts. And then if you keep getting these sticky inflation reports and Powell spoke to January and February, both of which were stronger than expected. And he said, you know what, we're not changing the underlying story of continued disinflation. But this didn't give us any greater confidence that we're really around the bend. So is there a scenario in which the Fed doesn't cut rates at all in 2024? We've got some fairly prominent forecasters out there on the likes of Joe Davis, chief economist at Vanguard, Torsten Slok and Apollo, who said they don't think the Fed's going to be able to cut it all this year on the grounds of inflation just being persistent. The meeting underscores just how partisan support for Israel has become in DC. Republicans have accused Schumer of trying to overthrow the Israeli leader.

Their job, to protect vessels from pirates, following a resurgence of attacks. After lying dormant for a decade, Somali pirates are back. Raising the risk factor for shipping companies, already contending with drone and missile strikes from hootie rebels in the Red Sea. Jonathan Saul has been looking at the story. Jonathan, what kind of attacks are Somali pirates carrying out? The type of attacks we're seeing are very different to what occurred 10 to 12 years ago when Somali piracy was at its height. What we're seeing now are very much pinpointed attempts to try and target smaller ships in much more remote locations. The type of ships they're looking to target are much smaller craft, such as fishing vessels, fishing dows and smaller cargo ships as well. The difference with Somali gangs is that they take a very much of a business model. It's about snatching ships, holding cruise hostage and getting ransom money. That essentially is their model, as opposed to the hoothies, which are very much aimed at targeting, destroying, sinking or damaging ships. What's the impact of all of this? We've seen rates certainly ticking higher for the broader Red Sea area. Rates are now for additional warriors, pre-mins, hundreds of thousands of dollars for a seven-day voyage. The expectation is that those rates will stay relatively around the levels we're seeing now, but it certainly adds a lot of cost onto a voyage. It's not just the cost of insurance. It's also the cost of transiting through the Suez Canal. That's half a million dollars there alone. The total cost is looking at $3 million plus for a voyage, which is pretty steep for a single ship. The Somali authorities are trying to combat this as best as they can. They're very stretched. They don't have enough resources. The big problem really and the big question is what's going to happen with international naval forces? Because international naval forces are being pressed to deal with the threats from hoothies or defensive responses. That means that there potentially aren't enough forces, warships, physical manpower to be able to tackle a surge in Somali piracy. We will enable a large semiconductor manufacturing to make a comeback here in America after 40 years. President Biden in Arizona touting a new plan from Intel to spend $100 billion across four US states. The company is looking to build and expand factories in Ohio, New Mexico, Oregon, and Arizona after securing nearly $20 billion in government spending. Combined, it will create nearly 20,000 construction jobs, many of which will be union jobs. The funds come from the 2022 Chips and Science Act to boost the domestic semiconductor industry and reduce reliance on China and Taiwan. Stephen Ellis covers the tech industry. Stephen I couldn't help but notice Biden's announcing this plan in Arizona. A state he really needs to win in order to secure another four years in the White House. So there's no way to completely separate this money from politics. It's not an accident that President Biden is going to show up and talk about this in Arizona, which has become a swing state. When most of the other states that will receive funding under this bill are actually probably not going to be swing states. Oregon is solidly blue. Ohio has become solidly red. And I think what the President will want to show is that we are for the first time a decade in the United States doing active industrial policy. This is about building factories and creating jobs. So the retail politics of this are quite obvious. Build factories, build jobs run on the economic record for President Biden. How does this move fit into the larger fight for dominance in microchips? For decades, the United States is actually the leader in manufacturing, the smallest and fastest and most energy efficient chips. However, that lead has essentially been lost to Taiwan. And there are a lot of questions over how sustainable it is to have all the world's chips coming out of Taiwan. So the goal of the chips act here was to bring a lot of that manufacturing back to the United States. And it's been the flip side of the coin where the US has tried to boost its own chip manufacturing industry. It holds back China's industry with a bunch of export controls and other measures designed to slow China down. This episode is brought to you by progressive insurance.

Bitcoin is within striking distance of its all-time high. The largest cryptocurrency by market value briefly crossed $68,000 last night, just $990 from its previous record before dropping slightly this morning. He was market's reporter, Caitlin McCabe. Bitcoin is an incredibly volatile asset. So I'm personally always a bit wary of making strong predictions of where it will go. But that being said, we are seeing Bitcoin on this pretty incredible run this year. It's prices risen by more than 50 percent. And some people are feeling pretty optimistic about its trajectory, especially given the excitement around Bitcoin ETFs. But it's important to keep in mind that we've been here before. You know, people were feeling really optimistic the last time we saw Bitcoin trade consistently above $60,000 in November 2021, only for it to finish in the $40,000 range by the end of that year. Bitcoin's climb has been aided by the early success of exchange traded funds that hold the cryptocurrency. Just last week, the BlackRock I shares Bitcoin trust, a clipped $10 billion in assets, becoming the fastest ever new ETF to reach that milestone. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has reclaimed the title as the world's richest person, nudging Elon Musk into second place, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Shares in Tesla have dropped by 24 percent year to date, dragging Musk's net worth down by $31 billion so far this year. The news also comes as Musk is being sued by four former Twitter executives claiming that he owes them more than $128 million in severance. The year-long dispute originates from Musk's takeover of the social media platform where he fired the executives for negligence and willful misconduct, which they deny. Musk's lawyer has declined to comment on the suit. And regulators probing the mid-air blowout on Alaska Airlines plane in January have found that Boeing allegedly failed to comply with quality control requirements in manufacturing. That comes after the Federal Aviation Administration carried out a six-week audit of Boeing and manufacturing partner Spirit Aerosystems in response to the incident. In order to hold Boeing accountable, the FAA says it's halted production expansion of the company's 737 MAX planes and will continue its on-site presence at Boeing and Spirit's manufacturing facilities. China has set a 5 percent growth target for this year. A rate higher than many economists had expected and adding pressure on Beijing to deliver as economic challenges mount. It is one of the big announcements to come out of the annual gathering of top Chinese policymakers known as the two sessions meetings, which got underway in earnest today and which offer a number of clues but the direction the country's leaders which to take it. Jonathan Cheng is the journal's Beijing Bureau Chief and he joins me now with a look at China's latest growth forecast and the plans to jumpstart the world's second-largest economy. Jonathan 5 percent what should we make of this growth target? Well first of all it's exactly the same as the number that we had for last year which perhaps predictably they did succeed in making. They very rarely missed their growth targets. It definitely is an indicator both of what they think the economy is going to do as well as what they might do in terms of stimulus to attain that target. So it is very closely watched and it is interesting that they're able to keep it at that same level because most outside forecasters, if you look at the IMF or the World Bank or others, they'll tell you that growth is probably right now on a trajectory to hit something like four and a half or four point six percent this year. But again that's knowing what we know right now and that would be in the absence of stimulus. So to say five percent suggests that there may be some more juicing of the economy from the Chinese government this year. What plans are we hearing about taking shape in order to hit this target given that they barely hit it last year? You said perhaps predictably they did hit it but it was touch-and-go watching from abroad. It was touch-and-go but the worst stimulus measures last year, nothing like what we saw during the financial crisis but they did need to rely on that to get to their target. This year what we heard from the Premier Lietien was he told us one that we're going to hit five percent growth and two that we're going to get there in part by issuing one trillion Chinese yuan of ultra long special bonds issued by the central government. One trillion yuan is about 140 billion dollars so it is a substantial sum and what's notable about it is that they've only done this three previous times in the past quarter century that is issuing one of these ultra long special bonds from the central government and the previous three times were during the Asian financial crisis in 1998 during the global financial crisis in 2007-2008 and then during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. So that does say something about the mindset of Beijing's leadership. Given this expectation of another year of five percent growth setting up at least a two-year plateauing of what was once a very steep growth curve, what does this all mean for the rest of the world economically speaking for the year ahead and beyond really? Well obviously China's world's second largest economy so it is one that is very plugged into many other countries and their economic futures. Are there actually more countries in the world that count China as their top trading partner than the US? So that gives you a sense of how this could ripple around the world. Of course China's economy has been in a bit of a funk for the last couple of years. Now there was COVID so the whole world was in a funk you could say but we're now starting to get a pretty clear picture that China is not going to be able to be that engine of growth in the same way that it was for the decade or two prior to COVID. It was always inevitable that it would plateau. It's just the speed with which it's happening is the surprising part that is what is going to be difficult for the rest of the world to be able to digest whether you're selling natural resources to China like Australia, Canada and many other countries or whether you're trying to sell goods into China to Chinese consumers. If China does turn as many economists expect it to towards exporting more of its goods that it can't sell at home then you may start to see a lot of Chinese goods, electric vehicle solar panels and other things flooding the world market and that is potentially going to have a disinflationary effect on the world and maybe that sounds like a relief after a couple of years of worrying about inflation being too high but it will of course threaten a lot of electric vehicle industries in other countries to give one example you may see trade protectionism start to grow again and that may lead to a very different picture than we have today. Coming up the UN finds grounds to believe that sexual violence including rape occurred during Hamas's October 7th attacks on Israel plus the Supreme Court temporarily blocks a Texas law allowing police to arrest migrants, those stories and more after the break. Music A UN report has concluded that there are reasons to believe sexual violence including rape occurred during Hamas's October 7th attacks on Israel in which 1200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage. The report from the UN's special representative on sexual violence in conflict also found clear and credible evidence that female hostages were raped but did not have enough information to attribute the sexual violence in rape to Hamas or any other armed groups. Hamas officials have denied that its fighters raped women but the group didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the UN findings. Meanwhile after conducting humanitarian air drops into Gaza over the weekend, Journal Middle East correspondent Jared Moussen told me that the US is exploring more ways to address the humanitarian situation in the territory. After Vice President Kamala Harris called conditions there inhumane. US officials are saying they're exploring a range of options to get aid in. They're also looking into a maritime corridor potentially to bring aid from somewhere like Cyprus across the Mediterranean and this is an expression of the Biden administration's increasing frustration with the Israeli government where they are trying to without using coercive means like cutting off the supply of weapons for the war in Gaza. They're using other means to show that they're not happy with the situation by essentially going around the border crossings that are largely controlled by Israel, basically trying every other means at their disposal. What should we read into that? The Gauntz visit is very significant because it's another pressure point that the administration has on the Israeli government. Gauntz, of course, is an opposition leader and he represents an alternative to Netanyahu if that government were ever to fall apart. And it's another way of signaling to Netanyahu and to the government that they're not happy with the status quo that they have other lines of influence and to the government and into Israeli politics potentially. It was journal Middle East correspondent Jared Moussen. The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a Texas law that allows police to arrest migrants who enter the US illegally and order them to leave the country. The law, known as Senate Bill 4, had been set to take effect on Saturday. However, in order issued by the Supreme Court yesterday, it means it's now been placed on hold for at least a week. Republican governor Greg Abbott signed the law in December as part of a series of border measures that have tested how far a state can go to keep migrants from entering the country, marking a legal showdown over the federal government's authority over immigration. And the primary season's busiest day, Super Tuesday, is upon us, with voters in 15 states set to cast ballots for their party's nominee for president. It could be a pivotal day for Nikki Haley's long shot bid to stop Donald Trump from securing the Republican nomination. With more than a third of all GOP delegates up for grabs today and many states awarding them on a winner-take-all basis, even strong second-place finishes could leave her empty-handed. After holding events in Virginia, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Maine in recent days, all of which vote today, Haley tried to drum up enthusiasm in Texas last night. In a general election, we're given a choice. In a primary, we make our choice. It's time for us to make that choice. And we'll have more on what to watch for as voting gets underway on this evening's What's News podcast, along with live results on WSJ.com. And finally, an experimental new drug from Vertex Pharmaceuticals could be a game-changer for pain treatment without the risk of addiction. The opioid crisis means that doctors no longer prescribe opioids as easily as they once did because of the addictive side effects, even though millions of Americans still suffer from debilitating pain. David Wainer writes about health care for the journals heard on the street column, and he says that a non-opioid drug from Vertex could pave the way for better pain killers. Think of the opportunity here, less as the big obesity bonanza bringing in tens of billions of dollars in annual sales of pharma companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, and more like the slow, but promising progress being made in fighting Alzheimer's. While its drug didn't beat opioid-based Vycadin in acute pain studies, it didn't now perform Lyrica, an older drug, in diabetic neuropathy patients. Vertex's results are likely to unleash more investment in research into this class of sodium channel blockers. And since Vertex will be able to claim its drug isn't addictive, it should establish a decent-sized market. And that is what's news for Tuesday morning. Today's show was produced by capable of it and hadimoire. We will be back tonight with a new show. And until then, thanks for listening. It's Super Tuesday and voters in 15 states are casting their ballots. And how smaller banks ran into problems when they tried to grow bigger. How did they let these risks build up? Why wasn't somebody saying, oh, you've got too much of this interest rate risk? Well, some of that was due to just how much the bank had grown. Plus, Bitcoin prices soared to a new record. It's Tuesday, March 5th. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. It's primary season's biggest day, Super Tuesday, and voters in 15 states, including California, Texas, North Carolina and Virginia are casting their ballots. Most of these states are expected to fall either solidly Democratic or Republican. Though when it comes to the general election, North Carolina is a question mark. We're also watching to see whether this will be the last stand for Nikki Haley, as she mounts a long shot bid to prevent Donald Trump from securing the GOP nomination for president. And President Biden is facing protest voting, as we saw on Michigan's primary last Tuesday from those angry over his supportive Israel's military campaign against Hamas. Let's jump in with our National Political Reporter, Eliza Collins. Welcome back Eliza. Hi, good to be here. Alright, so as we talked about last time you were here, Haley has vowed to stay in the race through Super Tuesday. So what does today mean for her presidential bid? Today really, it could be the end, although we don't know, to your point, Haley has said repeatedly she's only thought through Super Tuesday. She has no ads booked after today. She does have money if she chooses to keep going. But what she has said so far is that the nomination should not be decided off of a handful of states. Until now, really just a handful of states have voted. After tonight, we will be more than halfway there. And Haley is not able to significantly turn things around. Her argument gets even harder. So then how close could Trump get to securing the nomination after tonight? Trump will not have enough delegates after tonight, even if he wins every state, but he will be very close. He could secure them all as soon as March 12th, if he wins by wide enough margins tonight and then on March 12th. Otherwise, by March 19th, I mean, we're looking really within days to a couple of weeks away from Trump becoming the Republican nominee. More than a dozen states are holding primaries today and you've flagged some to keep an especially close eye on. What are you watching? Well, I like California because it's a traditionally blue state, but it will matter tonight on the GOP side because if Trump clears a majority of the vote in California, he will get all 169 delegates. And that is a huge boost in his quest for the nomination. Haley really needs to keep him below that 50% line if she wants to get delegates. Also in California, separate from the presidential race is a closely watched Senate primary. We expect it to elect a Democrat for the open Senate seat come November. But what we are watching for is who ends up in that general election from tonight. And it's been three major names. Congressman Adam Schiff and Congresswoman Katie Porter along with Congresswoman Barbara Lee have been the three Democrats vying for the seat. Schiff and Porter have proven to be some of the strongest fundraisers in the House and really in politics in general. But there is a Republican Steve Garvey, a former baseball player, is also running. He looks at this moment like he might take the second slot. Adam Schiff looks like he's going to take the first. So the question is, is it going to be basically Adam Schiff's Senate seat that we would know today? Or will it be a matchup between Schiff and Porter that will be expensive and ugly going into November? You mentioned North Carolina. North Carolina is the only battleground state voting on Tuesday. So we're really interested to see who shows up for which candidate we like to watch primaries as sort of an indicator for November to watch how key voting groups will vote. Let's talk about President Biden in Michigan. Some voters cast their ballots is uncommitted in protest of his foreign policy, especially concerning the Israel-Hamos war. Is that protest movement growing and what's at stake for him tonight? So similar to what we were saying about Trump, we expect President Biden to be the Democratic nominee in November. Like Trump, he could secure the nomination as early as this month. We expect him to win all of the states tonight, barring any major surprises. But what we are watching for is signs of weakness. And one huge sign of weakness we've seen with his base is this frustration from progressives and young voters over US support for Israel. And it's war against Hamas, particularly for the humanitarian crisis going on in Gaza. So we are watching several other states where there have been efforts, including Minnesota, to show protest votes. And I don't know how big those margins will be or even if they will be organized in the way they were for Michigan. But that's certainly something I imagine the Biden campaign is going to be watching tonight. You can follow along as results start coming in from around 6 p.m. Eastern time with our live coverage at WSJ.com. Sticking with political news, Arizona Senator Kirsten Sinema has announced she won't run for re-election and will retire after this term. Sinema, an independent who left the Democratic Party in 2022, played a pivotal role in bipartisan deals, but angered progressives. She would have faced an uphill re-election battle had she decided to run. The race to replace her could now decide control of the Senate, where Democrats and Independents aligned with the party currently have a thin 51-49 majority. Bitcoin prices soared to a new record today in a rally that's defied the expectations of analysts and investors. The biggest cryptocurrency by market value briefly crossed $69,000, surpassing its prior all-time high from late 2021. That's according to Dow Jones market data. Cryptocurrency's reporter, Kate Lennastrov. The Valley has, in part, been driven by the approval of exchange traded funds that are able to hold Bitcoin itself. That has led to an increased demand for Bitcoin. But we were looking at some data which suggests that a lot of the buying of Bitcoin, at least from small traders or large traders, seems to be happening on finance. It seems to indicate that a lot of the interest is coming from outside the US, because finances in XUS exchange. It seems like there's a lot of interest just globally in Bitcoin pushing up the price. Coming up, larger banks have more insulation from the pressures their smaller peers face. But there are risks in going from a mid-size lender to a bigger one. We'll have more after the break. Hey, what's news fans? Listen up. But that's not all. So we know they definitely have something for you. That's amazon.com slash what's news. It's just that easy. China plans to boost its military spending by 7.2% this year. That matches the pace of last year's expansion and builds on more than 20 years of continued defense upgrades. Chinese leader Xi Jinping is on an expensive campaign to modernize the country's armed forces. According to a draft report, total military expenditure this year will reach the equivalent of about $232 billion. The International Criminal Court based in the Hague has issued a rest warrants for two Russian commanders accused of targeting Ukraine's power grid. They're charged with directing missiles against Ukrainian power plants and distribution stations. Acts that would violate the humanitarian law prohibition on targeting civilian facilities. The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to request for comment. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky welcomed the ICC's action. And in Haiti, heavily armed gangs freed close to 5,000 prisoners and forced the closure of two airports late Monday. The survival of Haiti's government is in doubt, though it has imposed a curfew of 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. through Wednesday. Security in Haiti began deteriorating sharply over the weekend when a coalition of gangs targeted prisons and police stations. How big is too big when it comes to banks? Recent regional banking crises have revived debates over the size of lenders. That's because larger banks have been more insulated from some of the pressures roiling their regional peers. But expanding also comes with challenges and risks. Welcome back, Tellus. Thanks for having me. So the past disability is not as simple as just growing bigger as we learned from near community bank or that's right. Growing a small or medium sized bank into a larger bank is we are seeing a very complicated thing. One of the challenges is simply fast growth at a bank can bring with it lots of changes in the nature of the bank's business, how the bank manages its various risks and other exposures and how the bank is managed. The US banking regulatory system is broken up in many cases by tears of banks. That is by design. Congress has over the years passed various laws that suggest that rules should be tailored to the size of banks with the presumption being that bigger banks are riskier and therefore should be the most heavily regulated that smaller banks maybe they are at more individual risk of failure. But they are not as systemically important and therefore it's not as necessary to regulate them to the same degree. So what happens as a bank grows bigger in some cases that means that the bank has to change its practices dramatically. It also means that different kinds of supervisors, different kinds of examiners that are looking at the bank start to take over. And what we've learned from the post-mortem reports done by regulators after the crisis last March was that sometimes those transitions can be very challenging, right? So you mentioned last March and the banking crisis back then it seems like it was something similar that happened with Silicon Valley Bank. Silicon Valley Bank grew enormously during the pandemic. It gathered a lot more deposits. It grew in asset size. That was a big part of the story of how it got to what eventually happened in March of 2023. They took in a lot more deposits. So Silicon Valley Bank was growing a lot during that time. It grew tremendously and it would jump up between regulatory tiers. And when the Fed looked at, they said, okay, what are the things that led up to the crisis last year? One thing they found was that, well, it looked like that was a difficult transition. Different groups of supervisors would take over for another one. How one level of supervisors looked at it versus another wasn't necessarily consistent. And so banks getting bigger has been a big part of some of the recent crises and other concerns that we've seen about banks. This reminds me a lot of the debates over too big to fail. But if the solution is not growing bigger, what is the solution? Should banks grow smaller? What's the answer? Well, some people might say that you should flatten out regulation. Maybe all banks, regardless of their size, should be regulated the same or very similarly. Maybe that would mean that banks aren't hopping between tiers. But again, the legislative preference and the preference of a lot of people in this country would be that we don't want small banks to be as regulated as big banks. We also like having lots of banks. There are lots of people who think that having tons of smaller banks is good for customers. It's good for communities, especially in parts of the country where that are more rural or that aren't necessarily served by a very large bank because that bank just doesn't see a lot of potential in a small town. And so it's not easy to say, okay, let's just have a bunch of very large banks. And some people would say that that pushes the burden to taxpayers to backstop all these too big to fail banks. But it does suggest that there just needs to be maybe more thought and attention paid to how banks get bigger. Banking is just a really tricky thing to do. And maybe the answer ultimately is that we're going to have bank failures from time to time. And we need to learn to just sort of accept that as part of the process. Maybe we need to think about expanding deposit insurance to a wider range of customers. Maybe the accounts of an account that goes over the $250,000 limit, but belongs to a small business. Maybe that should be protected by deposit insurance, even though it's a relatively large account or a business account. So there's a lot of different ways that you can imagine solving this. But I don't think we're anywhere close to a consensus about which of those paths makes the most sense. And that's what's news for this Tuesday afternoon. Today's show was produced by Pierre Bienem and Anthony Vancey, with supervising producer Michael Kusmedi's. We'll be back with a new show tomorrow morning.\",\"Hey, What's News listeners. It's Sunday, March 24th. I'm Annmarie Fertoli. And this is What's News Sunday, the show where we tackle the big questions about the biggest stories in the news by reaching out to our colleagues across the newsroom to help explain what's happening in our world. This week we're answering your questions about food price inflation at the grocery store and at restaurants. It's not your imagination. We're spending more on food, a lot more. As we reported in February, it's been three decades since Americans have spent this much of their income on food. Even though inflation is easing, food prices are still sticky. By way of comparison, back in 1991, according to the Agriculture Department, US consumers spent 11.4% of their disposable personal income on food. And today, USDA data shows we're spending about the same, 11.3% of our disposable income on food. And as Americans are spending, shrinkflation has become a hot topic again. It's when companies shrink their products but not the price. President Biden even referenced it during his State of the Union address earlier this month. The snack companies think you won't notice if they change the size of the bag and put a hell of a lot fewer, same size bag, put fewer chips in it. No, I'm not joking. It's called shrinkflation. It's happening at restaurants too. You may have noticed menu prices have risen. Labor Department data shows prices for food eaten away from home were up 30% in January, compared with the same month in 2019. So how did we get here and how are companies and consumers coping? Welcome, Heather. Thanks so much. So let's start with how we got here. Here's a question from one of our listeners, Anne Palladis. She says, \\\"What is the primary driver of food inflation? Labor cost? I belong to a 20 week farm share program, and the program fee increased by 20%, yet the sun and the rain still shine, and can't imagine seeds cost that much more, and they are a minor part of the food cost.\\\" We've talked a lot on What's News about persistent price pressures, some that just no matter what, seem not to ease with the rest of inflation. I think everyone sees the inflation that has taken place at grocery stores, at restaurants. I mean, the last couple of years, prices have just gone up by a really exceptional amount that has accumulated. I asked our colleague Jesse Newman, who covers food and agriculture, why food prices are so sticky. She says part of the reason is because once those prices go up, food companies are reluctant to bring them back down again. After all, food isn't one of those discretionary goods you only buy every once in a while or can put off. We've got to eat. But, Heather, what else is going on here? Why else is food staying so expensive right now? There's a lot of inputs in food. So that cocoa that isn't a chocolate bar, it's really expensive right now. That is not going down. Maybe you're seeing certain parts of what you buy at the grocery store get a little more reasonable. Say that the oils that got shot up during the earlier part of the Ukraine war have gotten more reasonable. Other parts haven't. Food is complex. But I think the other really important part is labor. Labor is not going down. And particularly for restaurants, that labor cost is growing, whether it's from minimum wage increases or just the competition for labor. And given that labor is such a big part of what factors into a restaurant's cost, it's not going down and so those prices are not going down as well. So we mentioned shrinkflation, as did the president a bit earlier. That's one of the ways we've seen companies deal with higher food costs. One of our listeners, David Franco, has a question about how companies respond. I have heard food companies highlight the strength of the consumer when discussing their ability to keep prices high. However, consumers are dipping further into their savings to handle higher costs. Is there more that food companies can do to reduce prices in the short term? One of the big questions is are food companies making a profit off all this price increase and that's something we are trying to investigate ourselves. What's the dynamic between profits and price? The food companies tend to say that they are only increasing prices just to cover their costs, but it is a valid question whether they have shareholders to respond to as well, and there's different dynamics that influence these food companies when it comes to price. So what are companies doing to bring the price down? I mean, on the restaurant side, they're offering deals and discounts. You could say that about grocery stores too. I mean, they are trying to bring back some promotions because they realize that a lot of consumers are feeling fatigued. So that's not necessarily dropping the prices for good, but it is trying to incentivize people to come back by offering buy one get one free or coupons or deals on their apps. A lot of grocers and restaurants have been doing that. We've seen other solutions used by companies to deal with food price inflation. Wendy's got a lot of flak last month for its dynamic pricing strategy. The company got so much backlash, it had to release a statement explicitly disavowing surge pricing. Yes, it was a pretty innocuous comment by Wendy's during their earnings call where their new CEO, this is his first earnings call, talked about different things they're looking to do. But then they also made a comment about dynamic pricing is something that they're exploring, but they really didn't give much detail at all about it, and they definitely did not say surge pricing in there. So it was not a good PR day for Wendy's, that's for sure and certainly a tough intro to giving earnings calls for the CEO. But, Heather, don't companies use this strategy, increasing prices when there's higher demand? There's been different prices for different parts of the day forever. We all love happy hours, and happy hours have been around for a long time, and that's an example of discounted pricing at a slower shoulder part of the day where a bar tends to be less busy. So this is also flipping the switch and when there's higher demand for a restaurant, particularly on let's say on a weekend, when it's coming to delivery and that delivery occasion, restaurants are now experimenting with increasing prices then. Coming up, we've covered how we got here and how companies are handling food price inflation, but how about us, the consumers? We'll get to more of your comments and questions after the break. Heather, more than 600 readers have commented on your article showing the broad range of ways consumers are dealing with higher prices. Let's talk about some of them. This is a tough one for me, but going out to eat less frequently. Listener Vincent LoNigro says-Vincent LoNigro: How do I deal with food cost inflation at restaurants? So in addition to eating out less, my girlfriend and I try to avoid restaurants with the credit card surcharge. When we can't avoid those establishments, I always pay cash to avoid the fee. Familiar workarounds that you've heard before, Heather? Yeah. Consumers really are hunting for ways that they can save money and are really focused on restaurants and what they can do. One thing is just the, \\\"I'm not going to restaurants anymore.\\\" There are some consumers who are just skipping restaurants altogether and just cooking really a lot more at home. There's others that are going out for lunch instead of dinner. I mean, dinner tends to be more expensive. But I talked to a fair amount of people who are just saying, \\\"I'm just not going out to fast food period. It's just gotten too expensive and it's not worth it.\\\" Others are really looking for those deals on the apps. All the restaurants now really offer a lot of promotions. A lot of consumers and readers are really making sure they download all those apps and use it anytime there's a coupon. Speaking of looking for a deal, my mother does this. She's been known to go to three grocery stores in a single day looking for the best price. I'd rather stick to one location and pay a little more, plus there's added gas money that you're paying for that. Some of our commenters said they like to go to Aldi or Lidl for deals, even if the general food selection there is smaller. Are you seeing shopping habits changing more in this way? Absolutely. Yeah. Particularly Aldi, just because in part because there's more locations, and Lidl, are really becoming popular with people who maybe wouldn't shop there in the past. Maybe they'd go to Whole Foods or Wegmans or just more upscale stores are finding what they need at some of these kind of Aldi, Lidl, type grocery stores, which offer pretty good private label goods and they're just cheaper. So a lot of people are switching either part of their shopping or all of their shopping. Some people are going to Walmart more. Some people are just trading down to the Costco, the cheaper option for groceries because just their normal, more mainstream grocery store, it feels too expensive to them. And to pick up on that point, one of our listeners, Sharon Felton from Underhill, Vermont says she only buys what's on sale and then plans her meals around those sale items. So once a month she even skips the supermarket trip and just eats whatever's in the pantry. Yeah, I actually, I do think that is a trend, that a lot of the readers we talked to said they make sure that they look at their pantry before they go to the grocery store. So they really take stock of what they have in their cabinets before going to buy more because they want to make sure to use the food they already have and not waste food. That's also a broader theme. We also did talk to people who said they're really planning the meals around things that are more affordable, more economical, just not as exotic or expensive ingredients to stretch their money further. So, here's another creative solution from one of our listeners, Nancy Randall from Houston, Texas. WeNancy Randall: Are virtually eating out of our freezer these days instead of buying meat in the grocery store. We hunt and gather our food. We hunt deer every year and we fish. And so we've been eating fish and venison probably up to four times a week and going through our freezer a lot quicker than we normally do because of the food prices in the grocery store. Heather, she's hunting and gathering. Yeah, she was not alone either. It was really remarkable how many folks wrote to us and said that they are hunting. We also had people who have little gardens in there by their homes and are really saving money. You have to know what you're doing. I mean, they have to know how to hunt and you have to know how to grow vegetables to be able to make this successful and actually save you money. But if that's your hobby already and you're passionate about it and you're good at it, then go for it. Heather, one last topic I'd like to hit. That certainly came across from a lot of our commenters. People seem annoyed and even angry. Consumer spending, as we know, drives three quarters of the US economy. Are we seeing consumers pull back in a significant way due to higher food prices? Yeah. The consumer sentiment has not been great for a while and one of the reasons is some of these food prices. People see prices change at their grocery store, at their restaurant, and it adds up. It's something that's very in your face. It's like gasoline prices. You notice it and you get irritated. It's like, \\\"Why aren't the prices like they used to be? Please bring me back to 2019 or 2009.\\\" And for some of these food companies, it is impacting the volume of business. It is impacting their sales. When people get irritated, and irritated for this long, that food price has gone up, they do start walking away. Is there an end in sight? Broader inflation's easing, food prices, as we've talked about, are one of those sticky categories. When might food inflation come down or better yet stop altogether? Well, if you look at the inflation numbers at the grocery store, it has flattened out. There's some analysts who say there might be deflation this year. Some categories might get cheaper. Restaurant prices though are still going up. And again, a lot of that has to do with that labor. That labor cost is not going down and restaurants need workers. So I wouldn't expect restaurant prices to fall, but they should go up much more slowly than they were. Thank you so much, Heather. Thank you. And that's it for What's News Sunday for March 24th. Today's show was produced by Charlotte Gartenberg with supervising producer Michael Kosmides. We got help from our deputy editors, Scott Saloway and Chris Zinsli. I'm Annmarie Fertoli. We'll be back on Monday morning with a new show. Thanks for listening.\",\"It is the end of an era as Japan quits negative interest rates. Plus Nvidia reveals new AI chips at its latest conference, dubbed AI-woodstock, and Israel sends officials to Washington amid Biden's growing concerns over a potential invasion of Rafah. Our position is that Hamas should not be allowed a safe haven in Rafah or anywhere else but a major ground operation there would be a mistake. It's Tuesday, March 19th. We begin in Japan this morning where the country's central bank has ended a historic run of negative interest rates, raising rates for the first time in 17 years. It marks a milestone for one of the world's biggest economies amid a strengthening job market and a new era of stable inflation. Joining me now is the Journal's Tokyo Bureau Chief, Peter Landers. Peter, a significant move from the BOJ today. Tell us what did they say? They say Japan is on the road to stable inflation of about 2%. We've already been above that level for about two years now, and in light of that, the Bank of Japan says it's time to end these extraordinary monetary policy steps that it's taken over the last 14 years or so. They've ended negative interest rates. That was one of the most prominent steps. They've also ended an attempt to target the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds. That's something that central banks don't normally do. The Bank of Japan has been doing that for nearly eight years. They were initially setting a target of around zero, now the target is being scrapped entirely. Now, the purpose of this was to control not just short-term rates, which is the traditional ambit of the central bank, but also longer term rates. So a company borrowing money that it needs to pay back over 10 years, that would be linked to the interest rate on the 10-year Japanese Government Bond. So if that interest rate is zero, that means that companies and consumers can borrow at extremely low rates, and that was the point of having this yield curve control. What the Bank of Japan is saying now is that it's okay to let the market determine that interest rate on the 10-year Japanese Government Bond. That's what markets usually do. And right now it's just slightly above 0.7%. So it's still very easy to get a loan at a low interest rate in Japan if you're a qualified borrower, whether you're a business or a person buying a home, interest Rates are still very low, and that is why the Bank of Japan felt that it didn't need to control that interest rate so strictly. And Peter, this comes off the back of a rebounding economy, right? Something we've been reporting on in recent months, not least last week, when the biggest trade union secured major wage increases for workers there. I think those wage numbers were a big deal for the Bank of Japan, showing that at least at large companies in Japan, the average wage increase this year is going to top 5%, and that's the biggest we've seen since 1991. So what they've really wanted to see all along is what they call a virtuous cycle of wages and prices. And we've had prices going up 2,3 4% over the last couple of years, and the question was whether wages would follow. Because until now, wages have been going up a little bit, but a lot of people are actually losing out in their daily lives because they're paying a lot more and they're only earning a tiny bit more. Now finally, with these wage numbers in place, the Bank of Japan can say people are seeing the benefits of positive inflation. The tight job market companies are passing on some of their higher profits to their workers, and that signals a healthy economy that means they don't need to have some of these emergency monetary policy steps. So how does this compare with other economies around the world? In the US the Fed begins, its meeting today, but there the conversation is quite different to what Japanese policy makers are dealing with. That's right, and the Bank of Japan is saying its monetary policy is still extraordinarily accommodative, they call it. That means it's easy to get credit at a very low interest rate. So the policy rate that they're setting today is between zero and 0.1%. Now, that's hardly tight monetary policy. In the US it's above 5%. So there's still a large interest rate, a gap, between the US and Japan, and that has tended to weaken the yen. The yen is in fact weakening a bit further today in light of the Bank of Japan saying that they don't intend to have a series of rapid race increases after today's action. Okay, so an improving economy, but not quite matching the strength of the US economy. Are there other caveats here that investors need to be aware of? I would say two caveats. One is domestic, that people in Japan, they don't actually feel the economy is all that great. They have been hit by higher inflation and just now they're beginning to see these wage increases. And so consumer spending in Japan is actually not all that strong. And then the other risk is more external, pointed out by the Bank of Japan itself today. They actually took a cautious outlook about the global economy. They said Japan's economy is likely to be under downward pressure stemming from a slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economy. So countries like China are having a lot of economic difficulties. Even the US economy is not growing all that rapidly, and those are the two biggest markets overseas for Japanese goods. Further, we have of course, a US presidential election this year. All kinds of uncertainties in overseas markets that the Bank of Japan is saying might require a revision to the economic outlook. Sounds like a case of wait and see Peter. Thanks so much for talking us through the news of the day. That was Peter Landers, our Tokyo Bureau chief. Sure thing. Another keenly watched market event was Nvidia's annual tech conference last night where it unveiled its highly anticipated new chips, Blackwell. Roughly 11,000 people filled the SAP Center in San Jose, California to hear Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talk about the $2 trillion company's next generation of chips and how they will power artificial intelligence. According to Huang, the chips are much faster and larger than their predecessors and will be available later this year. With investments in AI skyrocketing Nvidia's quarterly sales have more than tripled over the past year. Meanwhile, shares in Google parent Alphabet jumped 6% Monday following a report by Bloomberg that Apple may use Google's generative AI tool called Gemini to power features in upcoming iPhone models. Katy Barnato is a markets editor for the journal and she says the report helped fuel a wider rally in tech shares yesterday as investors continue to focus on any and all AI news. Players like Apple, which haven't been able to make their footstep yet on AI, are really trying very hard now to catch up there. So that's pretty exciting because it involves two huge tech players potentially working together. That said, it remains unclear whether such a deal will come to fruition and Apple is also said to have previously met with OpenAI for discussions on licensing their large language model. And more women are choosing the abortion pill. We've got those stories and more after the break. It comes after the Israeli leader and President Biden spoke for the first time in over a month yesterday amid a growing divide between the two allies. Biden warned Netanyahu against an offensive in Rafah where more than a million displaced Palestinians are sheltering. Here's White House National Security Advisor, Jake SullivanJake Sullivan: From the US perspective, this is not a question of defeating Hamas. And anytime I hear an argument that says, if you don't smash into Rafah, you can't defeat Hamas, I say, that is a straw man. Our view is that there are ways for Israel to prevail in this conflict to secure its long-term future, to end the terror threat from Gaza and not smash into Rafah. That's what we're going to present in this integrated way when this team comes. We'll have a back and forth and we'll let you know how that unfolds as we go forward. The US and its allies have also been pushing Netanyahu's government to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza as signs of widespread hunger in the enclave mount. Meanwhile, lawmakers working on six annual spending bills have resolved a last-minute roadblock over border funding, setting the stage for Congress to review and approve the legislation ahead of a partial government shutdown this weekend. We've learned that congressional negotiators from both parties late Monday, reached a deal on border security funding. Though it is unclear whether that includes additional money for enforcing immigration laws as Republicans had wanted or for the White House priorities that the GOP previously saw as deal-breakers. The legislation will need to be drafted and circulated to members in coming days, potentially pushing a vote right up against the Friday funding deadline. More women are choosing the abortion pill after a clampdown on abortion rights in many US states changed when, how and where they get abortions following the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022. The procedure made up almost two thirds of all abortions in the US last year, up from 53% in 2020 according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. The number and rate of abortions performed in the US also climbed last year even with near-total bans on the procedure in more than a dozen states. Access to the abortion pill has grown thanks to policy changes, including one that allows mifepristone, one of two drugs used in medication abortion, to be delivered by mail-order pharmacies. The Supreme Court plans to hear this month, arguments to challenge the relaxation of restrictions around mifepristone. Guaranteed income programs have sprung up in cities across the US in a bid to help households with low income receive monthly payments with no strings attached. The programs reflect a growing sentiment among economists and democratic circles that this is one of the most effective ways to distribute funds and support struggling Americans. But as US policy reporter, Andrew Restuccia explains, such initiatives are drawing pushback from Republicans. Dozens of cities and counties across the United States are implementing what they call guaranteed income programs. And that can be anywhere from $500 to $1000. Of course, detractors worry that the money could be used for non-necessities. So the data tell us though, is that the money tends to be used in almost all cases, for necessities, bills and groceries and things like that. This idea of giving people money directly is gaining more and more popularity across the country. On the federal level, there had been dalliances or experiments with this idea. During the pandemic, Republicans, both at the state and federal level, are working to limit or restrict these efforts, arguing that they're unfair and there's the potential for abuse of the money.

US realtors grapple with a shift in how they get paid after a landmark settlement. And, Russia's backdoor to the global banking system is slamming shut. There is evidence that the US actions, whether business to the United Arab Emirates or sanctions have had an impact in Russia's trading activities, but also the ability for oligarchs to put the money safely in the UAE. Plus, US businesses want to revive expired tax breaks. Why Senate Republicans aren't on board? It's Tuesday, March 19th. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. The Supreme Court has rejected an emergency appeal from the Biden administration to block Texas from implementing its own criminal law against illegal immigration. The administration argued states can't interfere with federal authority over the border. The Texas law makes illegal border crossing a state crime and allows state officials to conduct deportations. The measure has been on hold as the Supreme Court weighed the government's request to halt Texas from implementing it while litigation continues in the lower courts. The high court's order is not a final decision, but it signals the Texas law may fair better than a similar Arizona statute the high court struck down in 2012. A bill that would revive expired tax breaks for businesses is stalled in the Senate. The bipartisan bill had soared through the house earlier this year and it was backed by a broad coalition of supporters. But it's hit a wall in the Senate. Republicans in the chamber who typically back tax breaks for businesses aren't budging. But some businesses say it's a now or never moment. Joining me now to explain is our US tax policy reporter Richard Rubin. Welcome back, Richard. Sure. Thanks for having me. So Richard, Republicans typically support measures like this connected to businesses and these extensions would revive tax breaks for research and equipment spending, so why aren't GOP lawmakers behind the bill this time? It's because of other things in the bill. So they're really not having much in the way of disagreement about the business tax breaks, which are about half the bill. But there's another half of the bill. And part of the deal to get this bill through the house was there was an agreement where Republicans would get the business tax break, which some Democrats were fine with, and Democrats would get an expansion of the child tax credit, in some cases to families who didn't work in the particular tax year but might've worked in the year before. And that's been a problem for Republicans in the Senate, that they are concerned about this provision that would expand the child tax credit and allow people to use last year's income to qualify. And then the other thing too is senators, to put it simply, like to senate. And what I mean by that is that senators like to have the ability to amend bills, to change bills, to offer ideas to shape things. Here we have the reverse where the house has found the bipartisan deal and it's the Senate that is saying, \\\"Whoa, whoa. We want a chance to change this.\\\" And then there's a third element, which is the election, where Senate Republicans who are in the minority now, 51-49, have a really good chance of being in the majority next year. So they are thinking, \\\"Well, maybe we've got other tax bills we've got to push through next year. Maybe we should just deal with all of this then instead of cutting a deal with Democrats now.\\\" Businesses have framed this as a now or never moment. What do they say will happen if these tax breaks aren't revived? The biggest impact here is really about the research deductions in small businesses. So the 2017 tax law, they were looking for ways to raise money to offset the cost of cutting corporate tax rates. And so what they did was they said, \\\"Okay, starting in 2022, companies, instead of deducting research costs, immediately you got to spread those over five years. And everyone's like, \\\"Okay, fine. Congress will figure that out. They won't let that happen.\\\" And then it did happen starting in 2022. And for large businesses, think about Northrop Grumman and Lockheed, your big defense contractors really do a lot of research and are hit by this. For them it's a cash flow issue. They have higher tax bills now, smaller tax bills later. They don't enjoy that, but they're liquid enough that they can kind of handle that. For some of these smaller businesses that I've talked to, it's existential. They went from, for tax purposes, kind of barely breaking even, to now because they don't have those deductions for wages, showing these enormous profits in paying all these taxes. They don't have the ability to be nearly as liquid as a big company. Richard, given that history you just explained, I am wondering how this fight right now might impact the overall relationship between Republicans and US businesses who typically have a pretty cozy relationship. Are we seeing that start to change? It's definitely fraying. It's really about where the things that businesses want on taxes rank priority wise for Senate Republicans, and they're just a little bit lower right now. So it's not a full crack up of that relationship, but it's maybe not quite as tight as it was. And there's just a lot of frustration in the business community about exactly how this has been stalled right now and they're pushing all the buttons they've got. After selling ice cream for more than a hundred years, Ben & Jerry's owner, Unilever, may be losing its sweet tooth. Today, the company said it plans to separate its ice cream division, which also makes Walls, Talenti, Popsicle and Klondike into a standalone business. It's enlisting the business as a separate entity is the most likely outcome. A sale is also possible. Unilever and Anglo-Dutch Company also announced 7,500 mainly white collar job cuts as part of a restructuring program aimed at saving about $870 million over the next three years. Disney and its CEO, Bob Iger, got a big endorsement today and an ongoing proxy fight against activist investor Nelson Peltz. George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars and one of Disney's biggest individual shareholders, said he's confident in the company's leadership, adding, \\\"Creating magic is not for amateurs.\\\" He also expressed confidence in Iger's leadership and track record at the company. Peltz' Hedge Fund, Trian Partners, has been trying to seize two board seats. Disney's also facing a challenge from another activist fund, Blackwells Capital, which is trying to gain shareholders support and seats to challenge Iger's strategy. Coming up, realtors are re-examining their careers after a groundbreaking settlement that could change the way they get paid. More after the break. Last week we told you about a groundbreaking settlement that could fundamentally change the way Americans buy and sell homes. On Friday, the National Association of Realtors announced it had settled legal claims that the real estate industry conspired to keep commissions artificially high. The agreement will give buyers more negotiating power over fees and will likely change how much of a home sales price will go to agents. That's left realtors grappling with a seismic shift in how they'll get paid. And many of the more than 1 million people who broker home buying and selling are now re-examining their careers. Welcome, Joseph. Joseph  Thanks for having me. So Joseph, this settlement would really be a big change for buyers and sellers. We talked on the show last week about how they're negotiating power could increase. But on the other side of this, what could it mean for realtors?Joseph  So this is going to change how realtors make money. Typically in the past, the realtors, both for the seller and for the buyer, they would split this commission that they get whenever a home is sold. Those terms were basically set by the seller. Now, those guarantees for the buyer's agent aren't necessarily going to be there in the future. And so this is going to give buyers the chance to negotiate the fees that are paid to their agent for the first time. I'm sure you've been hearing a range of reactions among realtors. How are they grappling with this settlement and these potential changes?Joseph  For some folks, they're still trying to fully digest what this settlement means and what all the requirements are and they're still trying to figure out basically how to move forward and deal with some of the ramifications of the decision. Right now, it's not really clear if sellers are going to continue to want to pay the commission fee for the buyer's agent. Another question that is there for the seller's agents is that if the sellers no longer are paying a commission to the buyer's agent, does that mean the overall net proceeds from the sale, is there going to be a deduction? So a lot of real estate agents are kind of grappling on what that means and how they can balance everything to make everything work still. Was anyone you spoke to not too concerned, thinking maybe this isn't as big of a shift as we might imagine?Joseph  Yes. I heard from some agents who feel like the status quo was probably going to be in place in the short term at least because they mentioned some of the benefits that sellers get when they pay the fees for the buyer's agent. Many agents I spoke with said it's oftentimes in the seller's interest to continue to pay the fees to make sure that they have a smooth process and to make sure that they have as many different prospective buyers and potential offers on hand as possible. So people think that the sellers will continue to pay these commission fees because it might be in their best interest. Did you talk to anyone who's ready to throw in the towel and leave the industry?Joseph  Some of the people that we spoke with, agents that were working part-time, felt like it might make their situation a little bit too difficult. And brokers who manage multiple agents told me that they think that if you're going to continue being a real estate agent after this, it might be a little bit hard to do it on a part-time basis if you're only relying on a few transactions every year. And that likely means that the field is going to be comprised more of full-time agents going forward. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US and Europe tried to sever Moscow from the Western financial system. But, Russia always seemed to find workarounds. Now though, efforts to close such loopholes appear to be paying off. Dubai's main state-owned bank has scaled back its Russia business shutting some accounts held by oligarchs and traders of Russian oil. And Turkish lenders are growing more wary. Potentially, the new avenues that are opening up for the Russian companies selling oil or the wealthy Russians are places like Hong Kong and China typically. They're still fairly welcoming for these kind of transactions. Initially, it would've been very difficult for the US to balance its relationship. Obviously the Emiratis are buying large amounts of armament from the US. They are a key ally in the region, especially facing countries like Iran for instance. But it seems they kind of found a way, the Emiratis, to keep their economic interest sort of afloat without too much damage from the reduction of their relationship with Russian oil companies and wealthy Russians. So that took some time. I think the impression in the US is it was going too far. It was enabling the war efforts in Ukraine and it had to be somehow contained. And that's effectively what's happened. And finally, it turns out that to reach frequent flyer status, you don't even need to fly frequently. That's good news for me since I don't like flying anyway. Carriers like American Airlines have shifted from tying elite status to miles earned on flights to consumer spending on things like linked credit cards, branded shopping portals and other methods. That's created some tension between frequent flyers at American Airlines who earn their status at 30,000 feet after all and these so-called frequent buyers who can earn their status right here on the ground. Only American has so fully embraced the fact that you don't even have to get on an airplane to achieve elite status that American offers to its flyers, which is Executive Platinum. And so the people that have earned their status the old-fashioned way are a little upset that if they're in line for an upgrade, a lot of times somebody who's just simply spent their way to a higher status will jump them in the line even though that person might not fly nearly as much as the person who's lower down on the upgrade list. So there's some tension there. And some of the people that I talked to said that they had actually kind of been bullied off some of the Facebook and Reddit forums devoted to elite status because of this. Earned points are also creating a new battleground for couples. If both spouses have their own accounts and credit cards, who gets to pay household expenses and rack up all those points? The director of American Airlines loyalty program said the company doesn't want to sow marital discord, but that \\\"some friendly competition is always good.\\\" And that's What's News for this Tuesday afternoon. Today's show was produced by Pierre Bienaim\\u00e9 and Anthony Bansie with supervising producer Michael Kosmides. We'll be back with a new show tomorrow morning. Thanks for listening.\",\"Hey listeners, it's Saturday March 9th. Our look at the biggest stock moves of the week and the news that drove them. Let's get to it. It is March, which for college basketball means March Madness. And who knows, maybe for markets too. With all three of the major indexes coming off their fourth straight month of games, we're watching to see if the market can keep up its hot streak. The big story behind last week's rally was Nvidia, the chipmaker and de facto poster child of this AI boom that's powering the market higher. But some of these AI sensitive stocks have been volatility too, and we did see tech shares waffle a bit this week. Still, that didn't stop the S&P 500 from hitting a new record close on Thursday, ending about 1% higher at 5,157. For those of you keeping score at home, that is now the 16th record close of 2024. Speaking of the AI boom and last week's Nvidia high, investors were watching Broadcom this week. Like Nvidia, Broadcom's another chipmaker that's reaping all these AI rewards. And you can tell just by looking at stock, which has more than doubled in the past year. But unlike Nvidia's great performance last week, Broadcom's quarterly report didn't impress investors much. The good news was that its sales got a boost thanks to AI Fuel Chip Demand, and thanks to its acquisition of the software maker VMware. Just last year, Broadcom closed the $69 billion deal, which is one of the biggest tech deals ever. The bad news was that its quarterly net profit missed expectations, which was also thanks to its acquisition of VMware. Specifically, costs related to closing that giant deal. So it was kind of a double-edged sword for the quarter. Broadcom shares fell after our Thursday, and ended 7% lower on Friday. But an important takeaway here is that Broadcom sees a stronger year ahead for AI demand. And we all know what they say, right? Rising AI Tides, lift all chipmaker boats. I mean, that is what they say, right? Now, let's talk about one of my favorite places to spend a Saturday afternoon target. See, if I want to impress you all, I should say a museum or the library, but you know what? I just, I gotta keep it real. So Target set its sites on a turnaround since its annual revenue fell in 2023, which was its first decline since 2016. Some of the company's plans to juice up sales and store traffic are long-term, like opening up hundreds of new locations and investing in improvements over the next decade. And some are short-term, like unveiling Target Circle 360, aka its new paid membership program. It gets you things like free-to-day shipping and free same-day delivery on orders over $35. And some of these perks may sound a little familiar. Investors were pretty stoked about it, although sending shares up 12% Tuesday, and the stock held on to most of those gains throughout the week. So we'll just have to see if the company can hit its targets. Sorry, low-hanging fruit, I just can't help myself. And last but not least, I want to give you an update on Rivian. Rivians, the electric vehicle or EV startup, I told you about a couple weeks back, it's one of several EV makers that's struggling with a slowdown in demand. And we talked about one of the big issues with EVs, right? The price tag. People just aren't its game to fork over 70 grand for an electric car. And the lack of EV buzz shows in Rivian stock price shares have fallen more than 40% in 2024 so far. So it was big news that Rivian unveiled two new, more affordable SUV models. And the starting price for one is $45,000. It's a lot of money to be sure, but compared to 70 grand, it's a deal. And it was great news for Rivian stock. On Thursday, shares jumped 13% and ended the week higher. Oh, I almost forgot. Those new cars, not just cheaper, they've got glove boxes. And I'm actually being serious, owners of the older models that didn't have glove boxes complained and Rivian listened. And now you know what's news in markets this week.

The fire department's describing it as a mass casualty incident, with a number of people and vehicles in the water. The moment the ship struck a column of the bridge was caught on camera, you can see a giant section dropping into the Put Up Score River. It happened at 130 in the morning, local time. The bridge is more than a mile and a half long. Synergy Marine Group confirmed its Singapore flagged container ship, Dali, collided with a pillar of the bridge. You can get more on this story at Royces.com. It was reported that the U.N. Security Council, as a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, was adopted. A U.S. abstention meant it could pass, unlike previously when the U.S. had vetoed. Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansor. This must be a turning point. This must lead to saving lives on the ground. The fallout for U.S. Israel relations because of the vote was swift. Michelle Nichols was at the U.N. in New York for the vote. Michelle, what does the U.S. shift tell us? The U.S. would tell you that there is no change to their policy, and they consider Israel's reaction to their abstention as a bit of an overreaction. So very quickly after the U.S. abstained, Netanyahu came out and he cancelled that visit, because he said the abstention was a clear retreat from the previous position of the United States, and that it would hurt Israel's war effort and their bid to try and release more than 130 hostages that are still held by Hamas. In Washington, the White House spokesperson, John Kirby, he said that the vote doesn't represent any kind of shift in policy and that nothing has changed. But in reality, if you look at how the U.S. position, I guess, has evolved on language being used at the U.N., the resolution that was passed was very strong. What does this resolution actually do for the situation in Gaza? So there has been a little bit of debate over whether this resolution is binding or non-binding. Most people would argue it's binding, but ultimately it's probably not going to change the situation on the ground. There's no sort of punishment if it's not implemented. It's not like the United States is about to let the Security Council impose sanctions on anyone if there is a safe fire in Gaza. Donald Trump has been told he has to pay less than half of what he previously owed in a civil fraud judgment against him. He also has an additional 10 days to come up with the smaller bond of $175 million. But in another New York court, it was confirmed the former president's hush money criminal trial is set to begin on April 15th. Florida is set to ban social media for users under 14 and requires those younger than 16 to get parental permission or face account termination. Governor Ron DeSantis vetoed a more strict version of the bill last month. The law takes effect July 1st. Properties owned by Sean Diddy Combs in LA and Miami have been raided by federal agents. It follows a lawsuit filed against Combs by a former girlfriend in federal court in November, accusing him of engaging in sex trafficking. Combs says he's innocent and that his accusers are seeking a quick payday. US and UK authorities are accusing China of a broad cyber espionage campaign, targeting lawmakers, academics, journalists and defense contractors. Chinese diplomats in both countries are dismissing the allegations. New Zealand has also raised concerns with China about its involvement in a state-sponsored hack on its parliament in 2021. Adam Newman is a step closer to regaining control of WeWork. He's offered more than $500 million to buy back the office sharing startup he co-founded. It's another twist in the WeWork saga. It was once valued at $47 billion, but created after it tried to go public in 2019. Newman's pursuit of expansion at the expense of profit bid to his ouster the same year, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2023. It remains to be seen how Newman is going to finance his bid or whether it will be accepted. US intelligence officials say Russia's security service has been busy, detaining opponents of President Putin and hunting down Ukrainian saboteurs, which may be white overlooked other threats, including that posed by ISIS-K. Islamic State Coruscant or ISIS-K has claimed responsibility for Friday's mass shooting, when more than 130 people were killed and almost 200 injured. So who are ISIS-K? YP Rajish is a New Delhi. They have grown in size and spread outside of Afghanistan and Pakistan into the Central Asian region. We know that they have been recruiting people from Central Asian Republics like Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and they could be using these recruits to operate beyond the borders in Russia. What impacted the US withdrawal from Afghanistan have on the group? This branch of ISIS existed before the withdrawal of the US forces from Afghanistan. However, they seem to have grown in strength after that, although the Taliban claims that they have fucked them and pushed them out of the main provinces. There has been a lot of proliferation of arms and ammunition in the aftermath of the withdrawal, which they seem to have got their hands on and have been using them. What can you tell us about their leader? The leader who heads ISIS-K right now, Sanawla Gafari, is the third chief of this group. He's supposed to be 29 years old. He is Afghan. Our reporting tried to establish his ethnicity and we found that he probably has some centralization ethnicity, which could be Tajik or Uzbek, because he's a very shadowy figure. Very little is known about him. He was in Afghanistan until sometime last year and could be based somewhere in the Badlands of Pakistan, in the province of Balochistan. But we cannot say for sure about that because the Pakistani authorities have not commented on that. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun is stepping down, as the plane maker finds itself in a full-blown crisis over safety concerns. The company's board chair and head of commercial planes business are also leaving. scrutiny has mounted after the mid-air panel blowout in January on a 737 max plane. David Shippetson covers the transportation industry. David Calhoun says leaving by the end of the year was his decision. But what does this tell us about the situation Boeing finds itself in? Boeing is really as in turmoil in the number of fronts. First with regulators, Justice Permanas investigating the MAX9. The FAA has barred the expanding production of the MAX as they demand this 90-day quality improvement program. They're not even building the 38 planes per month, but the FAA says they can build some 37s. And the airline customers are really angry about the fact that they're not getting the planes. They were promised. And as a result, we're going into a very busy anticipated potentially record-breaking summer travel season. They're not going to have the planes they anticipated. Is Calhoun's departure the first step in fixing whatever is plaguing Boeing? The fundamental question of Boeing is what is the problem with the culture that has led to serious quality problems? Right? If you listen to the FAA administrator, Mike Whitaker, who I talked to last week, and he raised one thing that I'd say seems simple, but does raise broader questions is that when he went to the Boeing factory and retin-washed it where they built the 737, they didn't do a safety briefing before it's the tour started and that's a sort of standard thing in aviation. The fact they didn't do that really caught the attention of the FAA. And that is your Tuesday. Remember to stay across developing stories throughout the day, you can head to roises.com.

Happy almost St. Patrick's Day everybody. I don't own anything green to wear, so maybe I'm lacking some of the holiday spirit apologies. The major stock indexes too, though, were not showing much enthusiasm for green. The S&P 500, for instance, closed in the red more days than not this week, but there was one day the three major indexes managed to close in the green, that was Tuesday when February's inflation rating seemed to affirm expectations for the Fed to wait until later this year to start cutting rates. And the S&P 500 notched. Its 17th record close of 2024. Let's talk about Southwest, but to talk about Southwest, we got to talk about Boeing first. As you heard on What's News this week, the plane maker has slowed down production due to increased scrutiny over its quality controls and safety issues. And this is now a big problem for airlines like Southwest. On Tuesday, the company said it's cutting its flight capacity and reevaluating its financial guidance, partially due to these delayed deliveries from Boeing. And it's not the only airline being affected by this, but Southwest also reported weaker demand for leisure travel early this year, adding more bad news to the mix. Southwest shares dropped 15% on Tuesday, making it the worst performer in the S&P 500, and the stock didn't regain much ground the rest of the week. And if we zoom out and look at the last few years, Southwest has had a bit of a rough go of it. There was of course the pandemic and then the infamous meltdown of winter 2022 with thousands of flight cancellations. And then last year around the same time it was hit with that giant $140 million penalty from said meltdown, and now this. So let's put that 15% drop into perspective. Tuesday's decline was the stock's largest percent decrease since March of 2020. So yeah, this Boeing stuff is not doing Southwest stock any favors. So we've all been fueling the relentless rise in cost of living, right? The grocery store sticker shock. So many of us who are trying to stretch our budget have probably looked to discount chains like Dollar Tree. What's News listeners, the name might ring a Bell. Dollar Tree, if you don't know, operates its namesake stores as well as the Family Dollar chain, all catering to low income shoppers. On Wednesday, Dollar Tree said it's closing about 1000 family dollar stores over the next few years as the company struggles with store theft and customers spending less thanks to all of this inflation. Now there's an important distinction I want to make here. Dollar Tree stores are mostly in suburban locations and they sell more knickknacks and such while Family Dollar stores are more concentrated in cities and they sell groceries and other essentials. So the Family Dollar stores that are closing are likely to be a vital resource in those areas, especially as more people are going to the grocery store to save money instead of eating at restaurants. McDonalds talked about this exact trend on Wednesday. And Dollar Tree's rival, Dollar General, also mentioned the impact of inflation on its shoppers. But back to Dollar Tree, its shares dropped 14% on Wednesday and they didn't regain much ground later in the week. Investors were pretty underwhelmed with Under Armour this week. It's so bad it's good, I can't help myself. On Wednesday, the sportswear company said that its founder Kevin Plank is returning as CEO. Under Armour has been struggling to find its footing in recent years. It had a really great ride of rapid growth under Plank until 2017 when its sales hit a wall and since then the company's been struggling with excess inventory, supply chain issues, et cetera. So Plank is back after leaving in 2019. How did investors react? Like I said, they were underwhelmed. Under Armour shares lost 11% on Thursday and kept moving lower Friday. And now you know What's News in Markets. And for what's to come next week, check out WSJ's Take on the Week wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Francesca Fontana, have a great weekend and see you next Saturday.\",\"Hey, listeners. It's Saturday, March 23rd. Let's get to it. Welcome back, everybody. Let's start off with a number of the day today, not to totally steal from Sesame Street, which is precisely what I'm doing. The number of the day today is three. That is how many interest rate cuts the Fed is expecting in 2024. As we heard on Wednesday, Jerome Powell and co reaffirmed their outlook of three rate cuts, so it didn't change. But some investors were expecting the Fed to dial back their forecasts, so the market got in a good rally as a result. All three of the major US stock indexes hit new records on Wednesday, and then they did it again on Thursday. Before this week, the last time they hit simultaneous records was way back in November 2021, which was before the Fed started raising rates. And because the pandemic has had an enduring effect on my ability to conceptualize linear time, that feels like four months ago and also 10 years ago. God forbid I have to write a check. I am always writing the wrong year on everything. I don't know. Is it just me? I don't think it is. Is it? All right, enough about time. Let's talk about something important: ice cream. Ben &, Jerry's, Breyer's, Talenti, Wall's, all ice cream brands, and all made by Unilever, which is this consumer goods giant that makes everything from TRESemm\\u00e9 shampoo to Dove soap to Hellman's mayonnaise. And, as you stalwart What's News listeners already heard this week, Unilever is spinning off its ice cream division into a separate company. Why? Well, they got a new CEO and he wants to streamline. Like I said, its portfolio of brands is huge. And he also wants to boost growth. And to my shock, ice cream sales have been pretty weak for Unilever lately. Like many five-year-olds might assume, I too thought that ice cream would be doing just gangbuster numbers, but I was wrong. Last year, Unilever's ice cream sales rose 2.3%, which was the weakest growth rate of any of its units. So all in all, it seemed like a welcome move in investors' eyes. Unilever's US listed shares gained almost 3% on Tuesday, which was the biggest move in either direction the stocks had in weeks, and shares went on to end the week higher. Paramount is being courted by multiple suitors, and one is after its Hollywood business. The Journal reported this week that Apollo, a private equity firm, made an $11 billion offer to buy the company's film and TV studio. That's according to people familiar with the situation. The film business is considered the crown jewel. It's the studio that recently brought us Top Gun Maverick and A Quiet Place, et cetera. The TV side, the cable networks, not so much. So Paramount's directors are reviewing this bid from Apollo and another bid from the production company, Skydance Media, which is looking to merge with all of Paramount. But what's nuts is Apollo's bid is more than the entire company's market cap, not just the Hollywood unit, the whole thing, which was 7.7 billion when we broke the news of the bid. Paramount shares ended up jumping 12% on the news, but handed back almost all of those gains by the end of the week. And to round out the week, FedEx had a surprise delivery for its shareholders on Thursday, a better than expected quarter. The company beat profit expectations despite lower demand for parcel deliveries, which I'll come back to in a second, and that earnings beat was thanks to its recent restructuring efforts. FedEx and other shipping companies have been fighting against an industry-wide slump following the pandemic-fueled surge in online shopping. We all remember that, right? I'm sure many of us contributed to it. And so now the company's also facing continued competition from its rival UPS and from Amazon, which FedEx stopped working with back in 2019. So, long story short, the company's been working to turn its performance around and cut costs with layoffs, streamlining its business, closing facilities, et cetera. And clearly it's working, and investors thought so too. FedEx shares gained 7.4% on Friday. And now you know What's News in Markets this week. And for what's to come next week, check out WSJ's Take On the Week wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Francesca Fontana. Have a great weekend.\",\" Today, a bill to force TikTok's Chinese owners out of the company passes the house. As Reuters reveals that Trump launched a covert CIA influence operation against China when he was president. Ukraine strikes Russia's refineries in the most serious attack in recent months. And chocolate lovers beware, prices are set to keep climbing. This Thursday March 14th, this is Reuters World News, bringing you everything you need to know from the front lines in 10 minutes every weekday. I'm Kim Vannell in London. And I'm Christopher Walgesburg in Chicago. This episode is brought to you by UiPath. Today, 90% of the Fortune 500 are accelerating human achievements simply, with UiPath. The world's number one AI-powered business automation platform, UiPath, the foundation of innovation. On this vote, the Yays are 352. The Nays are 65. The house votes overwhelmingly to pass a bill forcing Chinese-owned bite dance to sell TikTok or face a US ban. And now, the White House is urging the Senate to take up the bill, so the president can sign it. China's foreign ministry says there's no evidence it's misusing American's data. Lawmakers who support the bill, like Wisconsin Republican Mike Gallagher, say otherwise. TikTok is a threat to our national security because it is owned by bite dance, which does the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party. We know this because bite dance leadership says so, and because Chinese law requires it. In an election year, the legislation could be radioactive. The platform is used by about 170 million Americans. And lawmakers that complained their offices have been flooded with calls from people who oppose the legislation. TikTok content providers protesting on Capitol Hill say their livelihoods are at risk. Duke Alexander Moore founded a tax service for creators that took off on the platform. I went from literally sleeping in my truck to living in a pinhouse to now employing people. We have a team of 17 people. If TikTok were stripped away from small business owners like myself, I'm very afraid to have that different conversation that says, hey man, this isn't going to work out. Hey man, you know, your kids, I can no longer take care of them. While U.S. lawmakers attempt to ban TikTok for fear of Chinese surveillance in the U.S., New Reuters reporting reveals that in 2019, former President Donald Trump authorized a CIA campaign meant to turn the Chinese public against Beijing. Joel Shectman is in DC and has reported on how a small team of CIA operatives used fake internet identities to spread negative narratives about Xi Jinping's government, according to three former officials. Well, the backdrop in context is important here. For years, U.S. intelligence agencies and even like the Justice Department have accused China of trying to secretly influence public opinion in the United States using front groups, using student organizations, using money in Hollywood, and the idea of the Trump administration, and among some people at the CIA at the time was that the time had come to strike back. Not just in China, but in other countries that China was trying to influence that America should try to get its message into places that message might not be heard or might not be respected or listened to if it was known that it was coming from the American government. So the idea was try to influence people like inside of China to know about alleged corruption by the Chinese government or to know about how money was being allegedly wasted through the Belt and Road initiative. So the idea here was to try to use kind of fake accounts and kind of bots and avatars online in China to try to to get those messages to a Chinese audience and try to turn back the influence game against this kind of adversary. Now, it strikes me that a covert influence campaign, that's a very delicate operation. How could something like this go wrong? Yeah, I think when the United States tries its hand at trying to plant news articles or these kind of narratives, even if they're true narratives, but when they try to plant them in deceptive ways, I think the real danger is that you run the risk of kind of confirming the accusations of China, which all along has claimed that whenever there's any kind of criticism of them, that it's really kind of like a ploy by the west to kind of undermine their rising status. And China, have they responded? China is responded by saying that this kind of confirms the allegations that they've been long making that the United States is really trying to meddle in its domestic affairs while stating that they would never do such a thing here in the United States. Both the CIA and the Trump administration are both declined to comment right now. And I think for both of them, it's a very sensitive topic and they haven't been willing to go on the record and discuss it. Now, the Biden administration is often critical of Trump's tenure, but he's also left many of Trump's policies towards China in place. What do we know about the current status of this operation under President Biden? So we haven't been able to uncover that yet. It's well possible that at least the authority for the CIA to do these types of operations remains in place, but we just don't know. And the White House has declined to comment on that. You can read the whole report on Reuters.com or on our app. And Israeli Air Strike on a UN Food Distribution Center in Gaza killed four people, including a UN worker. Israel says a Hamas commander who was the target of the attack was also killed. Speaking in Washington, DC, Secretary of State to Anthony Blinken said the Israeli government had an obligation to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers. Humanitarian workers, the agencies, they need to be able to do their jobs with as much security and as much confidence as possible. A UN report has concluded that an Israeli tank strike killed Reuters reporter Isam Abdelah in Lebanon. The report says the October 13 strike broke international law. Asked about the UN report and Israeli military spokesperson said the Israeli defense forces were continuing to examine the incident. Kidnappers have demanded more than $600,000 for the release of school children in Nigeria. Gunman Kidnapped 286 pupils and staff in North Western Kaduna State last week. It's the first mass kidnapping since 2021. A planned partnership between former CNN anchor Don Lemon and social media platform X has been canned. Lemon was due to host a show on X three times a week. The announcement came just hours after Lemon conducted an interview with X owner Elon Musk, which had yet to be aired. If you are a chocolate lover, then you're probably well aware there is a global crisis in the cocoa market. But it looks like things are about to get worse. Kamal Kremens has more. Yes, three years of poor cocoa harvest of hollow dead supply and a fourth bad years forecast. Reuters is reporting that major cocoa plans in ivory coast and gana have stopped or cut processing because they can't afford to buy beans. Chocolate makers rely on processors to turn beans into butter and liqueur that can be made into chocolate. And these two countries are the biggest producers of cocoa. So this development means chocolate prices around the world are likely to keep soaring. Ukraine has struck Russian oil refineries in a wave of drone attacks that Vladimir Putin claims is an attempt to disrupt his country's presidential election. These are some of the most significant attacks since the war began. Mike Colett White is covering the story. Mike, what makes these attacks so significant? What's interesting is whether the scale is that they are clearly targeting oil infrastructure in Russian territory. Oil, as we know, is the lifeblood of the Russian economy, which is effectively funding the war in Ukraine. So Ukraine sees this is justified and they struck at least four oil refineries, including some of Russia's biggest and managed to cause extensive damage at some of them forcing units or in fact the whole refiner in one case to shut down. Is this a new focus of attack by Ukraine? It's trying to get an advantage against a much bigger enemy and it sees the best way of doing that is striking at the heart of the Russian economy. One extra point on refineries is that while Russia has plenty of oil, it does rely on Western technology to refine that oil. And so if they cause a lot of damage, the Ukrainians will be forcing the Russians to scrabble around to find spare parts basically. Are these attacks deliberately timed with Russia's elections? I think one of the big questions here is whether this is, as you suggest, timed to embarrass Putin and to undermine him or whether it's the beginning of a more sustained and large scale attack on Russian energy infrastructure. I think if it's the latter, then it's a big worry for Putin because air defense is only goes so far and bringing down drones when dozens are fired at you every day. That's it for today's episode.

Fortune tellers, hango dancers, obscure government bureaucrats, the obscure ones are the best. Totally and of course we talk to the smartest economists to explain everything from inflation and disinflation to how many teas got addicted to fossil fuel. On Bullseye, Peter Dinklage, Bird Whisperer. I started talking to the crows and befriending crows. I fed them every morning they were at my door. Birds. Vice President Kamala Harris called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Let's get a ceasefire. Let's reunite the hostages with their families and let's provide immediate relief to the people of Gaza. Harris is phrasing at a speech in Selma, Alabama repeatedly drew a pause. Many Democratic voters have objected to the Biden administration's support for Israel's offensive in Gaza. The Vice President pressed Israel to deliver more aid and pressed Hamas to accept the pause in fighting to end inhumane conditions for civilians. The U.S. has been trying for a temporary ceasefire for weeks. Good morning, Daniel. Good morning, Michelle. Could you just start by telling us what's the hold up on reaching a ceasefire? We were under the impression that this was close. Well Israel and Hamas both agree to the basics of this deal, which would be a six week ceasefire and exchange of some of the Israeli hostages in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners and getting more aid into Gaza. But we have been speaking with Israeli and Egyptian sources close to the talks. And one of the main sticking points now is that Israel wants to know how many hostages are still alive. They want to know how many Palestinian prisoners Hamas is willing to accept in exchange. Israel is not sending negotiators to these talks in Cairo until it gets answers. Now Hamas also has its own demands. It wants Palestinians to be able to return to North Gaza where fighting is mostly over. And they also want trailer homes brought into Gaza since so many homes have been destroyed in Israeli bombings. But this is just the first phase of a grand deal being negotiated. It's the foundation for every other phase needed to eventually reach the end of the war. We just heard Vice President Harris call for immediate ceasefire and you heard that it got a lot of applause. But you also said for at least six weeks, is this really a new position? I think publicly it's a more urgent plea from the United States, but all along the US has wanted to start with six weeks and then try to extend the ceasefire. And it's very tricky because Israel wants kind of the opposite. It wants to launch a final major battle in the city of Rafa in Gaza against Hamas battalions there. It's also where more than a million Palestinians are sheltering. And so behind the scenes the US has been trying and hoping that during this six week ceasefire they can avert Rafa operation and reach some other arrangement. And the US has other plans. It wants to use this six week ceasefire to set in motion grand plans like Saudi Israeli diplomatic ties and other questions about the future of Gaza. But you know polls are showing that Gantz would win if there were elections today. And it's a strong signal I think that the US is looking at the post-war future. And that future may not involve Netanyahu. Before we let you go Daniel, the US also conducted airdrops of food into Gaza over the weekend. What does that tell us? Well it tells us what we've been hearing from the United Nations. From Hungary and Gaza at least 10 children they say died from dehydration and malnutrition. The US wants to show it's doing something. Air Force cargo planes dropped food packages. But Palestinians say these airdrops are humiliating and it's not a solution. And all of this chaos about aid just shows that there's an intense pressure to reach a ceasefire deal. Daniel, thank you. You're welcome. Now to Haiti where a gang leader has orchestrated two prison breaks with the apparent goal of deposing Haiti's prime minister. At least nine people are dead including four police officers. This is a lot. Nearly every one of the more than 5,000 prison inmates escaped. They're now on the streets and the government has declared both a state of emergency and a nighttime curfew. So where is the prime minister who faces this effort to depose him? He's in Africa trying to recruit a United Nations back security force to stop the very gangs behind the violence. He is also Haiti's acting president by the way because the previous president was assassinated three years ago. For the latest on this we're going to go to Harold Isaac. Now he's an independent journalist based outside Porta Prince. Good morning. Good morning. So tell us what's happening now in the streets of Haiti's capital. Well as it is right now it's a lot of a certainty as we are under a state of emergency and under a curfew after days of violence following gang attacks. So you know look there's quite a lot of backstory to this violence. So for people who haven't been following this could you just walk us through as briefly as you can what's led Haiti to this latest moment of crisis? So the violence began on Thursday with gangs coordinating massive amount of attacks throughout the city aiming essentially at various institutions. So these coordinated attacks in Porta Prince included countries international airport, the central bank and the national soccer stadium. This is all happening while the current prime minister Ariel Henry is out of the country. Do we know how he is fairing in his efforts to bring in a UN back security force from Kenya? Well the whereabouts of Henry as it is right now at this very moment are unclear. It was supposed to be on his way back from Kenya where he went to sign an agreement with the Kenyan officials about deploying police officers from Kenya in Haiti to help deal with the gang violence. How are regular people living right now? Like how are people getting food? Can kids go to school? Well for the most part we're expecting to have a disrupted week here in Haiti as most flights have been canceled by US based carriers for the next three days. The US Embassy in Haiti has decided not to operate for these three days and the government essentially put everybody under a state of emergency and curfew. So probably everybody will stay put. And before we let you go can you tell us any more about the prison break? How did that happen? So essentially over the weekend in the early hours of Saturday coordinated attack by gangs under prison led inmates to flee and be out in the nature aggravating a secreted crisis that was already bad in the country. And before you go Harold can I ask how are you? How are you doing? Well it's a checkered reality every day. We try to sort out our commute where we go how we come back and it's going to be that again this week very likely. All right well I hope you'll you'll take care of yourself. Thank you. All right that's journalists Harold Isaac speaking to us from outside of Porter prints. Harold thank you. Welcome. As the United States has moved away from the constitutional right to an abortion France is doing the opposite. And one thing has a lot to do with the other French lawmakers are convening today in a joint session of their parliament to enshrine the right to an abortion in the Constitution which would make France the first country in the world to do so. And Pierre's Eleanor Beardsley is with us now from Paris to tell us more good morning Eleanor. Good morning guys. So set the scene for us today. What's going to happen today? And of course we want to know why now? Yeah exactly. Well it's a beautiful sunny day and there will be an extraordinary session of both houses of parliament at the palace of Versailles this afternoon. The lower house and the Senate together 925 legislators to vote on whether the Constitution should be changed. It has to pass with a three-fist majority. But this is a formality because the measure has actually been approved overwhelmingly in both houses even the more conservative Senate. The event is going to be broadcast live on French television and a giant screen is being set up to watch it at Paris's Plaza of Human Rights right across from the Eiffel Tower. The French were really shocked when Roe v. Wade was struck down. They watched abortion rights being chipped away. And at the time Macron said he wanted to make abortion rights which he called health care rights irreversible by as the French say in screaming it in the Constitution. Is access to abortion under threatened France? Absolutely not. None of the main political parties contest the right to an abortion which in France is without restriction up to 14 weeks of pregnancy and also completely covered by French health care. Though some lawmakers were against what they called messing with the Constitution. Just listen to the leader of the main opposition party to Macron in parliament. Marine Le Pen had the right-wing populist national rally party. Here she is. Is this the 50th of the UN and the United States? Is this a decision of the court supreme? You know, she asked, are we the 51st state of the United States? No. What the U.S. Supreme Court decides has nothing to do with France. Le Pen said women's rights are threatened by things like the rise of radical Islam with its inequality between the sexes and the veil for women but not by abortion rights being restricted. And she called this a political stunt by Macron. But in the end she did approve sending this measure to the joint session. Is this popular with the French public? Completely. A recent poll shows that 90% of the French support the unfettered right to an abortion. And 86% actually believe the Constitution should be the ultimate guarantor of that right. You know, abortion was legalized in France in 1974 after a huge battle led by the country's first female health minister, Simone V\\u00e9. It was a nasty fight. She was even personally insulted and verbally attacked. You know, at the time France was a very conservative, Catholic country, which does seem hard to imagine today. But so people consider this a very cherished right, a hard fought right. And you might not think that France needs this, but I spoke to women on the streets in Paris. And pretty much everyone I spoke to said, absolutely, it's the right thing to do. And I'm going to play you a 69-year-old Parisian, Gille-en-Gaultier. And she told me that it's absolutely possible that France could regress. And this right to abortion has to be protected. Here she is. So she says it's absolutely necessary. This should have been inscribed in the Constitution a long time ago. The day it was legalized. You know, Gaultier told me she actually had an illegal abortion at the time before it was legal. And she said it was horrible. But she says even today, some doctors try to dissuade women by sending them for additional exams or trying to make it, you know, trying to talk them out of it. So she says this is absolutely necessary. That is impurest, Eleanor Birchley and Paris. Eleanor, thank you. Thank you. We have a bit of news from here in the United States.

We know that race is always relevant and we have new topics, new voices and new stories for you every single week. News is a public service. Breaking news, pop culture, award-winning journalism wherever you are. Hi, I'm Jen White from 1A, the home of good conversation. But what makes it great are the ideas and insights you bring to the show every day. It seems only fair that when you make room for us, we make room for you.\",\" This is the holy month of Ramadan for Muslims around the world. It's a time of fasting, prayer, and celebration. But in Gaza with the Israeli Hamas war in its fifth month and warnings of famine growing, many residents are too hungry and sick to experience Ramadan as they wish. Israel currently prohibits international journalists from entering the territory, so reporting on Palestinians and Gaza and the hardships they're facing is an ongoing challenge. But MPR's Leyla Fadu has been finding ways to stay in touch. Today on the Sunday story, my colleague and the host of MPR's Embedded Podcast, Kelly McEvers, talks with Leyla about two stories she's been following. One is about a Palestinian-American family who was visiting Gaza when the bombardment started and got stuck in the war. The other is about a college student in Gaza who's been sending Leyla voice memos for months. My cousin just went out this morning and he saw the troops from a distance and he told us how they looked. They've shot people who were headed from the north to the south and it's really dangerous to move right now and the bombs are just getting closer and louder. Stay with us.

And you can find all of that and more in your pocket. It's all fair game for good conversation. We're back with the Sunday story. I'm handing it over now to Kelly McEvers. Hey, Leila. Hey, Kelly. So the Israeli government does not allow international journalists to report in Gaza. And for Palestinian journalists reporting there, it's incredibly dangerous. More than 85 Palestinian journalists have been killed since October 7th. But still, you've been finding ways to tell people stories from Gaza. Yeah. One of them is a young woman. Her name is Shema Ahmed. She was 20 years old when she first started sending you voice messages over WhatsApp. That was in October at the beginning of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. Hello, Leila. As you hear, the situation now may not be the best situation to record anything. You remember, but when I have service, hopefully these messages will get to you. You've been documenting her experience over the last several months. Can you just tell me a little bit more about her? Yeah. I mean, the way I found Shema was, I was trying to find people in Gaza during the very first blackout. The telecommunications company had been struck. A cell phone lines were down and all of a sudden we had lost contact with Gaza. And through a nonprofit, I was connected to Shema. And when people were able to communicate again, Shema and I started talking. I would send her texts asking her what life was like before, what like what she was going through, what she was eating, how she was surviving. And she would talk to me about life. The neighborhood I used to live in is in Shijaya. It is a place that is very close to the borders of Gaza. It is a very beautiful neighborhood. She would record voice memos into her phone whenever something came to her, whenever something was happening around her, something occurred to her. And then I would receive them in batches whenever she got a moment of service. And at the end of October, she sends me this first batch of messages. She talked a lot about her life before October 7th. The beautiful Rose Garden in her grandmother's house, the room she had just redecorated, saved up money with her sister and redecorated in their home with the help of their uncles or carpenters. She talked about her university. To put it simply, I really loved university. I loved the library. I befriended one of the librarians who was very kind to me and always gave me book recommendations and I always give them some of my book recommendations. We just had an amazing relationship. And he also helped me in a lot of things. What a beautiful nerd I thought when she was describing how much she loved her professors and she loved science and she loved the projects she was working on. She said me and the other students thought we were going to change the world with these projects. Maybe we wouldn't, but that was what we thought. And we had this goal that once we graduate, we have to at least put together a computer that we connected on our own. That was just something we had to do at some point. And what's that sound in the background? That's the drones. That's the constant soundtrack of this war, Israeli drones in the sky. So many of her voice notes came in with sounds like that. It sounds that were much worse. My cousin just went out this morning and he saw the troops from a distance and he told us how they looked. They shot people who were headed from the north to the south and it's really dangerous to move right now and the bombs are just getting closer and louder. So when I was messaging with her, she was still in the north of Gaza. When the Israeli military had told civilians to move south because Israel said anybody left in the city would be treated as a combatant. And this mass displacement had happened that the world was watching with extreme concern. People getting killed by the Israeli military on that path, people walking, carrying everything they had. But Shaymat and her family, they had nowhere to go. So they didn't make the move and the war is just escalating around her. Today, six tons of bombs, six rockets each weighed one ton were bombed on a single residential square and those bombs were US made. She knows she's talking to an American journalist. She knows she's talking to an American audience. It's really hard to see that people are aiding the violence and it's really just so hard to live through. Oh my God. That is all I have to say. I mean, I don't know if 20-year-old Shaymat knows if each of those bombs was a ton. And I don't know if she knows if those specific bombs or missiles were US made. But her point was there is a sizable amount of military aid, weapons, and support coming from the US. And she's asking why. At a time, people are questioning what many see as a disproportionate response to the attack on October 7th. And there are questions about whether war crimes are being committed with the level of civilians that are being killed. The fact that Israel isn't letting food and water and fuel and electricity into this strip, the number of children that are killed, buried, the number of people under the rubble. All of this is coming across in those first batches of messages that she's sending me. And then on October 31st or on 3pm, Shaymat goes silent. So at that point in the conflict, the Israeli military had basically ordered half the population of northern Gaza to evacuate in head south, as you said. Her families would pack like 10, 12 people into a car, navigate these bombed out roads. So did she join that big move south? I mean, I didn't know anything. I didn't know if they had made that move. Frankly, I wasn't sure she was alive at all. And then finally one morning, she resurfaced. And I got a voice memo from her. Hello, Leila. How are you? I'm pretty doing well. Thank you so much for sending all the messages to confirm that I'm still OK. And for sending me news and updates. Thank you so much. The temporary ceasefire at the end of November in which there was a hostage exchange deal and there were several days without attacks had gone into effect. And so there weren't the sound of bombs. There weren't the sound of drones. You could hear that she was getting tired. If I wanted to explain what was going on the past few weeks, it's really hard to. It's like, I feel like big parts of my life, bits of my life have been fading away. It was every day past. At this point, she's moved a little further south to Nusseidot. She was staying in a three bedroom apartment with close to 100 people in it. Every corner had people sitting, kids screaming and crying and people talking, noisy, 24, 7 of this. It's crazy. And there were only two toilets for 100 people. And that's just the worst thing for me. I hate not being able to use the toilet properly and not being able to wash myself properly and being smelly. I just hate that. And I'm clean freak. That's how I am usually. Can you imagine not just not having running water, but nowhere to clean yourself, to clean yourself up as a woman who has a period? She also, in those moments, would tell me the things that she was dreaming about. Every night as I go to sleep, my dream is just me in my room with my sister watching a TV show with a bowl full of food and chicken that we haven't eaten for the longest time ever. You know, just relaxing with my family after having had a bath and having dived in a bath with a bowl of hot, boiling water. That is just a dream that I really wish could come true. There's so much that's in there, right? The unsaid there. The food that can't come in. So she's not eating. The hot bath, the hot shower, all things you can't have in this moment. So you were getting these messages from Shema during the temporary ceasefire, which lasted about a week and then ended on December 1st. And we know that Nusadot, the area where she was, was hit pretty hard after that. Were you able to get in touch with her? So at this point, as soon as I heard hostilities had resumed that the bombardment, the Israeli bombardment had started again, I messaged her saying, are you okay? Are there any attacks in your neighborhood? Are there any fighting? And she sent me a long message that started with, yes, it's true. It is continuous. It seems like we might have to evacuate again. But I don't think we're moving this time because we've had enough. Seriously, we've had enough. It's that we have no place to go. It's packed everywhere. We're either going to die being shot or hungry. So it's better to die where we are. And then I didn't hear from her again. And I kept thinking, okay, when is she going to get in touch? How do I get in touch with her? What's happened? And then finally, at the beginning of February, a new batch of voicemembers. We're about to move. I'm by the window just to record this. My parents are running around. My uncles and aunts are running around. They're from the weeks that she wasn't in touch with me. She was recording for the day that she got cell data and was able to send them. And remember, she's not a journalist. She's documenting what she's going through for the world as she's going through it. The first one describes a day in early January where she's being displaced again. It's already been 90 days before. It's not something easy. It's not something easy to handle. I have no idea if this is ever going to get to you because the place we're about to move to is a place we're about to move to this time would be a complete isolation. She was on her way to the camps in De De Belay, which is a refugee camp in central Gaza. And remember, really much of Gaza are refugee camps from 1948 when Israel was created and when Palestinians describe what they call the Nakba, the catastrophe, their mass displacement, hundreds of thousands of people forcibly, sometimes violently displaced. And De De Belay was a place that became a refugee camp in 1948 that started with tents, became hardened apartment buildings, and now is back to tents. So the historical echoes are everywhere in everything she says that day. Right now we're walking out of this one to our court. We're basically running away. And just as a note, this is the seven-place square evacuating tube. Were the eights? I seriously lost count. This is the seventh place we're evacuating to. She's saying, or the eights. She doesn't even know. She doesn't even know that's how many times. That's how many times. And around her, everybody's walking to. And as I'm walking, nobody's laughing. Everybody has a grim face on after they've been kicked out of their houses, kicked out of everywhere. They could evacuate to, end it up on the streets in camps. And everybody this is over and keep going and goza. Get their payback from what they experienced and what they've lost. Nothing. Nothing can ever pay back what we've seen. The horrors we've been through. Wow, her voice sounds so different from those first voice memos she sent you. Yeah, I mean, it's changed. It's hardened, Kelly. That's when I get afraid because when people are in so much pain going through so much trauma, they do want revenge. I remember that after October 7th, I was talking to a young man from the Kabut's Barry who told me, I don't care what happens to the people of Gaza, shoot them all. And it wasn't because he's a bad person. He was a traumatized, angry, scared person who was hurt because about 100 people in his community were killed. And now listening to Shay Met and she's talking about payback and that's the cycle. You know, you're hearing it happen because people are human. Yeah. And you know, I've met people who say, I know that I've been hurt, but they're opposed to this level of the Israeli government retaliation. For example, I met a person whose brother was killed in the October 7th attack who said, I know my brother's killed, but this bombardment won't make me safer. If you go kill Palestinians, civilians, it won't make me safer. We have to solve it in a different way. But that is not the common reaction of a person who's been through something like this. What about Shay Met? How is she doing? Is she okay? Physically, she's okay. You know, she hasn't been hurt so far. She's lost her grandmother, her two uncles, professors, friends. She knows her university has gone. Her neighborhood on the border with southern Israel, Shajaya is gone. Her house is gone. She's in this refugee camp and she's living a life that you shouldn't be living in 2024. No gas. People are cooking over an open fire. They're constantly looking for food, for water. And a reminder here, this is a man-made humanitarian disaster. You know, we're just a few months in and people are on the brink of famine. The UN just put out a report saying 10 children in Gaza have died from starvation or dehydration. Shay Met said the camp is really crowded. It's cold. People are sleeping in poorly insulated tents. And she and everyone there are digging out their own toilets in the ground. And I think the hardest message was when she sent me a message asking me, like, do you know about people who would sponsor students from Gaza? Because I need to go somewhere else. It's pretty hard to see a future here. Especially not being able to get access to education. I'm so passionate about learning. It's just what defines me in some ways. Recently, she said she's even abandoned that. They're just finding a way to get out of Gaza. And that could cost a lot of money to try to get on that list to cross into Egypt. Although if Gaza was the same as it used to be, I would never... all the people I love are here, I'm a friends are here. But at the same time, it's the only choice I have, basically. She's realizing there's no future for her in this place that she described with such love in those early days. And probably would still describe with love, but she knows there's nothing to go back to. After the break, Leyla will talk about how this conflict is affecting one Palestinian family who lives here in the US. At the Plano Money Podcast, we talk to anyone who can help us understand the economy. Fortune tellers, tango dancers, obscure government bureaucrats, the obscure ones are the best. Totally. And of course we talk to the smartest economists to explain everything from inflation and disinflation to how manatees got addicted to fossil fuel. On the Coatswitch Podcast, conversations about race and identity don't begin or end with the news cycle. That's because we know race and identity impact every person and influence every story. Know that fizzy feeling you get when you read something really good, watch the movie everyone's been talking about or catch the show, the internet can't get over. At the Pop Culture Happy Hour podcast, we chase that feeling five times a week. We talk about the busiest movies, TV, music, books, and more. During this conflict, Lele, you've also been reporting on Palestinians who live outside of Gaza. You spent time staying in touch with a couple, Wafa, Abu Zayda, and Abu Oqal. They have a two-year-old son. They live in Massachusetts. But they were actually visiting Gaza when the bombardment started. How did you meet them? Yeah, at first, we were doing a lot of stories about Israeli-Americans and other dual nationals who were feeling unsafe in Israel. They wanted to get home. There were all these efforts to help people get out of Israel. I started to wonder about what about dual nationals in Gaza? What about Americans in Gaza? What is being done to help them? That's how I ended up getting in touch with Wafa. And they hadn't been to Gaza where their family lives in years. And they had wanted the family to meet you, if they're babies. So, with that, and Abu Dut took a quick vacation, well, they thought it was going to be a quick vacation. And then they find themselves with their child in Gaza when the war breaks out. You know what's the hardest feeling? The hardest feeling ever is to hide your fear and show the opposite just to keep my son positive and full of energy because he doesn't understand anything. He thinks this is a fireworks. Okay, mommy, clap, clap. This is a fireworks. But sometimes he will jump, he will be scared, then freaking out if I'm not next to him. This is the first time I ever spoke to Wafa. And this was after them four days and days trying to get help calling the US Embassy in Jerusalem, calling the US Embassy in Cairo being told, really nothing, getting no information. There was no way to get out. The borders are sealed to remember. Nothing is coming in or out, not just people, but anything else, not fuel, not food, nothing. And so, they start going public. They start talking to the press because they don't know what else to do. Not nobody's helping. Everybody's talking to us, but nobody's helping. I think of this all the time. I think about it all the time, about her on our airwaves talking to millions of Americans. Please, please, save us. What happened next? How did they get out? Yeah, so for 29 days they were trapped in Gaza. And then one day, Habbud said to me that their names showed up on the list of people that are approved by Israel and Egypt to leave via the Rafaq crossing, the border between the south of Gaza and of Egypt. And they got out. They got out. They went to Egypt and finally got back to Massachusetts. And then I got to talk to them again at home with Yusuf Safe. Is this Yusuf? This is Yusuf Yusuf? Hi Yusuf. Yusuf. Hi. So I asked her how he was doing because I know he's too little to understand, but I always am curious about how little kids like that internalize such trauma. Does he know he's safe? I don't know if he knows that or not, but I think he knows we're back home because he started to go around all his favorite places at the house and his room. And I think he knows we're back. And what about Wafaq and Habbud? How are they doing? I mean, even the decision to leave was very hard for them because they left their parents at that point behind and other extended families siblings. And so they had a lot of survivor skills like why am I okay? How come I got to cross the gate? I think we were supposed to be extremely happy when we crossed into Egypt. Yet I think Wafaq and I for the first two hours of that drive were just in tears because you look back and you think about the people you left behind. Even even those family members that you were not close with or you didn't know, you became extremely close with because you were facing moments where you thought you all were going to die together. So I think when Wafaq and I got to Cairo, we both had the same feeling. We took showers back to back and we both cried in the shower because we haven't taken a shower for weeks and we know our parents still can't take a shower. What does he know about his family now? How are they? Are they okay? At this point when I spoke to Wafaq and Wafaq was checking on her family constantly. They had gotten out of Gaza just after her and so she knew that they were safe. Our Boots parents were refusing to leave because the siblings were still there and their grandkids but they did just get out. Our Boots said though he can't always get in touch with his family that's still there. His siblings because of the comms blackouts and he says in some ways being on the outside, it's harder because you're not there to know that they're safe and so you're just guessing like the rest of the world. We hear of bombings in an ex-naverhood and you try to reach out to the people that you live in that neighborhood and the calls won't go through and then there's no way for you to confirm. So he's not even sure how many family members they've lost. How many American citizens are still in Gaza? Do we know? It's really unclear at this point. When I was speaking to Wafaq and Abu Dhe at the beginning of all this, there were hundreds. We know that there are still Americans in Gaza and there were a lot of people. Wafaq and Abu Dhe included the felt that the American administration did not take the same type of care for American citizens in Gaza that they did for citizens in other places. And the question was raised, do American lives have less value in one place than they do in another? Publicly, the administration says no, we work hard to get American citizens out no matter what. But a couple families sued the Biden administration over all of this. They said the government just didn't do what it was supposed to do. They didn't try hard enough to get US citizens and relatives of US citizens stuck in Gaza at a danger. What about Wafaq? How has this experience affected her or how does she talk about it? I mean, when I spoke to them, I felt like they were still shell shocked. I feel right now. I don't want to leave the house. I feel like I want to stay here. I feel safe here. I think they were still struggling to express what they've been through. A lot of people were asking, would you like to go back to Gaza or Palestine? For now, I don't have an answer, but I don't know if I'm going to go back with USIF again to Gaza. Because every moment, I imagined USIF under one of the houses or in the hospital or or dying or I don't know. I think with USIF, it's hard to do it again. You know, as something I was thinking about is they would sleep all on top of each other in Gaza so that if something happened, they would die all three. As Wafaq put it, not one, not two, all three. Listening to their story, I just can't help but think about how Palestinians from Gaza will never really be able to go back to the place they knew. I mean, what do you think will be their relationship to this place in the future? Yeah, I mean, I think about USIF, right? USIF had never been to his parents' homeland before and the first time he goes, it was war. And it's not even the original ancestral home because Wafaq and Abou'd's parents and grandparents were displaced from where they really are from. And Abou'd and Wafaq grew up with multiple incidents of either violence or war or encounters with Israeli soldiers. Gaza had several conflicts that were considered extremely deadly before what we're seeing now. And so I thought about the generations and generations of pain, you know, decade after decade of living under occupation and the dehumanizing thing that it does to everybody involved because the security of everyone in this strip of land is intrinsically linked. And if you live through something like what we're seeing right now, we're according to the Gaza Health Ministry more than 12,000 children have been killed. So they don't have a future. What is the future for the civilians, the young people, the children who do survive? I mean, this makes me think about Seyma. When's the last time you heard from her? About a week ago, she posted a video to her Instagram from the refugee camp she's living in, so I knew she was still alive. And she sent me messages since at this point, she doesn't know if she'll be able to get out of Gaza. And if she stays, she's not sure what her future will look like. You can hear her wondering about that in lots of the voice memos. She sent me over the last five months. You know, we're craving everything. We miss our life so bad. We miss our home so bad. We miss Gaza that we knew so bad. Because now everything we know is gone. And when we see the pictures and we see our memories and all the nice times we spent together, it feels like these times didn't exist in the first place. And even after this is over, we're going to go back to destruction, total and complete destruction because it's just full of rubble, un-rebel in that is all. Does that mean permanent displacement for people like Seyma? That's what they're asking. That's what they're wondering. Is there a possible peaceful solution with these decades and decades of pain and trauma and cycles of violence? All those questions are in my head right now about the children of Gaza, about the children of Israelis, about the children of Palestinians. Well, thank you so much. Thank you.

The UN says gang rape likely occurred during Hamas' attack on Israel. It's Tuesday, March 5th. This is Reuters World News, bringing you everything you need to know from the front lines in 10 minutes every weekday. I'm Christopher Walgespur in Chicago. And I'm Carmel Kremens in Dublin. The UN says it is likely that rape and gang rape did occur during the Hamas raids on Israel. A team looking into the October 7th attacks were led by special envoy for sexual violence and conflict, Pramella Patton. And in most of these incidents, big teams were first subjected to rape and then killed. Hamas has repeatedly rejected the accusations. The report also found evidence that some hostages taken to Gaza have been subjected to sexual violence. The UN also received information about sexual violence against Palestinians being held by Israel. Israel said no complaints had been received. Hours before the UN report was released, Israeli forces raided the Palestinian administrative capital of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Palestinian sources say it was the biggest raid in years on Ramallah. Several armored vehicles and dozens of soldiers could be seen carrying out what Israel says was a counterterrorism operation. The US Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump can't be removed from state ballots under the 14th Amendment. The justice is unanimously overturning a Colorado top state court's ruling that Trump should be disqualified for his role in the January 6th Capitol attack. It's a major victory for Trump who was facing similar moves in other states. The former president won the North Dakota Republican presidential caucus on Monday. Meanwhile, the estate of late Irish singer, Shenato Conner, is asking the former president to stop using her music. Trump played the hit Nothing compares to you at a campaign event in Maryland last month. China is hardening its stance on Taiwan. It dropped a reference to peaceful reunification in a report delivered by Premier Li Chang at the opening of Parliament. And in the South China Sea, the Philippines is accusing China's Coast Guard of carrying out dangerous maneuvers that resulted in a collision between its Coast Guard and a Chinese vessel. China's Coast Guard said the Philippine vessels illegally intruded. Spotify is cheering a ruling that hits Apple with a $2 billion fine for thwarting competition in Europe. Brussels hit the iPhone maker with the fine for thwarting competition via restrictions in its App Store. Apple says it will appeal the ruling and points out that the primary advocate and biggest beneficiary from the decision is Spotify, a company based in Europe. China has set itself an ambitious growth target of about 5% this year, despite some major challenges. And the country is proving to be a hard sell for some big US consumer brands. Apple's iPhone sales in China fell by nearly 25% in the first six weeks of this year. The overall smartphone market in China is shrinking and Apple is facing stiff competition from domestic rivals. It's now ranked fourth in that market compared to the number two spot a year ago. Tesla's China sales, meanwhile fell in February, dimming its outlook for global deliveries and sending its shares getting over 7% on Monday. It's Super Tuesday and primaries across the country are expected to reinforce Biden and Trump's candidacies for the presidential race. Down ballot, though, it's a tighter race for some Democrats and Republicans fighting for the nomination of their party in November. I spoke to McKinney Bryce who covers Congress in Washington DC about what to watch for. McKinney, let's start with the Alabama second district. So Alabama had to redraw its congressional maps. And the upshot of that is that the second congressional district is considered open. It had had a Republican incumbent and now about 18 or so Democrats and Republicans are buying for the seat. And it is considered to be a seat that Democrats can win. And so that can add to their total. In California, there's a couple of high profile seats open. Kevin McCarthy's House seat and then Diane Feinstein's seat. How are the candidates vying for either of those spots? So California allows the top two vote getters to advance to the general election. And that can be regardless of party, which means that we could see two Republican or two Democrats. In the case of Kevin McCarthy's old seat, which is the 20th district. One of the challengers is Vince Fonk who used to be an aide to McCarthy. And he has drawn an endorsement from McCarthy and from Trump. But there are a number of other candidates who are seeking the seat as well on the Senate side in California. There are four main candidates who have drawn the most attention. On the Democratic side, there's Adam Schiff who was chair of the House Intelligence Committee. And also led the first impeachment former president Donald Trump. There's also Katie Porter who represents a seat in Orange County and is considered an economic progressive. There's also Barbara Lee who is a prominent anti war voice and who is particularly well known for being the only lawmaker to vote against the authorization of the military. He supports after 9-11 and on the Republican side, there is Steve Garvey who is a former baseball player. And he has seen quite a bit of momentum going into the race. Now, our colleague Stephanie Kelly recently reported about some of the money influencing these down ballot races. How is that playing out in some of the elections that you mentioned? So we have seen crypto enthusiasts get heavily involved. This is an industry that Congress has been looking to regulate. And so they poured quite a bunch of money into super PACs and they backed a candidate in Alabama. And they also spent heavily against Katie Porter who is running for Senate in California. She has question power usage by crypto miners. And so they they have opposed her as she's seeking to be one of the top two candidates in the California Senate elections. To get the latest on Super Tuesday, check out our live page on Reuters.com and on our app. A state of emergency has been declared in Haiti as criminal gangs try to oust the prime minister. The US and Canada have told all citizens to leave the country immediately after armed men broke out thousands of prisoners from the country's biggest jails. Harold Isaac is in Port-Aprints. Harold, Haiti's been plagued by violence. What has sparked this recent curfew? Well, the country has been in kind of a chronic security crisis for the last few years. But we're in this special kind of heightened level of gang violence following an official trip of the prime minister, R.L. Henry, to Kenya, where he went to inked an agreement with Kenya authorities to have the deployment of police officers in Haiti to help deal with the gang violence. The police officer, the police officer, is also known as barbecued former police officer turned notorious gang leader, essentially considered that trip as a provocation and claims that it helped him unite all the rival gangs to try and topple the government of the interim prime minister, R.L. Henry. And then he used that force to target the country's prisons. So essentially over the weekend following a sophisticated and combined attack from several gangs, they managed to break into at least two major detention facilities where they freed over 4,000 people. And that figure is just for one center. We don't know how many inmates were freed in the second major detention center in the country, which was on the other side of town. So that created a new dynamic in the security crisis that was already very serious. What is the latest on the potential for help from outside of Haiti to to bring things back under control? Well, as of the moment, it is unclear to whereabouts of the prime minister who was supposed to be on his way back from Kenya from that trip. And it's unclear when you'll be able to get back in everybody's waiting for that. But essentially the gangs are defiant in telling him that he won't be able to be coming back to the country. And finally, fast wheels on the Formula One track, but the wheels of justice move a lot slower. A special edition Ferrari stolen almost 30 years ago in Italy has turned up in Britain. The Ferrari testarossa belongs to Austrian Formula One driver Gerhard Berger. He saw the heft unfold during the 1995 San Marino Grand Prix and even tried in vain to give chase in a friend's Volkswagen Golf. Police in Britain have finally tracked the vehicle down after Ferrari reported it was being sold through a British broker to a US buyer. It's worth nearly half a million dollars. Another Ferrari stolen the same weekend remains missing. That's it for Tuesday. We'll be back tomorrow with our daily headline show.

Investors aren't holding their breath for bazooka-style stimulus as China's parliament gathers for its annual meeting. It's Monday, March 4th. This is RoiT his world news, bringing you everything you need to know from the front lines in 10 minutes, every weekday. I'm Kim Vannell and London. And I'm Carmel Kremens in Dublin. This episode is brought to you by UI Path. Today, 90% of the Fortune 500 are accelerating human achievements simply, with UI Path. The world's number one AI-powered business automation platform, UI Path, the foundation of innovation. And given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire. Or at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table. Vice President Kamala Harris is showing the most forceful demand yet from the White House over the war in Gaza. He meets with Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz in DC today. The meeting comes after a weekend of destruction and desperation. Strikes on the offer, the last refuge of people fleeing for safety killed dozens. Including Rania Abel-Ansa's twin babies, their tiny bodies now wrapped in white shrouds, pajamas visible underneath. Survivors are left starving. On Saturday, screams rang out as civilians battled to reach ready meals, air dropped by the US. James McKenzie is Reuters' bureau chief for Israel and the Palestinian territories. James, what should we make of Kamala Harris' comments? I think what they show is the frustration that's building up in Washington and the sort of horror that's growing in different places around the world at the extent of this crisis that's building up in Gaza. Kamala Harris is blaming Hamas for not agreeing to the terms of a ceasefire. Earlier reports suggested it was the Israelis not coming to the table. Where are the negotiations at? The fact is they haven't reached a point where both sides need to agree to deal. I'm not sure that we know enough about what exactly is going on in these talks to be able to sort of conclusively pin the blame on one side or another side. The US air dropped some 38,000 ready meals into Gaza over the weekend. What does that tell us? It was very telling. These kind of air drops are usually done in the last resort. It's kind of seeing some of the other times the US military's dropped MREs were in North and Iraq in the 90s after the first Gulf War or in Afghanistan in 2001. The fact that just across the border there's columns of aid trucks waiting to go into Gaza while they're forced to do these air drops is just a mark of how blocked the whole political and administrative situation around getting this aid has become. France is set to become the first country in the world to enshrine the right to abortion in its constitution. Lawmakers are expected to vote in favor of the move in a special session of parliament today at the Palace of Versailles. Richard Locke is in Paris. Richard, why is President Emmanuel Macron doing this now? The catalyst in fact came from across the Atlantic Ocean after the US Supreme Court's decision in 2022 to overturn the landmark row versus Wade ruling. Following that here in France, numerous draft bills were proposed to cement abortion rights in this country's founding document. So that this freedom would not be repealed by some French future French government. This is a move that opinion polls suggest is supported by 86% of the country. Those of poll after that US move in which nearly nine and ten respondents said they would support such an act. Again, quite surprising when you think that this is a predominantly Catholic country. The Supreme Court has signaled it will issue rulings on Monday, one of which could be a decision on whether Colorado can kick former President Donald Trump off the primary ballot. Colorado is one of 15 states holding primary elections on Super Tuesday and Trump is currently on the ballot there. Nikki Haley, meanwhile, has won her first victory of the 2024 campaign. She beat Donald Trump in Washington, DC, a small, symbolic success in her bid to become the Republican presidential nominee. Pakistan's new prime minister Shabad Sharif promising reforms.

Thousands of delegates from all over China are descending on Beijing for Tuesday's opening session of parliament. The meeting will be scrutinized for clues on how President Xi Jinping plans to deal with China's economic problems. Marius Saharia is in Hong Kong and will be watching the speeches. What investors have been calling for more than a year is a clear roadmap for resolving the property crisis as well as for bold policy moves that solve some of China's structural issues. Premier Li Chong, Xi's number two will outline China's policy priorities for the year. What can we expect? Analysts do expect policymakers to deploy moderate amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus this year, but they also expect them to avoid the kind of splurge on investment and construction that we've seen, for instance, after the global financial crisis because their policy ammunition is limited by major amounts of debt accumulated in the local government sector. We heard today that Li isn't going to hold a press conference. Has that exacerbated concerns about a lack of transparency around policymaking? This breaks with the tradition maintained for three decades. These press conferences gave the media a rare opportunity to ask questions about government policy. Some analysts raised concerns about transparency and access to information, but authorities say there would be more briefings this year where senior officials can discuss various issues of length. So it remains to be seen how open policy makers will be in the end about discussing the economic difficulties that they're facing. Hunting and now climate change is a threat to the 300 or so left in Scandinavia. Lisi Nisner has visited special breeding grounds where the animals are raised before being released into the wild. The region they live is a mountainous region where it's very cold and temperatures can easily drop to minus 25, 30 degrees during winter. So there's a lot of snow and with a lot of snow I mean meters of snow, harsh winds. So it's not easy to spot them. So in these 18 closest, the eight couples live mainly inside their dens on the ground. I would describe it as a mixture of a dog, a cat and a fox and it's very rewarding to monitor them because they have this typical chump which is very nice to see. They shout between the enclosures to keep them or make them each other aware of threat or something happening. There's a roundings warm and as rodents and food supply are less than it was before. If we get warmer and more unstable climate where you get snow melt and you get icing on the ground that is going to affect how well the rodents can survive. I went back in July 2023 to see the puppies growing up and that was very very cute so I want this is a pet now. And finally went on a trip 500 kilometers by car south of Uptal to a national park where they have been released into freedom. This episode is brought to you by progressive insurance.

The Princess of Wales apologizes for confusion caused by a Mother's Day photo. In Georgia, enthusiasm wanes among black voters who carried Biden to victory in 2020. And in Ireland, a vote to act sexism from the Constitution is defeated. It's Monday, March 11th. This is Reuters World News, bringing you everything you need to know from the frontlines in 10 minutes, every weekday. I'm Carmel Krimmins in Dublin. Palestinians throw fireworks in a camp for displaced people in Gaza. A rare moment of light relief as they prepare for the holy month of Ramadan. The specter of war and hunger hangs over the enclave. This woman, Umsohab Abu Jabal, says her table is normally full of different types of food to break the fast. This year, she does know her family will find Annie. And a much hoped for ceasefire is nowhere in sight. James McKenzie is bureau chief for Israel and the Palestinian territories. James, why have the ceasefire talks stalled? Essentially, the two sides are still far apart on the issue of what should happen with the war in Gaza. A Hamas is insisting that for the hostages to be released, the war has to be ceasefire, but a definitive ceasefire. So Israel withdraws from Gaza and we're essentially in the post-war era. And Israel says that's not possible. It says it's delusional. It insists that it's going on until final victory until Hamas is defeated, dismantled, destroyed, and all the hostages are brought back. What are the security concerns for Israel heading into Ramadan? You know, we just have to think back to last year when there were clashes around Al-Aksa Mos in Jerusalem that led to a very tense period when Hamas fired rockets. It's just a very charged and volatile time and place because Al-Aksa Mosques are tremendously sensitive and it's a kind of sort of flashpoints with the war going on in Gaza and the Ramadan coming up though. The months and in fact years now of really very high levels of violence in the West Bank just made it a particularly sensitive and potentially dangerous time. A photograph of the Princess of Wales with her three children released by Kensington Palace on Mother's Day was meant to showcase her recovery from surgery. Instead, it triggered even more speculation after three news agencies, including Reuters, who drew the edited photo for failing to meet their editorial standards. The Princess later apologized for any confusion caused, posting on ex that, like many amateur photographers, she does occasionally experiment with editing. Kate Hilton is Reuters' bureau chief in London. So there were lots of questions on social media about whether the picture had been photoshopped and then the so-for largest international news agencies, which includes Reuters, Associated Press, AFP and Getty, all around at the same time and late afternoon, issued was known as a kill order, which tells their clients, we've withdrawn this picture, please do not continue to use it. The thing you have to know here is that news agencies do not want to issue photos that have been overly edited because it could cast out about the integrity of the photographs. And there were certain issues with the photographs, certain areas appear to be blurred to do with the cardigan of Kate's daughter didn't appear quite in line as you would expect it to be. And what is the upshot of all of this being this fororae over the photo? It's become a very large story. So if the photograph was issued and attempted to dampen down the speculation, it's actually a happy opposite effect. There is a large amount of humour online as to what has gone on with the photographs, but it means that it's pushed it to the top of the news agenda, which I imagine is not what the palace were hoping for. Atomic Bomb Drama, often hymer stole the show with this year's Oscars, clinching best picture, best director and best actor. Emma stolen one of the best actress award for poor things, but Barbie went home empty handed, except for the best song award and a scene stealing turn from Ryan Gosling, who performed I'm just Ken with three dozen backup Ken's fireworks and a surprise appearance by guns and rose guitarist Slash. This time they made this virtual. A harsh rebuke from Vladimir Zelensky. The Ukrainian president rejecting a call from Pope Francis to negotiate an end to the war with Russia and, quote, have the courage to raise the white flag. Ukraine says it will never capitulate. Victory for Portugal's centre-right democratic alliance in Sunday's election. But it's unclear if they can govern without the support of the far-right Shaga party. Shaga quadrupled its seats in Parliament as Portugal joins Europe's shift to the right. And in Haiti, the US military has airlifted non-essential embassy staff and added US forces to bolster security. The country is under a state of emergency as gang violence threatens to topple the government. President Biden is going to lay out his fiscal wishlist later today, and it's as much an election year pitch as anything else. He's expected a call for an increase in corporate taxes, a cut in tax deductions for executive pay and jets, and for the government to be able to negotiate lower drug prices. But it's going to be difficult to get any proposal past Congress, and Biden's plans for defense spending are going to be modest after last year's debt limit deal. He's going to request a 1% increase in defense spending, meaning fewer new ships and jets. Voters in Ireland have rejected proposed changes to the country's constitution that would have removed a reference to her mother's duties in the home and broadened the definition of family beyond marriage. Porik Halpin covered the referendum in Dublin. Porik, this was characterized by the government as a chance to remove sexist, old fashioned language from the constitution. What happened? I think what was most eye-opening was the margin of defeat as well, with 74% voting against the proposal. What was interesting was that when posters asked a selection of voters why they voted no in such gay numbers, the answer suggested that, by and large, it wasn't removing references on the importance of a woman's life within the home from the constitution that they had a problem with. It was a replacement wording. Now, the government proposed replacing those pauses, which language recognising care within families. And that really cut through in the campaign, because the exit poll found that a significant number of responses thought that those changes would diminish the government's responsibility when it came to supporting care, that it would be seen as more of a private endeavor than the funding that the state would support. I think that proved really critical in the days when people made their mind off. What happens now? So, this language stays in the constitution that the government has said it won't attempt to change that wording in the remaining days of its time in office. Shunvain, which is the main opposition party, Dave said that they would like to run another referendum. But I think the scale of the defeat on Saturday will make all future governments tread a lot more carefully when it comes to referendums to a men's constitution. In 2020, black voters flipped Georgia blue, which was a crucial and historic get for then-candidate Joe Biden. But as Georgia heads to the polls in Tuesday's primary, the question is, are these voters still with Joe or might they sit this one out? Kat Stafford is our race and justice editor. Kat, the last time we had these massive voter drives backed by Stacey Abrams and other black organizers, what are we seeing right now in the ground in Georgia? Right now, what we're seeing in Georgia is still this concerted effort to try and figure out how to galvanize black voters. So we're seeing a lot of organizations trying to figure out how they can tap back into that 2020 blueprint where you saw really this multi-racial, multi-generational group of folks really show out in support of Biden. But we are hearing concerns right now that they're not quite sure who voters are going to vote for or even if they return out. So I think we're seeing advocates try and shore up support and really try and see just what are the issues that are resonating with voters and how can they take that back to the Biden campaign in particular and say, hey, you really need to get out and address these concerns on the ground. What are those concerns? We're hearing directly from black voters themselves as well as a lot of the advocates who are doing that ground work that black voters are particularly concerned about the surge in the cost of living. They are concerned about these racial justice priorities that they feel like were the focal point of 2020, but they've kind of fallen by the wayside according to them. They want to see more action on voting rights. They want to see white supremacy and the threat of white nationalism being addressed by Biden and his administration. And the Biden administration in response to that has said, hey, this is something that we've been focused on for the president's first turn. We have scored a lot of wins specifically for black Americans such as cutting childhood poverty in half in 2021, as well as a lot of support that they've given to small black businesses. So they're saying that we have these successes, but where the disconnect is, people aren't aware that some of these things have happened. And so a lot of the advocates, civil rights leaders that we've spoken with have told us that they have messaged directly to Biden's campaign that there is a bit of a messaging disconnect and that is something that they need to focus on in the year ahead.\",\" President Biden said what he wanted in Gaza. We're going into Ramadan. It should be nothing happening. Instead the war continues into the Muslim holy month. A temporary ceasefire could point to a longer piece, so why is it so hard to achieve? Haysian gangs have coordinated attacks on his government, so could one of their leaders become Hades next president. And in a moment of global conflict, a movie about the creation of the atomic bomb sweeps the Academy Awards. For better or for worse, we're all living in Oppenheimer's World, so I would really like to dedicate this to the peacemakers everywhere. Other Oscar winners referred to conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.

So every week we share a candid, unscripted conversation between two people around the themes of love, loss, family, and friendship. These aren't experts or celebrities, just everyday people like you and me. Muslims are marking the start of the Holy Month of Ramadan today. And there is is yet no ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The US with Arab mediators has been trying for weeks to pause the war during this Holy Month of Daily fasting introspection and worship. Here's what President Biden told MSNBC over the weekend. I want to see a ceasefire. And I'm starting with a major, major exchange of prisoners for a six week period. We're going into Ramadan. It should be nothing happening. And we should build off that ceasefire. Should be nothing happening, he says. Hey there, Aya. Hi, good morning, Steve. Why isn't there a deal? So the main issue is over what kind of ceasefire this is going to be. The US, as you heard by Densei, backs six weeks, a humanitarian truce in which 40 to 50 Israeli hostages are released and much more aid flows into Gaza. And the US hopes that they can build on this during the talks and make it extend. But Hamas wants an end to the war. Or at least US guarantees that any truce will be extended. And they're using hostages as leverage. Now Israel agrees with the six week pause in the fighting. But Israel's military and political leadership, they're insisting on a military operation in southern Gaza to dismantle Hamas battalions in Rafa. That is where more than a million Palestinians have been displaced, many are living in tents, and they have nowhere left to go. You know, I watched a good part of this interview the president had with Jonathan K. Part of MSNBC. And it's a really revealing exchange. The US has said, don't invade Rafa where all of these civilians are taking shelter along with Hamas. Jonathan K. Part says, is that a red line? Meaning you'll really respond if Israel invades Rafa. Biden says, yes, it's a red line. But then added there are no red lines when it came to US support for Israel's defense. Meaning he doesn't really want to hammer Israel. If they do this, how does Israel respond then? He spoke to political after Biden's remarks. And he said Israel will go to Rafa because his red line, he says, is October 7th, making sure that this Hamas attack that killed 1200 people in Israel never happens again. And he also bluntly repeated his opposition to Biden's support for a two-state solution, saying his positions have the backing of the majority of Israelis who he says, quote, don't want to see a Palestinian state. Netanyahu argues that a Palestinian state would be a security threat for Israel. Is there any indication that the Israeli leader has changed course at all in response to requests from the United States? Well, there's things he hasn't done, for example. Like he hasn't gotten in the way of Biden's efforts to have the US drop food from planes, to people starving in northern Gaza. And Israel says it is working closely on a sea route that the US and other countries want to use to send aid that way into northern Gaza. But what he also hasn't done is what aid groups say would be the most efficient, most direct, quickest way to get food in, which is open border crossings with the north of Gaza. Now land crossings is what the aid groups want. So what are conditions like in Gaza right now? People are absolutely exhausted, Steve. And people also just need clean running water, electricity, and food. And the usual traditions of Ramadan are impossible in these conditions. Have a listen to what Sena Manajar says. He's a 62 year old man who's fled his home in Gaza. He says it's not right that people are living in tents and can't visit with family or perform nightly prayers in mosques because of bombings. But he also says it's not fair that some Hamas leaders are living comfortably in exile while the people of Gaza are eating excrement, though he used a different word for that. Mm. Really appreciate it. Thank you, Steve. Um, armed gangs control much of Haiti's capital as part of a revolt. Yeah, many groups in the country have been working to remove the country's prime minister and they conveniently struck when he was out of the country. He's still not able to return. Ariel Henrias, so unpopular, he wasn't even allowed into the neighboring Dominican Republic, the other country on that island. Hey, good morning, Steve. How'd the prime minister get into such a jam? This standoff begins about two weeks ago. And that's when these gangs who used to fight each other started working together to overthrow the government. They started attacking government targets, police stations, the port, the airport. And they've been trading heavy fire with police so much so that the prime minister can't even fly into his own country. And last week, as you mentioned, he tried to fly here to Santo Domingo, but the president of the Dominican Republic, Luis Avina de R has made it clear that Ariel Henri is persona non grata here. And that's because he says Henri is so hated that he would pose a security threat here in the Dominican Republic where there's a lot of Haitians. Wow. So if he can't even get into the neighboring country and can't get home, who replaces him as Haiti's leader? I mean, that's the question. He is still hanging on. But the jockeying for his spot has already begun. There is one gang leader in particular, Jimmy Gerrise, who is known as barbecue. And he is clearly gunning for the top job in the country. Last week, he said if Henri doesn't resign, there will be civil war. But at the same time, he's really trying to exploit the division between classes in Haiti. The last thing the elite in Haiti want is these gangs to take over. But Barbecue says, look, I'm protecting the interests of the poor. I'm making sure that the leader they don't like who they think is illegitimate will never return to Haiti. And we've also heard a name from the pastor, Guy Philippe, a former co-leader who served time at an American prison. And he says he wants to be president. And one of the core, one of his core promises is that he would offer amnesty to gang leaders. But let's not forget that these gangs have sowed chaos across Haiti. They've attacked the civilian population ruthlessly. Hundreds of thousands of Haitians have been displaced by that violence. And nearly half the country is going hungry. I guess we should note the United States has an embassy there is very influential in the country. So what is the US doing? Well, over the weekend, there was an evacuation. We were told from the American Embassy. We were told by US Southern Command that they flew aircraft to the US Embassy in Port of Prince to evacuate some staff and also to bring in some more military personnel to beef up security at the embassy. The US Embassy in Port of Prince said it asked for more security because of quote, heightened gang violence. So US Marines were sent there to essentially beef up security. Do people see a path toward calm? The answer you'll get from the US and from the prime minister is that a Kenyan led international peacekeeping force can do that. But that mission was approved last year by the UN and it has faced hurdle after hurdle and it's unclear when that might actually happen. Caracom, the block of Caribbean countries is holding an emergency meeting today. They have been trying to solve this, but they've gotten nowhere. Now they're inviting the US, France, Canada, the UN, and Brazil to the talks to try and bring this to some order. And Pierre Zeta Peralta, thanks so much. Thank you, Steve. And now the envelope, please. This is an actual emergency. Didn't need a charge. Oppenheimer blew up the Oscars. The three-hour movie about the man who created the atomic bomb picked up seven Academy Awards. And Pierre's Mandelite de Barco was in the audience last night, either Mandelite. Hello, good morning. So not a huge surprise that Oppenheimer would do so well. No, no, actually Oppenheimer was the favorite coming into the Oscars. Director Christopher Nolan got his first Oscar and his movie One Best Picture. He's been an evangelist for IMAX in the big screen theatrical experience. And this is what he said during his speech. Movies are just a little bit over a hundred years old. I mean, imagine being there a hundred years into painting or theatre. We don't know where this incredible journey is going from here. But to know that you think that I'm a meaningful part of it means the world to me. Oppenheimer also got awards for Best Cinematographer, Best Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, Robert Downey Jr., and Best Actor, Killian Murphy, who played the title role. We made a film about the man who created the atomic bomb. And for better or for worse, we're all living in Oppenheimer's world. So I would really like to dedicate this to the peacemakers everywhere. Mandelite weren't there some other mentions of Warren Peas? There were. The documentary Twenty Days in Marriople became the first film from Ukraine to in an Oscar. And as he held up his award, the film's director, journalist, Mr. Slough Cherenoff, said he wishes he never had to make the film. I wish to be able to exchange this to Russia, never attacking Ukraine, never occupying our cities. Director Jonathan Glazer, who is movie about Auschwitz and the Holocaust's zone of interest, won Best International Feature, and he was on stage with his producer. Right now we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness in the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people. You know Steve, the Oscar ceremony actually started a few minutes late because there was a protest over Gaza in the street. The streets were blocked off and I and all the rest of the audience had to walk down sunset Boulevard in their gowns and tuxes, you know, glamorous Hollywood. Once you finally made it in there, did anything surprise you about the awards? Well, you know, the movie poor things. It swept the technical categories last night and its star Emma Stone beat out rival Lily Gladstone from Killers of the Flower Moon. And Martin Scorsese's movie didn't get a single award. There were no envelope mix-ups or nominees slapping hosts like in past ceremonies, but, you know, in one bit actor John Cena paid homage to a famous Oscar's moment from 1974 when a streaker ran across the stage naked. Well, you know, you do what you can to salute the past. Go on, go on. You know, among the speeches, Davei and Joy Randolph was really quite touching. She won for best supporting actress in the movie The Holdovers. For so long, I've always wanted to be different. And now I realize I just need to be myself. Okay, it's beautiful, man, to leave. But I want to ask about one more film. I've got two colleagues here. I don't want to name them, but one of them might be Michelle Martin. So they're going by each other the other day and they say, good morning, Barbie. Good morning, Barbie. So how did Barbie do? Well, Barbie, or maybe you're Ken, uh, Director Greater Gerwig.

These are an entirely man-made disaster. Gossens say air drops of food from the United States and other countries are nowhere near enough. In one state that has banned abortion, maternal healthcare now looks very different. She had a C-section to preserve the appearance of not doing an abortion. Some doctors in Louisiana are changing how they treat patients who are pregnant and refusing to even see some patients in their first trimester.

As Joe Biden and Donald Trump square off again, we bring you the latest news from the trail and dive deep into each candidate's goals for a second term. It is not hard to see that people have run out of food in Gaza. Videos have shown people scrambling to get food on the rare occasions that a truck superior. Israel has cut off the normal supply routes since the Hamas attack on southern Israel last October where fighters based in Gaza killed more than a thousand people and took hostages. Now, an outside group says famine may be sweeping through parts of the territory. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is calling it Israel to allow more aid into Gaza. This is an entirely man-made disaster and the report makes clear that it can be halted. Let's talk about the report he just referenced to there. Welcome back. Hi Steve. What do the outside experts in this report say? Well, they say that famine is imminent in northern Gaza. Now this is a report by a group of experts who are the world's leading authority on hunger. They're called the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification or basically IPC. It's a system of evidence-based analysis of food insecurity that was launched two decades ago to track famine in Somalia. What they found in Gaza is that food is in short supply and nearly everyone is skipping meals. It noted that there's a spike in the number of young children who are cutely malnourished. So basically one out of every three kids under two in northern Gaza are cutely malnourished and some have already died of hunger. They don't have access to formula and their mothers can't produce enough breast milk because they're not eating enough. And the report says that famine could also spread to central and southern Gaza in the coming months of conditions zone-improved or if they worsen with, for an example, in Israeli assault on Rafa. OK. I want to figure out how this happened. I know that Israel cut off supplies immediately after Hamas attacked on October 7th. Just keeping that from being enough. Well, Israel's agency that oversees the aid that enters Gaza says Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7th and killed 1,200 people, is to blame for the chaos. Here's a clip of what spokesperson Shimon Friedman said about Israel's efforts to get aid in. Israel facilitates the entry of humanitarian aid via land, air, and sea in accordance with international law. It is important to note that Israel places no limit on the amount of aid that can enter the Gaza Strip. But, Steve, you know, aid groups say Israel is preventing many trucks from entering for what it says are security reasons. And most of Gaza's borders have been sealed since October 7th. You know, the IPC report notes that before the war, when Gaza was growing some of its own food, about 150 food trucks were entering Gaza daily. That number dropped to less than half or about 60 trucks a day from the start of the war until late last month. And this has created desperation in Gaza. You know, people have been shot trying to get aid in incidents with Israeli forces in the North. How do you think those videos? What do you hear from people in Gaza now? Well, they're saying they don't want these haphazard and chaotic air drops of food by parachutes, which the U.S. and other countries are doing to try to get more food in northern Gaza. And they tell MPR that they're feeding their children leaves an animal feed and have gone up to two days without a single meal. Umam Hamad Al-Hamarna, a grandmother in Gaza City, says she's foraging for leafy herbs to make soup. She says she can't find baby formula for her grandson and that there isn't enough food being sold in the market for adults either. And anyways, the prices are too high. She says it costs more than $400 right now for a large sack of flour in northern Gaza. But mostly she and other people in the North say they just want this war to end. You know, hunger is ravaging Gaza. But the health ministry says more than 31,000 people have actually been killed by direct violence mostly by Israeli air strikes and those continue daily. And Psehaba Trawi, thanks so much. Thanks Steve. Today, we have evidence that one state's abortion ban affected medical care well beyond abortion itself. The evidence comes from Louisiana where four abortion rights groups talked with doctors and patients about what they say really happens in doctors, offices and hospitals and PR obtained an exclusive first look at their report. And it defines that doctors are delaying or changing some care out of fear that it will seem like they violated abortion laws. Rosemary Westwood of Member Station, WWNO in New Orleans saw the report. Hey, the Rosemary. Good morning. Thanks for having me. Glad you're here. So what are doctors and patients saying in your state? Well, they're telling the reports authors that there has just been a huge deviation from how doctors treated pregnancy before the state banned abortion for women experiencing miscarriages, for women with atopic pregnancies. Even for prenatal care, I was really surprised to see how many obstetricians are now refusing to see pregnant patients in their office early in pregnancy. Wait a minute. You're an OBGYN. You get a call from someone saying I'm pregnant and they say don't come. That's exactly it. OBGYNs are telling their patients they need to wait until they're 12 weeks. That's because the vast majority of miscarriages happen before 12 weeks of pregnancy. So what some OBs in Louisiana are doing is just avoiding taking care of patients when they're most at risk of miscarrying. Treating a miscarriage can look the same as providing an abortion and doctors don't want there to be any question that they might have provided an abortion. Is there some danger to the patient to not be seen until 12 weeks in or later? Doctors told me that if you have a normal healthy pregnancy, no complications, it might be fine. But if you do have health problems like high blood pressure, that can be very dangerous to put off that first prenatal appointment. Doctors can't find out if you're at risk for a blood clot or if you have an ectopic pregnancy, and that can kill you. Okay, so the report identifies these problems early in pregnancy. What about later in a woman's pregnancy do things become a little more normal then? No, things are not the way they were before the state banned abortion. So Louisiana does have an exception for a pregnant person's life. And the report has cases, similar to stories we've heard in the news of pregnant people deemed not sick enough under the state's abortion ban. But the report also had situations that I've never seen or heard before in my reporting. Cases where it's absolutely clear a pregnancy is ending. And the doctors instead of doing a standard abortion procedure are performing a C section. You mean cutting open the patient here? That's exactly right. Like for example, when a woman's water breaks and the fetus won't survive, this is, you know, happens early in pregnancy. And before doctors would use drugs to induce labor or they would perform an abortion procedure to empty the uterus. But now some are performing a C section. And I asked Dr. Nicole Frihill, a New Orleans OBGYN about this. She said it's absurd to do a C section just to preserve the appearance of not breaking the law, which is ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous. The least safe thing that we do is a C section. Remember a C section is major abdominal surgery. It comes with all sorts of health risks to the patient. And it's substantially riskier than an abortion. Rosemary, I guess we should mention this report is new. So there's not a lot of reaction to that. But the concern is not new that there'd be these wider problems with medical care. Has the state acknowledged a problem here? It really hasn't. State health officials have not addressed these kinds of concerns. And Louisiana's new governor, Jeff Landry, has been aggressive in the past about wanting to prosecute doctors who break the law. Rosemary Westwood, I've W.W. N.O. and New Orleans. Thanks so much. You're welcome. And you can read more about the report at npr.org. Five states hold their presidential primaries today. The results are no longer in doubt. President Biden and former President Trump will be their party's nominees. But the voting does offer a glimpse into what matters in Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Ohio, and Arizona that is one of the states likely to decide the election this fall. Hey there. Good morning. How much does this state matter to the candidates? Well, judging by their visits, it matters to the Biden campaign a lot. Biden is visiting this week. He will be in Phoenix for a campaign event launching the Latino Skone Biden Harris organizing program. And the state is about one third Latino. So that is a very targeted effort by his president, Kamala Harris and first lady, Joe Biden. We're both also here earlier this month. You'll remember Arizona went for Biden 2020 by just over 10,000 votes. And it became central to false claims of election fraud by Trump and his supporters. Trump has not visited the state yet this year. Yet there's still a big independent electorate here that both candidates will want to win over. A third of registered voters in the state are registered as independents. And one thing to note in today's result is that that won't include them. Independent voters are not allowed to vote in the state's presidential preference election. Only those affiliated with the Democratic Party or the Republican Party are. Okay. So what issues might move those more independent voters? Arizona is in the heart of the debate of immigration as a swing state along the US Mexico border. That's a big focus of what I'm here to report on this week. So when you look at the numbers of people apprehended by border patrol, Arizona is one of the busiest parts of the border right now. Many migrants and asylum seekers are crossing here at record numbers and shelters are straining to accommodate them. A few months ago, the government had to close a legal port of entry and reassign personnel to process asylum seekers. That port closure reminded Arizona's about the impact of the pressures of immigration to them. The broader conversation about reproductive rights also could play a big role come November. Arizona organizers are working to gather signatures to create a constitutional right to abortion using a ballot measure. Democrats have used abortion-related ballot measures to encourage voters to also turn out for Democrats up the ballot. Isn't there also a Senate race in Arizona? Yeah, Arizona has a closely watched Senate race after independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema announced earlier this month that she wouldn't run for reelection. But that primary isn't until July. For the most part, what the parties are looking for today is the data that they can get, who is voting and where and why. These primaries are often used by parties to see where they already have an active electorate and where it needs work. Let me ask you about one of the other states that's voting today. Ohio is a big Senate primary, doesn't it? Yes, and this is the seat that could help swing control of the Senate. Democrat Sherrod Brown is in a precarious position. Republican represents a fairly red state and is one of the last red state Democrats in the Senate. So he has to appeal to Republican and moderate voters in both rural and urban areas. After today's voting, we'll know which Republican he will face this fall. Trump is supporting businessmen Bernie Moreno, and Republicans will decide today whether to fall in line behind him or more establishment candidates. The other Republicans are Secretary of State Frank Lerose and State Senator Matt Dolan. It was at a rally for Moreno this past weekend where Trump dug in on dehumanizing language about immigrants. So the question is if that message resonates with voters and whether Trump's guy wins the day and the opportunity to take on Senator Brown in November. And Pierce Hemeno Bostillo in Arizona, one of five states holding primaries today. Thanks so much. Thank you. And that's a first for this Tuesday, March 19th. I'm Steve Inske. And I'm Michelle Martin. Today's episode of Up First was edited by Mark Kattkov, Carrie Fible, Megan Pratt, Dana Farrington, Alice Wolffley, and Ben Adler.

Biden seeks to erase the gender gap in government research, as Gambia edges towards a world first, reversing a ban on female genital cutting. And initially, falling newspaper sales are crushing the country's iconic newspaper kiosks. It's Tuesday, March 19. This is Reuters World News, bringing you everything you need to know from the front lines in 10 minutes, every weekday. I'm Carmel Kremens in Dublin. Most of you listening right now are probably multitasking. Yet, while you're listening to me talk, you're probably also driving, cleaning, exercising, or maybe even grocery shopping. It's easy, and you could save money by doing it right from your phone. Multitask right now. Potential savings will vary, discounts not available in all states and situations. Food shortages in parts of the Gaza Strip are so severe that they've already exceeded famine levels. That's the assessment of the global hunger monitor, whose findings are relied on by UN agencies. The group says that without an immediate ceasefire and surge of food to areas cut off by fighting, mass death is imminent. In all, 1.1 million gaseons around half the population are experiencing catastrophic shortages of food. UN humanitarian coordinator James McGuldrick says any incursion into Rafa by Israeli forces would even further complicate getting aid in. And if the war's to be an incursion, that would be that system we have, which is already precarious and intermittent would then be broken. We are not in a position to contingency plan that, we're not a position to pre-position shelter material, food medical supplies and especially water during this very, very hot period. So it will be a real problem for us. The prospect of a man-made famine in Gaza has brought the strongest criticism of Israel from Western allies since it launched its war against Hamas. Netanyahu agreed to send a team of officials to Washington to hear the administration's concerns. Donald Trump's efforts to secure a bond to cover a $454 million dollar judgment in a New York civil fraud case is not going well. His lawyers say he's been rejected by 30 companies who would be on the hook for any payout if Trump loses his appeal and proves unable to pay. The former president must either pay the sum out of his own pocket or post a bond to stave off the possibility of having his property seized by the state. Britain's princess of Wales has been spotted in public and there's video to prove it. The Sun newspaper has published footage of Kate carrying shopping bags with Prince William at a farm shop near their home. It's the first sighting of the princess since she underwent surgery two months ago and comes after weeks of speculation about her health. Elon Musk says his ketamine prescription is good for Tesla's investors. The billionaire defended his use of the drug in a video interview with former CNN anchor Don Lemon. Musk says it helps him manage a negative chemical state similar to depression. The era of cheap money is officially over. The Bank of Japan has ended its negative interest rate policy with its first rate hike in 17 years. More than 60% of US abortions last year were done by pill according to a Goodmacher Institute report. The increase follows a dramatic decline in surgical abortion access after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe V Wade. Think of all the breakthroughs we made in medicine across the board but women have not been the President Biden has signed a new executive order expanding government research into women's health. The order seeks to erase gender gaps in research while pledging $200 million next year to better understand issues including menopause and sexual and reproductive conditions. First lady Jill Biden highlighting those gaps. Even though women are half the population, women's health research has been underfunded and understudy. Too many of our medications, treatments and medical school textbooks are based on men and their bodies but that ends today. Biden has also asked Congress for $12 billion in new funding for women's health research but odds of getting that money are slim in the politically divided legislator, especially during an election year. Trevor Honeycutt is out the White House. Trevor, what does this order do? So what it's going to do is it requires federal agencies from the Defense Department to the National Institutes of Health to do a better job of accounting for the money that they get for medical research and making sure that they are sending grants to issues and conditions that face women and accounting for gender specific issues when they are spending that money. So historically there's been just less money that's been allocated to conditions that affect primarily women. Menopause is a great example of this because it's something that every woman undergoes at a certain point if she lives long enough, including a lot of women who are in the workforce and it causes symptoms that force people to leave work. But scientists and medical researchers actually don't understand terribly much about what menopause does to the human body besides the most obvious side effects. And so what the NIH wants to do the National Institutes of Health, what they want to do is better study those things to get a grasp on what's happening in the human body during menopause. Sticking with women's help but this time in Gambia where a ban on female genital cutting is at risk of being overturned. Lawmakers in the West African country have voted to advance a bill repealing the ban on female genital mutilation known as FGM. It's now under review by parliamentary committees. Anne Mawaffee is in Kenya. Anne, why is Gambia looking at doing this now? They said they want to be able to practice their culture and their religion freely. One of the placards that demonstrators were carrying yesterday said, we will not sell our religion for widely gains. So sort of insinuating that this is a practice that is very respected in this community. And this kind of messaging sort of implies that the ban on FGM is a Western idea imposed on the women and now they are sort of seeking emancipation and if they vent in parliament yesterday, anything to go by, then this is highly likely that Gambia will become the fast nation globally to roll back protections against FGM. What's the potential impact of this move in other countries? Within communities there are conversations like can we be allowed to cut the girls and I'll just let you in on some of the conversations around FGM especially in my country Kenya that the challenge now is the medicalization of FGM. So yes, it was banned. There is a law that is very clear on what will happen if you practice FGM on your child, but communities went under. So they do take their girls for cutting. Some of them are taking them to health facilities. Some of them are staging parties but inviting these traditional cutters to come and cut their girls. So it just further complicates the FGM journey. It just adds to an already difficult journey in ending FGM in the continent. Italy's iconic news kiosks are dying. An industry body says two-thirds of them have shuttered over the past two years with the sharp decline in newspaper sales to blame. Christian Balmer is in Rome. Well no street corner will cover Piazza in Italy is complete without a decolata kiosk. They're often octagonal, they're often green and they're often just bedecked with newspapers, magazines. They're kind of as much a part of the urban fabric as you know your fire hydrants in New York or your pavement cafes in Paris. The couple is that Italy as in many other countries has seen an unbelievable fall-off in newspaper sales over the past two decades. And whereas newspaper editors have been able to some degree to shift readers online, it's much harder for a kiosk owner to reinvent themselves. Fabiano Pompei, whose family has been running a news kiosk close to Rome's John Lutheran basilica since just after World War II, he took over from his father but has had to pull down the shutters for one last time. He told me that you can make sacrifices up to a certain point, but after a while if you're earning little or no money you have to shut up shop and try to do something else even if it's stop wrenching. The old cities where the tourists go have been able to a degree to reinvent themselves to become basically sellers of tourist trinkets and those cartoons with handsome priests and tourists love to buy. A couple of places in Rome, if they've got a big enough square in front of them, have been able to turn themselves into sort of bars and cultural centers, but lots of the kiosks just don't have the physical space around them to make that a safe proposition. So they're vanishing at quite a fast rate and none of the kiosk owners I spoke to really thought that they had any future that in 10 years time there might be none there. That's it for Tuesday.

Plus, could pilotless planes be the future for the US Air Force? Software has created new missions and things that would not be done with piloted aircraft just because it would be too dangerous or frankly break the laws of physics as Scorri would say on Star Trek. And a new journal poll shows Donald Trump remains in a stronger position than President Biden in a likely rematch. It's Monday, March 4th. Today. We begin in Gaza, where the US began air-dropping humanitarian aid over the weekend, following similar deliveries by Egypt, Jordan and Qatar in recent days. The steps are intended to address an increasingly pressing humanitarian disaster in the Gaza strip, almost five months into the war between Israel and Hamas. Meanwhile, negotiators meeting in Cairo to secure a Gaza truce before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan appear to have hit a roadblock. We are reporting that Israel has agreed to the outlines of a deal, but that Israeli officials are uncertain about Hamas's sincerity to reach an agreement after failing to provide a list of living hostages and their conditions, a demand that mediators say Israel made over the weekend. Speaking yesterday, Vice President Kamala Harris called for an immediate ceasefire. Hamas claims it wants a ceasefire. Well, there is a deal on the tape. And as we have said, Hamas needs to agree to that deal. Let's get a ceasefire. Let's reunite the hostages with their families. And let's provide immediate relief to the people of Gaza. Harris also issued one of the sharpest US rebukes of Israel's bombardment of Gaza, describing conditions there as a humanitarian catastrophe and calling on Israel to significantly increase the flow of aid without excuses. Those comments come as a new journal poll finds US sympathy for Palestinians is growing as the war drags on with a plurality of American voters now saying that Israel has gone too far in responding to the October attacks by Hamas. One in three voters in the new survey also said the US was doing too little to help Palestinians a seven point uptick from December. And we'll have more results from that poll of American voters later in the show. Over to the Republican presidential race now as Nikki Haley has won her first GOP primary in the district of Columbia. That said caucuses in Idaho and Missouri over the weekend saw former President Donald Trump notch a further two wins ahead of Super Tuesday. Among the 15 states casting votes tomorrow is Colorado, which is awaiting a Supreme Court decision as early as today about whether Trump can be removed from the ballot. The Colorado Supreme Court has ruled that the 14th amendment means Trump is disqualified from holding public office again for engaging in insurrection against the US. Trump's legal team has appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that the former President never participated in or directed any of the illegal conduct that occurred at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. If the Supreme Court rejects Trump's appeal, he could be stripped from the ballot across the country. Japan's Nique has smashed through 40,000 for the first time with the country's benchmark stock index closing half a percent higher today. The rally follows the index hitting an all-time high on February 22, led by a surge in chip stocks. Japanese chipmakers saw gains on Monday mirroring a similarly for chip makers in South Korea. So far this year at the Nique has climbed 20 percent driven by the return of modest inflation, improvements in corporate governance, and a weaker yen. Well, one thing that may push markets to further records is the trajectory of the US economy and not least when the Fed will begin cutting interest rates. This week's jobs report could also be instrumental with the labor market expected to have heated up even further. However, the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, Lizanne Saunders, told WSJ's Take On The Week podcast that there are some hidden weaknesses in the labor market that could take investors by surprise. The January job report was for the most part positive across most metrics other than another decline in household employment. Now the prior report, even though on the surface it looked okay, the details under the surface were much more negative, including for that December report a huge plunge in household employment. A lot of people might just focus on the headline metrics and not look further from that. There's another survey they conduct which is the household survey and from the household survey the unemployment rate is calculated. And there are times like the last couple of months where you can see pretty meaningful divergence in the case of two months ago, which is a huge huge almost 700 interesting in household employment. And you can hear more from that interview with Lizanne Saunders on the latest episode of WSJ's Take On The Week. The investor group looking to buy beleaguered department store Macy's has increased its offer by nearly a billion dollars. After rejecting a prior proposal of 21 dollars a share back in December, a bid that Macy said failed to provide compelling value to shareholders, real estate investment firm Arcaus Management and Global Asset Manager Brigade Capital Management are now offering $24 per share. Both investors have said they're open to increasing their bid further, but the lack of due diligence and a non-disclosure agreement has so far led Macy's to express doubts about any potential deal. Coming up, a journal poll finds that American voters are shedding some of their pessimism about the state of the economy, but whether they're crediting President Biden for that is another story. We'll crunch the numbers after the break. Hey what's news fans, listen up. But that's not all. That's amazon.com-slash-what's-news. It's just that easy. It is a similar result as a prior survey in December, but dig a little deeper beneath the surface and voter sentiment is changing in ways that could define the campaign to come. Editor Aaron Zidner oversees the journal's polling efforts. Aaron, tell us about the foremost issues that voters see defining the race to come. Well, one of the main questions we've had is whether an improving economy would lift the fortunes of President Biden. The economy is getting stronger. All the metrics show it unemployment has been very low. Inflation has moderated. And yet, President Biden is still in a very weak position. Well, in this poll, we find something interesting. Voter reviews of the economy are starting to improve. The share of people who see the economy is doing better than before and is up 10 points. The share to say their own personal findings are doing better is up nine points. So those are comparisons with December. So people are seeing some effect in their own personal lives of an improving economy. And there is some marginal improvement in their views of how President Biden is handling the economy. But you know, it's just not that much improvement. The president is still in a very weak position. The corrosive effects of inflation are still on people's minds. And so we're getting some clues that yes, maybe arising the economy can help the President, but so far not so much. Aaron, I could imagine the White House responding to that saying, all right, we'll just give it six more months. Maybe we'll start to see the Fed cutting interest rates and come election day. This is a stronger issue for us. And yet, I note in the survey that the economy is no longer issue number one for voters. Well, that's exactly the conundrum. This poll is one of the rare cases where something other than the economy is what voters say is most important to their vote. More people by significant numbers say immigration is the top issue on their minds, not the economy. And that's bad news for the President right now because he really gets low marks. And I think it's fair to say failing marks on immigration. 71% of people say that developments in immigration and border security are headed in the wrong direction, not the right direction. And 65% disapproves of the President's handling of immigration. That tells us that it's not just Republicans who are worried about immigration, it's independence and some of them are crats. Aaron, a few other things that jumped out to me from this poll. You've got about the same number of people as late last year that think Biden is too old to run for office. Though the number who think that Trump is too old has gone up by five points. Another thing is that while voters don't seem all that pleased with how Biden is handling immigration or the economy, they don't seem all that happy either with some of Trump's foremost policy proposals, including on health care and forum policy. And then there's the issue that this might not just be a Biden Trump rematch that there could be other candidates on the ballot. Tell us more about what the poll showed in that respect. Well, when you test Trump versus Biden and then you run a ballot that has a green party candidate, a libertarian candidate, an independent migrant and a grubbered candidate and Cornell West. In just about every case Biden bleeds more of his support to those other candidates than Trump does. So in this poll, a two point lead that Trump holds when it's just Trump and Biden on the ballot becomes a five point lead. But and there are two significant bucks here. These candidates, they don't have ballot access in all the states yet. The other caveat is that Robert F. Kennedy, who is the non major party candidate who gets the most support, he gets nine percentage points support in this poll when he's on the ballot with other candidates. There's a chance that he takes more votes away from Trump than from Biden. More of his supporters is they're given only a choice of Trump or Biden. Big Trump over Biden, which suggests that this he's on a ballot. He alone, he could lead more support from Trump. Aaron, finally, the GOP primary fight is continuing. It's Super Tuesday tomorrow with 15 states voting. Does this poll reveal any vulnerabilities for Trump that could complicate his his path to the nomination potentially? I would say it's actually the opposite. The primaries so far have suggested a weakness for Trump that we don't see in this national poll. In these primaries, quite a few Republicans, especially those voting for Nikki Haley, have said they will not vote for Trump in those ever that if Trump is the nominee, even though they identify as Republicans, they would be so disappointed that they were not supporting in November. This is something we have written out of New Hampshire and South Carolina and Michigan that that Trump was having trouble holding his coalition together. That's not the true, but this poll finds that both parties have had trouble holding for coalitions together and that Biden has the greater problem. So while some Republicans don't want to vote for Trump in November, this national poll suggests that Biden has more work to do to unify his party than Trump does. Aaron, thank you so much. As always, great to be with you. And finally, could AI pilots be the future of the U.S. Air Force? As aircraft costs soar and flying software advances, the Air Force is turning its sights toward a new generation of pilot lists jets to bolster its fleet and to help deter China. Journal Aerospace and Defense reporter Duck Cameron has the details on these so-called mini jets roughly half the size of their conventional piloted counterparts. Because there's no pilots, that means that you take out the support systems for pilots, which makes them lighter. You can put fuel in there to fly longer distances, which is particularly important in the Western Pacific. And also, there should be cheaper. The Air Force is looking at something like a quarter or a third of an F-35, which gets you into a sort of 20 million dollar, a copy, price tag. The idea is that you can build more. They want a thousand and five years, which is both unprecedented in terms of a ramp in production, and also would give a very big boost just in terms of sheer numbers. Those numbers could help the U.S. match China's growing military industrial output, while Duck said that other tech advances could allow the mini jets to serve as communications hubs in the sky. The communication side is particularly important in the Western Pacific. Not just because of the distance, but because of concerns amongst military planners that jamming will stop GPS and satellite transmissions. This is where the big development of recent years comes in, and that's in terms of autonomous flying software. These planes can literally fly themselves. Yes, they can be controlled by cockpit or by controllers on the ground, but if communications are interrupted or stop altogether, they have the wherewithal to either make it to their targets or to carry out pre-plan maneuvers or indeed to return home. And that is What's News for Monday Morning. Today's episode was produced by Kate Bollivant and Hatty Moir. We will be back tonight with the new show. And until then, thanks for listening. The Supreme Court restores Donald Trump's ballot eligibility. It really puts Tares this effort to get at Trump through the insurrection clause via state courts just last week, a state judge in Illinois, removed Trump from the ballot there. This is going to end that litigation as well. And higher food prices and labor costs are squeezing independent restaurants. Plus, JetBlue and Spirit Airlines call off their merger. It's Monday, March 4. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that move the world today. The US Supreme Court has restored Donald Trump's ballot eligibility in Colorado, ruling that states lack the power to reject presidential candidates on the grounds that they engaged in a rebellion or insurrection against the US government. While the judgment was unanimous, four justices and separate opinions said the majority had gone too far in limiting ways to enforce the insurrection clause. In a statement, Trump called the ruling a quote big win for America. Let's jump into what the decision means with our Supreme Court correspondent Jess Breven. Welcome back Jess. Hi, I'm Marie. All right. So to start, what does this ruling say about states rights versus the authority of the federal government? Well, it says that states don't have any independent power to enforce the insurrection clause when it comes to federal candidates and federal elections. That means that they can for state officials, and in fact one state already has, but not for candidates for federal office or federal office holders. It also says that the authority for that enforcement belongs to Congress and Congress would need to pass some legislation explaining how you keep insurrectionists out of federal office under the terms of the 14th Amendment. So let's get into the other opinions regarding the insurrection clause because the Supreme Court didn't rule on the merits of that charge that President Trump was an insurrectionist, but they did have opinions on this clause. Can you explain what that's about? Court's in Colorado did find that he engaged in an insurrection, but the Supreme Court didn't address that issue one way or the other. All this case was about was what are the procedures for enforcing the constitutional bar on having people who engage in insurrection or rebellion take federal office? And the majority said, and that was a five-member majority, said that like some other provisions of the 14th Amendment, it needs to be addressed by congressional legislation. Before other justices all agreed on the basic point that you can't have a sort of patchwork system where each state is judging the eligibility of candidates on its own. So that that part they all agreed on the part where they disagreed was well, what about some other permutations of enforcing the insurrection clause? And one example that the three liberal justices led by Justice Sonia Sotomayor gave was what if you're being prosecuted by an insurrectionist? Could you bring up that as a defense in court and say, well, they have no right to prosecute me because they're not entitled to hold this office under the federal government? Justice Amy Coney Barrett writing only for herself agreed that the majority went too far and thought the opinion should be limited to presidential candidates. The majority opinion, which was unsigned, they use the term percurium by the whole court, said they didn't understand why the three liberals were all bent out of shape because they did agree on the key issues here on this question. And as you said before, it really puts to rest this effort to get at Trump through the insurrection clause via state courts just last week, a state judge in Illinois removed Trump from the ballot there. This is going to end that litigation as well. Just how does today's ruling impact the cases still pending against Donald Trump? You might think of today's case as really serve an appetizer for an all you can eat banquet of Trump related cases as the Supreme Court term continues over the coming months. This one was really in some ways an easy one pretty much everyone expected this outcome. The most important case still on the agenda involving Trump has to do whether he can be prosecuted for his alleged crimes related to January six and the effort to stop the transfer of power to present Biden after Trump lost the 2020 election. The Supreme Court is going to hear argument over that issue in April and we hope would have an answer by the end of June. And then there are still other Trump related cases there. There's one involving one of the charges that was filed against him. The case doesn't specifically involve him. He's not a party to it, but he will be affected by the outcome. And then there are even some ones that are maybe a bit more amusing. There's a trademark dispute over whether the term Trump too small can be trademarked for its use on shirts and souvenirs and so on. An anti-Trump guy in California wants to trademark that phrase and sell t-shirts so with it that phrase on it. So lots of Trump stuff left to go totally going to overshadow many of the other cases that are also important that the Supreme Court is going to hear this term. JetBlue and Spirit Airlines have ended their $3.8 billion merger. The decision comes several weeks after a judge blocked the deal arguing the tie-up would hurt competition and lead to higher fares. The airlines appealed that January ruling, though some analysts said overturning it would likely be long shot. JetBlue and Spirit said they came to the decision that they probably couldn't overcome the legal and regulatory hurdles. Apple has also been ordered to change its practices. The fine is one of the EU's largest ever antitrust penalties and could lead to a wider battle between the block's regulators and the tech giant. Apple said it plans to appeal the decision and said the European Commission, which is the EU's executive body, failed to come up with credible evidence of consumer harm. The fine comes as the EU's new digital markets act is set to take effect this week. The ax aim is to make it easier for small arrivals to compete against big tech companies. Coming up with diners fed up with higher prices and labor cost rising, some independent restaurant owners say they're getting squeezed. More after the break. Last week, a federal judge in San Francisco acquitted Chinese state-owned company, Fujin, Genwa, integrated circuit of economic espionage and conspiracy. The case involved an incident nearly a decade ago. Employees at the Taiwan Factory of US chip maker Micron Technology abruptly left with hundreds of internal files for a rival company that was teaming up with Genwa. The ruling was a crushing defeat in a case the Justice Department had made the centerpiece of a year's long push dating to the Trump administration to protect domestic companies from Chinese efforts to steal American corporate secrets. What the FBI and the Justice Department do is investigate cases and prosecute cases. And so they wanted to try to use that as an avenue here and as another tool and a lever they could pull. And what this verdict shows is that one, sometimes they may have pursued cases where the facts were a little bit murky and they couldn't quite pin it on the Chinese company. And so when pursuing criminal cases, they usually have the ability to serve subpoenas on a lot of people that collect a lot of information and documents and emails. And here they don't have access to information from within China and they can't get information from the phones of people that might have been involved in China. They can't build the kind of case that they're used to making and when that's the case, their cases might not end up meeting the burden of proof that they need to prove that this happened in a US court. You can hear more about this story on tomorrow's tech news briefing podcast. Higher food prices are hitting everyone, but the skyrocketing costs driving food prices up are now pushing many independent restaurant owners out. They say they're also being squeezed by higher labor costs and backlash from diners who aren't happy about paying more for their sit down meals. Welcome back Heather. Thanks so much. Heather, I'm sure many of our listeners may know restaurants that didn't emerge from the pandemic. One of my favorite diners was among them. But for those that did it sounds like what was working before economically isn't working now. Why not? Yeah, a lot of these restaurant operators we spoke to just said the business model is broken basically that prior to the pandemic they had certain ratios for how much labor should cost, how much their goods, the food should cost and then would factor in pricing with that. The pandemic really shook up restaurants, you know, like you said many closed. But the ones that survived they've gone through a lot of tumult so they have had to pay a lot more for workers and some of that was because of supply. They're just wasn't the supply of workers like they had prior and then there's other things like minimum wage increases and other mandates that they're having to deal with. So labor has gone up astronomically for a lot of these restaurants and you know a lot of these restaurants are sit down establishments where they need workers to serve the food. They're just not fast food restaurants like a lot of chains are and a lot of these restaurants bumped up prices but they feel like they can't keep bumping them up because there's almost only so much customers are willing to take. You know you go to a diner and you expect kind of an affordable meal, not a not a fine dining price. Right, it might be challenging to sort of see these dynamics behind the scenes when you're looking at sort of eye popping price points on the menus but how are independent restaurant owners dealing with all of these challenges right now. Yes, so they're trying to be smart and savvy and a lot of the folks we talked to said they're really getting in the granular details of their food costs. So they're really trying to look at maybe an ice cream sundae that doesn't make sense to serve anymore because the machine costs so much to maintain like one North Carolina restaurant we talked to or maybe they need to alter like a Denver restaurant the appetizer plate so maybe you know they have to strip out some really expensive hand rolled grape leaves and substitute some big beans for that because it's just cheaper. Maybe they have to just kind of pair back some of the staffing at certain times that they might have typically had just because they can't have that other person on staff right now because it's expensive and Johnny Rogers is the restaurant you mentioned that got rid of its Sundays they also had to make some other really difficult choices. Yes, so that Johnny Rogers restaurant the labor cost her up about 25% since 2019 the owner told us but still other employees are struggling you know just because the hourly wages are going up doesn't mean that these workers can survive and the owners actually run a holiday code drive for two of his restaurants and some of those codes going to the children of the employees because even if you're making $17.35 an hour like. One of the workers were saying it's still challenging for them to survive. What is the broader economic impact if these independent restaurants continue to struggle in the way that they have been independent restaurants are a huge employer so when independent restaurant closes you're losing those jobs and that's really bad for communities you know it's also just another empty storefront which is not good for communities either their neighborhood gathering places places that people like to be in you know it feels good to go out to eat. Gather with friends in one of those places close it is a loss. And finally Peppa Pig is a wildly popular English cartoon even among American kids now I don't really have a stake in this I only have to watch these kinds of shows when I'm visiting friends with little ones but the Peppa franchise which includes toys pajamas and theme parks made $1.7 billion in retail sales in 2022. And it was the fourth most in demand children series world wide last year according to entertainment consulting firm parrot analytics. It turns out some parents worry Peppa isn't setting the best example for their kids styles reporter Harvey Lieber wrote about the backlash. She basically embodies your typical four year old so she says whatever comes to mind she taunts her little brother George which is very classic for an older sibling. She kind of groans if her parents need to like stop for something on the way home and says oh this is so ball ring. And when I was talking to parents I found that the sort of younger age parents like millennials really had strong opinions against Peppa as opposed to let's say parents on the older range maybe in their 40s. The millennial parents that I spoke with just found Peppa to be really rude and abrasive and not a good role model for their children. And the difference for these millennial parents is that they expect more from a TV show when it comes to modeling behaviors. And of course we also heard from parents who appreciate Peppa fans say it's helpful for kids to learn that their feelings even the slightly mean ones are totally normal. And a senior executive at Hasbro which owns Peppa Pig said they see her not as too direct or rude but as self assertive and self confident. And that's what's news for this Monday afternoon. Today's show was produced by Pierre Bianna May and Anthony Bansi with supervising producer Michael Cusmedi's. We'll be back with a new show tomorrow morning. Thanks for listening.\",\"In a shift in its policy toward Israel, the US pushes for an immediate Gaza ceasefire at the UN Security Council. Plus, new signs that US mortgage rates could stay higher for longer. In the last couple of months, the biggest increase in sales has been for homes that went for more than $1 million way, way, way above the national average. And we're seeing this in other parts of the economy where people on the lower income spectrum are getting harder hit by higher rates. And genocide fears resurface in Darfur as the war for control of Sudan rages on. It's Friday, March 22nd. The US is set to raise its diplomatic pressure on Israel today as it brings a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, up for a vote at the UN Security Council. It marks a shift in Washington's approach to the war in a forum where it has usually defended Israel and comes as Secretary of State Anthony Blinken travels throughout the Middle East to promote a ceasefire that could unlock more humanitarian aid for Gaza. Here he was in Egypt yesterday. There's a clear consensus around a number of shared priorities. First, the need for an immediate sustained ceasefire with the release of hostages. That would create space to surge more humanitarian assistance to relieve the suffering of many people and to build something more enduring. While it is rare for the US to back a UN resolution that Israel would oppose wording in the draft that mentions restarting operations in Gaza after a pause could prompt a veto by Russia or other permanent security council members, as could the call that the ceasefire be tied to the release of hostages from Hamas as Israel has demanded. In Washington a marathon effort to fund the federal government could be nearing the finish line today as House lawmakers are expected to pass a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills that would approve funding for the Defense Department and several other federal agencies for the rest of the fiscal year and wrap up a contentious process that's brought the government to the brink of a shutdown several times. After approval in the House, the Senate would have to agree to speed up the usual timeline for bill consideration in order to prevent a shutdown just after midnight tonight. And facing federal corruption charges, New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez says he won't enter the Democratic primary for his seat this year, but he is leaving open the possibility of an independent reelection bid. Menendez has pleaded not guilty to charges of bribery and conspiring to act as an illegal foreign agent, and he's remaining in office as he contests the charges. However, his announcement signals that he may be bowing to political realities as state Democrats appear ready to move on from the scandal plagued lawmaker. Coming up, troubling signs that history may be repeating itself as our Africa Bureau Chief shares witness accounts of atrocities committed in Darfur, two decades after mass killings in Sudan drew worldwide attention. We've got that story and more after the break. I lost my uncles and my grandaunts, so sorry. Yeah, there's a lot of loss- Yeah, there is. ... and a lot of pain. Yeah, even a lot of pain and a lot of missing. That was the voice of Huda Humza, a refugee from Sudan's Darfur region, which is in the throes of a civil war. And her story is just one in a grim pattern of atrocities perpetrated by mostly Arab fighters against the region's Black indigenous communities over the past 11 months. Officials say these acts are a continuation of the mass killings in Darfur two decades ago and are being revived amid a broader war for control over Africa's third largest country. The Journal's Africa Bureau Chief Gabriele Steinhauser has spoken to more than four dozen refugees as well as aid workers, diplomats and international experts who are monitoring the violence in Darfur and documenting abuses against civilians on an industrial scale. Gabriele, I imagine many listeners will be aware of the genocide in Darfur 20 years ago. Tell us though, what has happened there more recently. So what happened was that last April we saw a war breaking out between Sudan's top two generals, one commanding the military, the other one commanding this militia known as the Rapid Support Forces, which is basically a successor to the Janjaweed that a lot of listeners may remember from that earlier genocide in the early 2000s. So these two guys with their respective fighting forces are battling for control in Sudan. Now in Darfur, which is this region in Western Sudan, this war has kind of created an opening for what a lot of people watching this say is really a continuation of the atrocities that we witnessed in the early 2000s, which the US considers a genocide. Gabriele, you have spoken to dozens of people in refugee camps and you're reporting seems to suggest some of the details about how systemic killings and other atrocities are being carried out. What are you hearing? Right. I mean, we went to interview refugees in refugee camps in Chad, just across the border from Darfur, and it was just striking, you randomly walk up to somebody and pretty much everybody has some horrible story. They've either lost relatives, some people had been shot themselves, some people had been beaten themselves. It's just that the scale that was so incredibly striking, I mean these are not sort of random acts of cruelty, but really well organized acts that the US government has said amount to ethnic cleansing, deliberate attacks on women, on children, on civilians. So we've spoken to women who were raped, who were beaten, who were shot point blank while fleeing with their children on their backs or holding their hands. And this militia at the center of this, the Rapid Support Forces, it's the successor of the Janjaweed and the way they're going about this really seems to be informed by their experience of the early 2000s. Almost every refugee I spoke to, they had their phones stolen. And yes, this is part of looting for financial gain, but it's also a way of destroying evidence of avoiding footage of atrocities and the people who committed them filtering out to the wider world. I also spoke to experts who use satellite images to document atrocities, and they're saying in several cases it seems like the RSF was taking advantage of cloud cover to perpetrate attacks. They also regularly knock out civilian communications. So there really seems to be a concerted effort to stop the world from seeing what is happening in Darfur. Gabriele, the details that you've picked up on in your conversations with people fleeing Darfur and the fact that this is in some ways a runback of what occurred 20 years ago I think is hard to stomach. Why is the international community not more aware of this conflict? I think in many ways there's just a bit of atrocity fatigue. We have two very big high profile conflicts taking place at the same time. There's obviously Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There's Israel's war in Gaza following the terrorist attacks of October 7th, and that is taking up a lot of oxygen. Gabriele, what consequences is that lack of attention from the part of the international community having on the ground? I mean, any aid organization you speak to will tell you that they're having an extremely hard time raising funds to help those refugees who've actually made it out of Sudan as well as the millions of people who've been displaced inside Sudan. The World Food Program warned just last week that if they don't get more funding, they will have to stop food aid in Chad to Sudanese refugees as early as April. So that's just in a couple of weeks, and that would take us back really to the situation that Huda and others experienced when they first arrived in Chad, where there was just nothing. And the only people who were around to help them was the Chadians who were already living in these villages that were suddenly flooded by refugees desperately fleeing these atrocities. In that time, I saw there's no life at all because I haven't even a cup of water to give my children, but the community which exist here, so kindLuke Vargas: Gabriele, given that you've now documented that these atrocities are happening and we can hear from some of the people who've experienced them, is it clear what the outlook from here could be? Is there any indication you're reporting some of the awareness that's trying to be drummed up here could have an effect, could possibly change things? Well, I do think that there is finally a little bit more attention being paid to what is happening in Darfur and Sudan more broadly. So the US just announced a special envoy who's now traveling the region to find avenues for negotiations for a serious peace negotiations. We also have a resolution in the Senate by a bipartisan group of senators who want to recognize the current atrocities as another genocide. And after the article was published yesterday, I got a message from one of the aides of one of these senators and he's passing around this article to raise awareness and get people on board for taking action. As for the warring parties themselves, I haven't seen any serious signs that they are open to actually ending this war. They seem committed to fighting this out until one of them wins. So I fear that what we're going to see just in the coming weeks and months is more human suffering at a moment when millions of people are according to the United Nations on the brink of famine. Gabriele, thank you so much for bringing us this story and making us aware of the situation there. No, thank you for giving it some more airtime. I appreciate it. Mortgage rates in the US are likely to remain higher than most people are expecting, despite indications from the Fed that interest rates will come down later this year. Federal mortgage lender Fannie Mae, is now predicting that rates on a 30 year fixed will stand at 6.4% by the end of the fourth quarter, an increase from its prior view of 5.9%. Alex Frangos is a Journal finance editor. Everyone's hoping to get back to the good old days before the pandemic when mortgage rates were impossibly low. Part of the reason they were so low is that the Fed was buying mortgage bonds artificially suppressing the market. And we know that the Fed is not going to doing that anytime soon. And so as the market normalizes, the Fed rate cuts, they will cause mortgage rates to come down, but they're not going to come down as fast as they would have previously. Yesterday's home sales data revealed a pickup in the overall housing market, albeit primarily for sales in homes worth over $1 million as high interest rates continue to disproportionately affect lower income households. The number of Airbnbs available in New York has dropped dramatically over the past six months since the city put in place short term rental rules. Hosts now have to go through a lengthy process in order to register their properties with the city and get a license. And as Travel Reporter Allison Pohle explains that means that visitors have fewer options if they're looking for a short-term rental for their stay. There's so many legal challenges to getting this type of regulation in place and Airbnb and the city went back and forth in court for years before this actually went into effect. They have said that they hope the city revisits the regulations, but they've also said that no one city makes up a large portion of their revenue because they do business in so many places. People are confused. There's just a dramatic drop in the number of listings available. People don't think necessarily to look at Airbnb in the city anymore, or if they do they find such limited options. So if people aren't considering Airbnb for their New York travels, then that could affect the way that they approach staying in a short-term rental when they travel to various cities. New York's Office of Special Enforcement has approved approximately 1700 short-term rentals, and some 3000 are still under review. And before we go a heads up that we've made a correction to last night's episode. In that show, we incorrectly said that 17 states were involved in the Justice Department's antitrust suit against Apple, when in fact 15 states in the District of Columbia had joined the suit. And that is What's News for Friday morning. Today's show was produced by Charlie Duffield and Kate Bullivant. Our supervising producer is Sandra Kilhof. We will be back tonight with a new show. Otherwise, have a great weekend. Thanks for listening.  Who's fueling the surge in shares of Donald Trump's SPAC? It's just like GameStop. We see some fireworks and that euphoria is back. We're seeing the same meme, stock craze, but this time with a touch of politics mixed in. And at least 40 people were killed in an attack at a concert venue outside Moscow. Plus, Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, is being treated for cancer. It's Friday, March 22nd. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that move the world today. We start with a developing story. In Russia, authorities say explosions rocked a concert hall just outside Moscow and gunman opened fire on concert goers Friday evening, killing at least 40 people. The Federal Security Service said more than a hundred others have been injured. Authorities are investigating the incident as a terrorist attack. For more on this developing story, head to wsj.com. Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, says she's being treated for cancer. Since she underwent abdominal surgery in January, her absence from royal events has fueled concerns and rampant online speculation about her health. Today, she did not reveal what type of cancer, but said she was in the early stages of preventive chemotherapy. We hope that you'll understand that as a family, we now need some time, space, and privacy while I complete my treatment. My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I'm able. But for now, I must focus on making a full recovery. The announcement comes at a challenging time for the British Royal family, King Charles III is also battling the disease. House lawmakers have narrowly approved a $1.2 trillion package of bills in the hopes of averting a partial government shutdown at midnight. The measures would approve funding for the Defense Department and several other federal agencies for the rest of the fiscal year, wrapping up a lengthy and contentious process that's brought the federal government to the brink of shutdown several times since late last year. Congressional Reporter Katy Stech Ferek says the bill's now in the Senate's hands. Katy  This morning a big piece of the puzzle was settled when House lawmakers passed this bill. It was incredibly narrow. It really came down to the wire. More Republicans voted against the bill than for the bill, and that was a big signal to Speaker Johnson that a lot of Republicans are unhappy about the lack of conservative wins, that they feel that he was able to secure. Speaker Johnson's in a tough position, he doesn't have a ton of leverage with the Democrat controlled Senate and President Biden, the bill will head over to the Senate for a vote. And the good news is it appears that there are enough votes to pass the legislation into law. The question mark that we have is whether or not they can do it in time. If the Senate doesn't approve the bill before midnight, Katy says there could be a limited shutdown on the weekend, but that would likely have a minimal impact. Coming up, Donald Trump's social media platform is going public. Who's investing in it, after the break? Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social hasn't performed so well as a business, but it could be the best investment the former president's ever made. Today, investors approved a plan to take the company public via SPAC or Special Purpose Acquisition Company. It's expected to begin trading next week under its new ticker, DJT. Those are Donald Trump's initials. And the former president's, 60% stake is worth roughly $3 billion. Of course, that's depending on how the stock trades, but could it really help save Trump's fortune? Welcome back, Charley. Thanks for having me. All right. So Charley, this involves a company we haven't mentioned on What's News in a while, Digital World Acquisition Corp or DWAC. That's the shell company taking Truth Social public. It's been on a tear recently. In fact, it's giving me a little bit of that meme stock d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 vu. So who is pouring money in and why? It's like GameStop all over again. The main driver of this investment are diehard supporters of former President Trump who want to see him back in the White House and they want to see him get this windfall you mentioned. Let's make Trump a trillionaire one poster said. And it is based on support for the president and his brand rather than a long-term investment based on the underlying fundamentals of the social network. How well is it performing? Well, it's just like GameStop in that when people band together and all buy a troubled beaten down stock at the same time we see some fireworks. And as markets have come back to all time highs and that euphoria is back, we're seeing the same meme stock craze, but this time with a touch of politics mixed in. So let's talk about Trump's finances. We've reported this week that he hasn't been able to secure a bond for a $454 million judgment against him in a civil fraud case. The New York Attorney General can begin enforcing that judgment and seizing his assets next week. So how could this SPACs performance potentially help his financial situation? Will it be enough and in time? Yes. Well, the thing about stocks is if they're valuable, you can sell them and turn them into cash. And Trump needs money both because he's running for president and the additional issues that you just nodded to, such as this judgment that he needs to settle. These shares are under a lockup for about six months after they begin trading. So he can't do that right away. Now, there's a wrinkle here though because you could get a waiver from the company leadership to sell your shares sooner than that. And since this company is run by supporters of the president, it's quite possible to be open to that sort of thing. But even then things get complicated because selling that big of a stake of a stock without affecting the price is very hard to do and you have to be able to keep the price where it is to be able to monetize that stake at the price you have in mind. And what about Truth Social as a business, it hasn't done so great as a company. What is the outlook? It's not looking great. Their latest securities filing said they did about 3.4 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2023, which is the most recent data we have. Operating losses were about 10 million. And then when you add in interest expense, the net loss was about $49 million over that period. So maybe this episode gives the stock a little more publicity. It's hard to build a startup in a world with big competitors like Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter and other social networks as well. It's a crowded environment and a tough business to break into. And so the question is, where does Truth Social fit into that landscape, and so far it's been a struggle. Apple is working to widen its artificial intelligence capabilities. As part of that, we report exclusively that the tech giants held preliminary talks with Chinese company Baidu about using its generative AI in Apple devices in China. Reporter Aaron Tilley says Apple's been talking with a range of companies, including Google and OpenAI as it builds out its own tools. Apple's AI work and its AI research is challenged in some ways. It's very privacy and device centric, so it's not sending a lot to the cloud, which really limits the size of the AI models they can build. And the kind of data that they can collect is quite limited too, which also limits the size and the scope of their models they're able to build. So as they try to catch up in this race for generative AI, they're building it in-house, but they're also looking at what's out there in the world and how they could potentially incorporate an external AI system to power some of their products because they're really looking to bring generative AI to basically all their software. Working with Baidu could also help Apple navigate regulatory hurdles in China. People familiar with the matter say Apple's been looking for a local partner there, mainly because China requires generative AI models to be vetted by its cyberspace regulator. Chrysler's parent company, Stellantis is laying off about 400 employees in the US, mostly in its software and engineering divisions. Stellantis confirmed in a statement that it plans to reduce its engineering technology and software organizations in the US by about 2%. It's the third round of white collar job cuts Stellantis has made in the past year. In 2023, it offered buyouts to around 9,000 salaried US workers. Car companies have been trying to reign in costs during a bumpy transition to making more electric vehicles. And if you're looking to book a trip anytime soon, you may want to consider who you and your bag are flying with. Most major US carriers did a better job of handling your checked luggage in 2023 than they did in 2022. That's according to data from the Transportation Department, which keeps track of those lost, delayed or damaged bags. But things got worse at United. The airline blamed bad weather last summer for its issues, still it outperformed American, which for years has brought up the rear. Among nine major US carriers Allegiant performed the best. And finally, if you're in a book club that meets online, you've probably met your club mates in real life at some point. But some book clubs these days work the other way around. Our Social Media Reporter Alexa Corse joined an online book club and wrote about her experience. You could call it the new book clubs you meet online, but then you party in person once you get to know the people and then deciding, \\\"Okay, let's become real life friends.\\\" There's a shared interest there. It's an easy conversation starter. If you know you like the same beach reads and you've read about them, that makes it a lot less scary to go than meet up with a bunch of strangers in person because you'll have that to talk about. And obviously this is the promise of the internet from the beginning, but social media hasn't always led to great things. So it was really nice to take a chance to write about social media actually bringing people together in a meaningful way. My book club came together through real life and the internet. I posted online during the height of the pandemic to see who'd be interested in meeting virtually. This was back when we were all still in quarantine. The original members were all people I knew in real life, but they also recruited their own friends and everyone got to meet someone new. Still, not everyone has met in real life yet, even though we're hopeful about going hybrid.

It's been a busy week in U.S. politics. So don't go away, we've got all the important updates. I'm Scott Simon. From hoping for a ceasefire in Gaza to dropping aid there instead. What's America's influence in the Middle East like now? At home, a U.S. state may end its decriminalization of many drugs. Oregon State Legislature just voted to recriminalize possession there. And it was election day in Iran. Thousands competed to fill the country's parliament yesterday. Including the powerful so-called assembly of experts. So who looks victorious?

Board of visits by President Biden and Donald Trump, the Senate Minority Leader and the Supreme Court. And here senior Washington correspondent, Netater Ron Elvin, joined us to review the weekend politics and preview the one coming up. Ron, thanks for being with us. Good to be with you, Scott. President Biden began the week by saying he hoped for a ceasefire in Gaza by Monday. He has ended the week without that prospect and says the US is going to drop aid to hungry people there. What does it say about US influence in the current conflict? It says our power to bring even a temporary pause in this war is quite limited. We can try to bring the warring parties together and we have, but both sides still seem determined to achieve something they want by force of arms. This is expected to resume on Monday in Cairo and Ramadan begins a week after that. There's hope, but we also have the fallout from what happened this week when a crowd came to meet an aid con boy. Accounts differ, but at some point Israeli soldiers started shooting. There are reports of more than 100 dead and hundreds wounded or injured. The UN Secretary General is calling for an independent investigation. US Supreme Court will hear arguments in April about Donald Trump's claims that as former President he's immune from prosecution, what are the implications? Enormous. With his added delay, the case may not be resolved before November and that would leave an unprecedented question hanging over the election. That's why special counsel Jack Smith asked the high court to take the case last year, assuming that the justices would want to have the last word sooner or later, but the court said no then the circuit court of appeals should rule first, they said. Now the appeals court has ruled unanimously and resoundingly rejecting Trump's claim of immunity. The Supreme could just let that ruling stand, but instead they're going to hear the case themselves seven weeks from now and rule on it sometime after that, maybe by June. Both President Biden and Donald Trump visited the US Mexico border Thursday. Run, what do you make of the fact that according to Gallup, the number one campaign issue for 2024 is not the economy inflation, crime racism, the war in Ukraine abortion rights or the budget deficit, it's immigration. The percentage saying immigration went up from 20% to 28% in one month, that's a lot. That suggests the economy must be doing better, inflation must be coming down and all those other issues are just a little less salient at the moment because immigration seems to be a worsening problem or certainly a more prominent one in the news. It's also the issue generating the most visual sense of crisis. So we are all seeing lots of video depicting a difficult situation as out of control. How naive does it sound for me to ask you around? What are the prospects for a bipartisan deal on immigration enforcement? In one sense it's not naive at all, Scott, the Senate has in fact reached just such a deal thanks to a 50-50 bipartisan group of senators who worked on it for weeks, month, really this winter. The party's compromise and yet it could create the toughest border regime in generations. But of course, actually doing something about the border would take the edge off the issue politically this year. So Trump has made it clear he's against it and Republicans in both the House and Senate have now blocked further consideration. Mitch McConnell stepping down a Senate Republican leader in November, what do you think he'll be remembered for? He'll be known as longest serving leader in either party in Senate history. But he himself says his greatest accomplishment was keeping President Obama from filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court in 2016. A McConnell would not even allow hearings on that nominee. That not only allowed Trump to fill that seat, it also allowed him to campaign on filling that seat. And it gave religious conservatives a reason to vote for him. The three justices he was able to appoint as a result have since overturned Roe v. Wade and half a century of abortion rights. Super Tuesday, Tuesday. What are you watching? With the delegate totals, these 15 states voting on Tuesday will do what the early voting states did. Pile up delegates for Biden and for Trump. The only real suspense concerns, what Trump's last challenger, Nikki Haley, will do next. And Piers, Ron Elvin, thanks so much for being with us on a busy week. Thank you Scott. Oregon State Legislature has voted to recriminalize drug possession. And the governor has indicated she's open to signing the bill. Derek Vanderhart with Oregon Public Broadcasting joins us. Derek, thanks for being with us. Hey Scott, begin by telling us please what's in this new bill? Yeah, well, there's a lot in the bill. I mean, the reason you and I are talking about it is because of one specific piece that would make possessing small amounts of drugs, a crime punishable by up to six months in jail. That is a stark difference from the law. Oregon has operated under since 2021 when drug possession became a violation similar to a traffic ticket. But you know, this is not merely Oregon reverting back to the old days. The Democrats who wrote this bill insist they're putting forward a sort of kinder, gentler approach to criminal justice. The bill offers drug users the option of avoiding a conviction if they agreed to seek treatment. And even when people are put in jail under the bill, they could be released in order to participate in drug treatment. The other major thing the bill would do is expand access to addiction services for drug users in Oregon, which I think many people see as the most important piece. Oregonians voted it to criminalize drug possession in 2020. Already? Right now there's an overhaul. What happened? Yeah, I mean, I think a couple things. The first is that the system envisioned under that ballot measure you mentioned has been very slow to emerge. This was based on the idea that addiction should be addressed with healthcare rather than police and jails. But Oregon stumbled when it came to creating the treatment services that were necessary for that to happen. The second thing is that decriminalization really coincided with a growing fentanyl crisis. That's led to a surge of overdose deaths here. It's created public disorder, things like open drug use on the streets of Portland. That has convinced I think many people that things aren't working. And some of the state's richest people have begun backing a ballot measure to end decriminalization. That I think put a lot of pressure on lawmakers to act since many of them thought that measure would be harmful. Was there opposition? There was. You know, this has been a very hard fought debate here. And I think an extremely tough call for many Democrats in particular. One senator said yesterday there are hard votes, harder votes, and then there was this vote. But lawmakers wound up supporting it anyway. Republicans have wanted to end decriminalization for years now. They argue criminal consequences are necessary to fight addiction. Democrats have been far more wary, as I say. But in the end, I think they were moved by the threat of that ballot measure. And meanwhile, advocacy groups and some drug treatment providers have been very adamant that this decision is a mistake for Oregon. They believe the state is retreating back to a failed war on drugs. And they can credibly point to numbers that suggest it will be felt disproportionately by people of color. What happens next? Well, the bill moves on to Oregon's Democratic governor, Tina Kotech. She doesn't like to show her cards when it comes to bills. She hasn't done that entirely at this point. But she has, as you say, said she's open to signing it. I think she's widely expected to sign it. Assuming that happens, there are big questions about how this new law will mean going for what it means. Criminal consequences would kick in in September. The state estimates show that they are likely to funnel more than 1,000 people into the criminal justice system every year. That is certain to create issues in Oregon, which has a pretty severe public defender shortage. And I don't think it will just be the courts. This is a brand new system that would be implemented here. I think everyone expects it could get a little rocky. Derek Fanderhart with OPB. Thanks so much for being with us. Yeah, that's my pleasure, Scott. Thousands vied to Phil Iran's parliament during election day for a day. But voters seem to ignore calls to turn out. And here's Peter Kenyon, his following the story of her misdemeanor. Peter, thanks for being with us. Hi, Scott. How'd the voting go? Well, the official statement is everything went fine. No problems. Turn out, however, seems quite low. Iran has long argued that its regular staging of elections is itself a sign that it is infected democracy and argument long dismissed by Western officials and other critics. Here's how Iran's English language press TV channel framed the election before polls opened. Top Iranian officials say huge turnout in the elections will give the country great advantages in the international arena. The leader of Iran's Islamic revolution has also emphasized that people's participation in the voting will make friends of the nation happy and will disappoint the ill-wishers. But voters show no inclination to make the government happy, calls to boycott the vote. They began to surface well before election day. And many Iranians apparently decided to heed those calls. And the results being described as possibly a record low turnout. We're waiting for the final figures. And this continues a trend of declining voter participation in past few years. Even as recently as 2017, President Hassan Rouhani was on the ballot then. Some 70% of eligible voters reportedly turned out. That's how most Iranian elections used to be staged. High turnout was normal. Not so much these days. Rouhani by the way was among those candidates blocked from running for the assembly of experts this time. Peter, what's being said about the low turnout? Well critics of course say it's a public repudiation of the cleric led government. And this vote was held after a rocky period. This was the first election since the death in 2022 of a young Kurdish Iranian woman, 22-year-old Masa Amini in the custody of Iran's morality police. She'd been picked up for allegedly wearing her Islamic headscarf improperly. Her death sparked massive anti-government protests in what was deemed the biggest public challenge to the government since the Islamic Revolution back in 1979. Now this time ahead of this election, top officials including the Supreme Leader, including the president tried to exhort the electorate to turn out in large numbers, apparently with little effect. Now the parliament really not that big a deal. It's not a heavyweight player in politics and Iran. But the vote is a sign that the country's leaders want to do what it takes to keep the country in a hard line conservative course. And how was that conservative course likely to play out in the days ahead? Well, it will likely maintain around the general hostilities to the west. That was probably never endowed. But it could also have an impact on future leadership of the Islamic Republic. And that is coming back to this assembly of experts, one of those uniquely Iranian bodies. I had told how many's term as a Supreme Leader runs until 2032, at which point he will be 92 years old. So it's entirely possible that these clerics being elected to the assembly now, they will be the ones who select how many successor or Iran's next Supreme Leader. And here's Peter Kane, and in this done, Vol, thanks so much for being with us. Thank you, Scott. And that's up first for Saturday, March 2nd, 2024. I'm Aisha Roscoe. And I'm Scott Simon.

I'm Harris Faulkner. Monday, March 11, 2024, I'm like a manual. A big moment in American politics is expected tomorrow when special counsel Robert Hurr is going to testify on Capitol Hill about his investigation into President Biden's handling of classified documents. The idea that he's not capable of being held accountable for violating the law and holding classified documents when he had absolutely no right to do so, but he's capable of running the country. And Lisa Brady, blockbuster weight loss drugs are helping people to eat less, but they don't address eating too much of the wrong things to begin with. And you have an insatiable hunger that's like a runaway freight train and her big pharma to capitalize on it. But who's creating the problem? Big food. And I'm Joe Conchin. Special counsel Robert Hurr is expected to testify Tuesday about his findings in his investigation into President Biden's retention of classified documents as a private citizen. Florida Republican Congressman Byron Donald says the president should have been charged with wrongdoing. Having a poor memory does not absolve you from violating the espionage act. Being old and elderly does not absolve you from violating the espionage act. There's also the fallout following President Biden's state of union address, which critics say was highly partisan. The president went after House Republicans for not taking up a bipartisan border bill which passed the Senate. And November, my team began serious negotiations with a bipartisan group of senators. The result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen. Oh, you don't think so? Oh, you don't like that bill, huh? That conservative has got together and said it was a good bill. Alabama Republican Senator Katie Brits says the president needs to look at his own responsibility for the border crisis. Minutes after coming into office, he stopped all deportations. He halted construction of the border wall and he said I am going to give amnesty to millions. Those types of things act as a magnet to have more and more people here. The president and former president Trump held dueling rallies in battleground Georgia over the weekend. Mr. Trump blasted Biden border policies for the death of a Georgia nursing student allegedly murdered by an illegal migrant. Lincoln Riley would be alive today if Joe Biden had not willfully and maliciously eviscerated the borders of the United States and set loose thousands and thousands of dangerous criminals. House Republicans were successful in impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Now a select number of those GOP members are preparing for a potential trial in the Senate. We really have to focus on the decisions that were made to essentially erase both the northern and southern borders. Wyoming Republican Congressman Harriet Haguemin would be an impeachment manager. That's what this impeachment is focusing on is the fact that he has violated federal law. There are two primary statutes that I think you've got to look at. One of them states that you cannot do a mass parole into our country. The parole statute allows them to parole particular individuals on a case by case basis. For example, let's say that there is a family that comes over from Mexico and the child gets sick and they need to go to the hospital. What they would allow them to do is they would parole mom and dad with the child to go to the hospital. But that doesn't mean that you parole another million people into the into the country simply because one child needs medical care. That is, but that is exactly what they've been doing. They have been parole entire categories of people say everyone from Venezuela gets per annulated to the country, not on a case by case basis. I would focus on the statutory provisions. Another very important statutory provision states that if you are going to come here and seek asylum, we shall, we must, we are required to hold you in some kind of custody until your asylum claim is resolved. And so that's another area that I would go into. I would cross examine or question the that their decision to not hold people in custody. What would you say to critics who claim this impeachment effort is a partisan attempt to remove a cabinet member? I think that I've just laid out why that's absolutely not true. One of the challenges that we've had with this administration is I would describe it almost as a form of anarchy. Our government is based on the idea that there is a rule that we will adhere to the rule of law. So if there's a speed limit of 75, we drive 75. If there's a stop sign, we stop. If you don't do those things, you are considered to have broken the law and there can be and should be consequences for that. Yet with this administration, we have the people at the very top that are breaking the law. And an example is Joe Biden, who despite what the Supreme Court has said with student loans, has continued to attempt to forgive student loans, even though he has absolutely no legal authority or right to do so whatsoever. And I would say the same with me, Marcus. This is not partisan. It doesn't matter to me what administration is in place. If we start allowing or start turning a blind eye to or start ignoring or start excusing the idea that the people at the very top are not subject to the rule of law, we've lost our country. We've created a two-tier justice system. And so I often say that usually anarchy comes from the bottom. It's people who are attempting to overthrow the government. The bizarre part of what we're living through right now is the anarchy is coming from the top. It's coming from Joe Biden. It's coming from Mayorkas. It's coming from these folks who are literally not just ignoring the law. They are blatantly violating the law and saying, so what are you going to do about it? What steps do you want to see taken to help the crisis at the border? And why do you think your party so heavily opposed the Senate border bill negotiated by Senator Langford? So a couple of things. We have to finish the wall. We have got to finish the wall. What I've been down there and I've been to two locations where the wall was left unfinished, but they built roads so that they could finish the wall. And what you see is just massive numbers of humanity coming through in those particular areas. So that's one of the things that we have to do. We also have to do the remain in Mexico policy. There's just no question that we cannot incentivize people to come to this country by saying, if you come here illegally 10 years down the road, you may very well get thrown out. But in the meantime, we're going to, you're going to have children here. You're going to have grandchildren here. You're going to embed yourselves in the community. And then you're going to have the Democrats scream and jump up and down and run their clothing, pull their hair and say, wait, wait, wait, we can't be deporting these people. They've been here for 10 years. So we've just got to fundamentally change the way that we are dealing with this. As far as the Senate bill, that is not a border security bill. That is an amnesty bill. HR2 is a border security bill. And it gives us the tools and gives our border patrol the tools that they need to actually secure our border. The Senate bill was, I would describe it as a joke. I would describe it as downright dangerous. It would allow between 5,000 and 8500 people a day to cross into this country illegally before there would be any kind of restrictions imposed. Well, the people aren't stupid. The cartels can figure that one out. They can start figuring out how to send people across so that they send 5 to 8500 people a day. In addition to which, it would allow the president to declare an emergency and say 8500 people isn't enough. We need more. Let's look 10,000 in. We've got a surge on the border. We've got a caravan that has shown up. We need to look 20,000 in today. And then another thing is that that restriction only lasted until 2025. And then it was again, Katie Barthedore, as many as they could possibly shove across that line, that barrier, the non-existent barrier, I guess you'd say, they would be able to do. And the money that they were requesting, and I think it was $15 billion or $20 billion. It was to process people more quickly. It was not a border security bill. And people need to understand that it was an amnesty bill. I don't know how long Langford got taken for a ride, but he did. And it was a bad bill that none of us can support. Special counsel Robert Her will testify this week in a public hearing on his findings. In the case of President Biden's mishandling of classified documents, you sit on the Judiciary Committee. What will you be looking to find out from the special counsel? Well, I think that we're all very, very interested in his personal observations of the president. It's rather to a strange time that we're living in when we are told that we cannot believe our lying eyes. You watch President Biden. We know that he is not capable of actually managing and overseeing this country and acting as president. I heard just confirm that. He had the personal ability to do that, and he confirmed it. And for me, I want to talk to him about why in the world wouldn't you charge him the idea that he's not capable of being held accountable for violating the law and holding classified documents when he had absolutely no right to do so. But he's capable of running the country. I think what we saw the other night in the state of the Union address is someone who they had obviously given him medication so that he could stand up there and yell at us. But all he was doing was reading a teleprompter. And anytime that he went off script, you could see that he was nothing but a befuddled old man. So I just, I kind of want to watch how this develops and watch and engage with Mr. Her on what his observations were. You touched on the president's state of the Union address and what critics are calling a hyper partisan speech. Would you make the address? I thought that it was horrific to have the president stand up there and as partisan as he was just sit there for an hour and scream at everybody. You know, it was just, it was, it was a very bizarre thing to observe. Congress avoided a partial government shutdown this week, but there's another funding deadline looming two weeks from now when basically legislation for defense, state and Homeland Security departments will have to be passed. What's your sense of how far apart the parties are on those negotiations and do you think a deal gets done? You know, one of the things that I've been so frustrated about becoming here is that I believe that the American people know that this is a situation that can be solved and resolved, but we have political leaders that don't allow that to happen. We're heading towards $35 trillion in debt. We're heading to the situation where our interest payments exceed what we spend on defense. We have agencies that have gone rogue, such as the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and others that are lately violating people's constitutional rights, such as the First Amendment. In fact, when New York has came before our committee, that's what I focused on is the manner in which the Department of Homeland Security is violating citizens' First Amendment rights. And yet, the Congress fails time and time and time and time again to use the power of the purse to rein in these agencies and to force them to adopt policies that are in the best interest of the American public. So I voted against the monstrosity that was passed last week because it is a budget bill. I voted against the monstrosity last week and I will vote against the one this week as well because we're not being serious about actually cutting spending and actually cutting out programs that are not just bad ideas, but at this point are incredibly destructive to our republic. So I will continue to vote against these bills so long as we refuse to use the power of the purse to go in and take out programs that should not be funded. And that we continue to refuse to hold the administration responsible for the bad decisions that they're making. Congressman Harriet Hagueman of the Great State of Wyoming. Thanks for your time. Have a great week. Thanks Mike. I'm Guy Benson. Join me weekdays at 3pm Eastern as we break down the biggest stories of the day with some of the biggest newsmakers and guests. Join me for my brand new podcast, Searching for Heroes. Make sure you subscribe to this series wherever you download podcasts and leave a rating and review. Millions of Americans are seeking help from what's become a multi-billion dollar industry. The blockbuster anti obesity drugs that began as treatments for type 2 diabetes, including oz. Govy, a high dose version of oz. The first approved by the FDA for weight loss in 2021 followed by zet bound a new version of mongaro last year. And some users are clear right about their goals and how it works. The main reason to use it was to cut back on some of those apodite impulses and eating impulses so that I could build better habits. These drugs do help with hunger by imitating hormones that would normally help regulate appetite after you eat. Satiety hormones both versions target a hormone known as GOP one. The drug in zet bound in mongaro also targets a second hormone. And all of this got even more attention lately when Oprah Winfrey announced she was leaving the Weight Watchers Board to eliminate any perceived conflict of interest the company said. After disclosing she was using a weight loss medication. Though even weight watchers now has plans that include medication. In a recent Pew Research Center survey nearly three quarters of Americans had heard of ozempic wagovian similar drugs but more than one third think they'll do not much or nothing at all to reduce obesity in America. And there is concern about losing side of the bigger picture on health and wellness. Beyond the potential side effects that these drugs can hold. The fact that they are not in any way a permanent solution. The fitness trainer Jillian Michaels is a certified nutrition and wellness consultant best selling author and business woman. And they are not only essentially denying the underlying factors of why the American population is becoming more and more obese. I find it to be very alarming. There's been such a boom in drugs like ozempic for weight loss that that analysts at Goldman Sachs are actually projecting it will boost overall economic growth. Part of the reason for that being is fewer people miss as people miss fewer days of work and the costs of poor health care, the cost of poor health are reduced. Is this something that's sustainable? So if we were to look at these drugs in detail, right? And what I've done now is instead of getting into this scary warning label on the back of the cigarette box. I like to paint you the most optimal scenario. So let's say you're one of the 50% that has zero side effects. You lose a good amount of weight. Fantastic. As a result of the weight loss, other biomarkers will improve not because of the drug, but because of the weight loss, which is also fantastic. Now, all of the studies done on these drugs have shown us is that somewhere around 68 to 72 weeks, you will plateau. So at some point, right, you have to find a way to not be as hungry. And we can get into why people are so hungry because that's what these drugs do. The impact appetite on the gut brain access and essentially curb your hunger. So you eat less, but eating less, you lose weight. And that's how these drugs facilitate weight loss, right? So at some point when they stop working, you've got to figure this one out on your own. Now here's the thing. If you get off of it, all of the meta-analysis show us that the vast majority of individuals put all of the weight back on and then some two thirds in the first year alone. With these drugs, you never get off of them. They do stop working. And we simply do not know what this looks like in 10 years, 20 years, we don't know. And the way the drug companies are responding to this plateau is by creating what's called a double agonist or King Kong triple agonists. So essentially, these drugs mimic satiety hormones, right? And there are many different satiety hormones. CLP1 is just one. So what other pathways can these drugs act on, right? It's like, ah, damn it. We've plateaued on this one or it didn't work for that person. Well, this one works on two satiety hormones. Ah, hold on. This one works on three satiety. So we just keep pushing the up button. At some point, there is a brick wall that you're going to slam into. And I wonder what happens then? And then the most important part of this conversation that we're not discussing is that you can just eat less and just move more and you will get better result. How do people do that? Why are we so hungry? How do we change them? So first, let's look at the physiological component, right? Our bodies are supposed to regulate your hunger, right? The idea is, okay, you know what? You've eaten enough here. You're good. There are a bunch of different mechanisms in the body that are supposed to take over and tell you stop eating. So the question becomes, why is that not happening? Okay. Well, what's going to trigger these satiety hormones like GLP1 or trillocystic kind end or leptin? What's doing it? Well, sleep. Okay, great. That's one way. Hydration is fantastic, that's another. But protein, fat and fiber are what are going to have the biggest impact on releasing satiety hormones. But if we're not putting in good things, everything goes in the wrong direction. Michaels uses soda as an example, probably about 250 calories of processed sugar, no protein, fat or fiber, which means no release of those helpful satiety hormones. Just the opposite. You release it on insulin. Your pancreas goes, oh my gosh, there's so much sugar in the blood. Dump insulin, this is dangerous, and you become hypoglycemic. These foods are also designed to match the dopamine center of our brain like nicotine, cocaine, they're highly addictive. So they not only do not release satiety hormones, they make you hungrier, and they're psychologically addicting. That's the second part of this conversation. Why are we psychologically hungrier than ever? We are socializing less and less. Everybody is existing behind the screen. I mean, we're more stressed than ever, and we're seeking coping mechanisms. Hence the reason people turn to things like alcohol, sex, nicotine, all of these different drugs that are releasing dopamine. We want to drip dopamine. We don't want to dump dopamine. These foods dump dopamine, and we become addicted, physically, psychologically, for all those different reasons. And you have an insatiable hunger that's like a runaway freight train and her big pharma to capitalize on it. But who's creating the problem? Big food. Well, we have an obesity crisis, right? So obviously, trying to tackle that is a very tall task, especially when you have celebrities like Oprah admitting, oh, by the way, I'm using a weight loss drug as well. It turns out, does that make it harder to try to convince people to, you know, that that's not the easy way out and think about the actual, you know, alternatives to changing your eating habits and your lifestyle? How do we do that? You know, if this wasn't easy way out, I want to be very clear. I'm taking it. I would capitalize on it professionally. I would take it personally. And most of the weight loss industries are selling these drugs. If you look at apps like NUME or companies like Weight Watchers, they're in the business. I would get in the business of a massive fitness app. Very easy to do. And that's what you need with these drugs. You need exercise because you lose muscle at an alarming rate. So if it wasn't easy way out, I promise you I would take it. And I see this because it isn't about judging people for being lazy, being weak. No, it's because I think it's the exact opposite of that based on the data. So it is concerning because there are certain individuals that are obviously very influential. Now, with that said, Oprah might love this drug. She's not a health expert. She doesn't cling to be. She's not a MD. She's not a PhD. And she's not somebody like me who talks to MDs and PhDs all along because that's my business. Mortis curaging is not the celebrities because it's not their responsibility. They're not out there saying, I'm a health expert. I'm a doctor. I'm a scientist to take this drug. It's the medical community itself. That's really where I'm feeling let down and not by everyone, but by many. And I think it's because of the way our medical system is set up. And healthcare is in industry. Obesity is a massive industry with a compound annual growth rate of over 9% a year. And as you mentioned, these weight loss drugs are arguably the best selling drugs in the history of pharmaceuticals. It is a huge, huge business. One other thing and it is kind of a broad question, but if someone is struggling to make a change in health and fitness for themselves, what is the best way to get started? The first thing we need to tackle is the simple science of weight loss, weight maintenance and weight gain. And it is irrefutably without question calories in versus calories out. I'm not talking necessarily about the optimal diet, right? There's a diet that's not become quite famous called the Twinkie diet. I've done by a professor of nutrition. And he illustrated that by simply eating less crap, you lose weight and you improve all your biomarkers, shocker, just like ozempic, is that ideal? Of course, it's not. It's one Twinkie is better than two Twinkies. And the reason is because it's less calories in. Once you get through that part of it, you need to look at the psychological components of why you are driven to eat. Is it loneliness? Is it anxiety? Is it comfort? Is it a coping mechanism? For certain people who dad bought, I got kind of, I got kind of apathetic, I got stressed, I got overwhelmed, I got built to pay, I got depressed. Can you improve those things via results and exercise and community and culture? You know, one would hope. Usually yes. Gillian Michaels, celebrity fitness trainer, New York Times bestseller. Thank you so much for spending some time with us. It's absolutely my pleasure. I really appreciate being on. Here's a look at the week ahead. Monday, President Biden will release his proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year starting in October. It faces an uphill battle in both the House and the Senate where legislation funding for the current year has yet to be passed. Tuesday, the Special Counsel investigating President Biden's handling of classified documents is expected to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. Robert Hurr ultimately decided against pressing charges, saying in his findings he found the President had trouble with his aging memory, including recalling dates and details. Wednesday free agents in the NFL can officially be signed, taking one step closer to the beginning of the football season. Notable names include quarterback Kirk Cousins and Russell Wilson. Friday, Swifties can get another taste of the Ares tour. The Taylor's version of her concert film premieres on Disney Plus with added songs including Cardigan and an acoustic version of Maroon. And that's a look at your week ahead. I'm Anna Eliopoulos. Joe Concha What's on your mind? President Biden's state of the Union address was several things. Devices loud, scrappy and unhinged. All of this came with a portrayal of America close to Utopia in terms of its economy. A top issue heading into this election as it always is. Our economy is the end of the world. The President declared our inflation is the lowest in the world, he also said. Fact check at 3.1% inflation last month. That claim around our inflation being the lowest in the world ain't even close to truthful as in dozens of countries have a lower inflation rate than ours per multiple fact checks. Context by the way, inflation was at 1.3% when Donald Trump left office, it's 2.5 times higher than that now. But besides that, meanwhile, the economy is not the end of American voters. A recent Financial Times poll shows that 14% of voters, 14, mind you, believe they are better off under Biden. One Democrats are sour with less than 1.25%, saying life is better under this president. And when zeroing in on which president could handle the economy better, the former one in Trump tops Biden by a 20 point margin that's according to a recent NBC poll. Many pundits also talked about a possible pivot the president would make on immigration during the address, likely watched by more than 20 million people across multiple networks. But the pivot never came. With Biden instead pointing the finger of a catastrophe he created at the U.S. Southern border at Ding Ding Ding Republicans, actually the president can fix the border right now. He doesn't need Congress. All it takes is reversing some of the 91 executive orders and actions. He took just days after office reversing critical Trump borders in policy that has led to the unsustainable flow of migrants coming across the border right now, more than 7 million. Here's some context. 35 U.S. states don't have a total population of 7 million. Biden could have ordered resumption of wall construction and reinstated remain in Mexico policy. He did neither. Instead pointing to a toothless immigration bill that does not resume wall construction or remain in Mexico as somehow being the solution. But perhaps the most notable moment of the one hour eight minute address was Biden being shamed into saying the name of Lake and Riley. The 22 year old nursing student brutally murdered on the campus of the University of Georgia while out for a jog by an illegal migrant. Lincoln Riley is who Mr. Biden referred to Lincoln Riley as. Cauldron innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal. Then he talked about consoling the parents and saying how he also lost his son so he knows how they feel. I'm pretty sure the president doesn't. He should have picked up a phone and called those parents days ago. In the end, this state of the union address will be forgotten quickly. They all are after all. Most of the last time you watched the state of the union and three days later you can remember one thing that was said. So while this was a speech that was great for the MSNBC crowd, the CNN crowd, the New York Times and Washington Post crowd as far as reaching those independence in key states like Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, it didn't reach those folks and those of the folks who decide elections.

Some legal wrangling puts a Texas lob back on hold that would see local law enforcement arresting undocumented immigrants. When I see it over there, they say, you know, that we have to get together and find a solution and work together. Don't turn into political issues. I'm Dave Anthony. U.S. citizens stuck in Haiti keep trying to get out to escape gang violence and overrun parts of the country. We take you to its border with the Dominican Republic. The State Department has told Americans that are traveling by land to border crossings like this one to travel out their own risk. This is gang. A lot of it is gang control territory and to keep a low profile. And I'm Jason Rant. A Texas law would make illegally crossing the border into the U.S. from Mexico a state misdemeanor punishable with jail time. Under SB 4, Texas judges would have to order undocumented migrants deported and local law enforcement would have to take migrants to the border. But this law, SB 4, was blocked by a federal judge. He said it threatens the fundamental notion that the U.S. must regulate immigration with one voice from the federal government. A panel of the fifth circuit court of appeals reversed that ruling, but Tuesday the Supreme Court said the law could be enforced while the legal arguments in this case play out. Hours later, a different panel of the fifth circuit said, no, the law cannot be enforced as they held a hearing playing out the legal arguments Wednesday. Everybody's concerned about the border. Texas has a real crisis going on here. Texas has decided that we are at the epicenter of this crisis. We are on the front line. And we are going to do something about it. Texas solicitor Aaron Nielsen told the fifth circuit court that Texas has a right to defend itself. And under any possible reading of that right, at least some applications of SB 4 are constitutional. But Justice Department attorney Daniel Tennis says Texas goes too far that they want to put people in jail for being undocumented. State judges will be making determinations about the legality of someone's entry into the United States. And that was something that this court in farmers branch and the Supreme Court in Arizona said states simply are not supposed to be doing. At a Texas policy forum summit, Texas governor Greg Abbott highlighted the number of actions the state's taken without federal approval, including building more border wall as an unprecedented number of migrants arrives. What's going on in the border is nothing short of catastrophic. While the case continues to play out and may end up back before the Supreme Court and a bid for the high court to consider the merits of the case, Mexico's president criticized the bill Wednesday saying they will not accept deportations from the Texas government calling the law dehumanizing. We can continue working with a long star operation that we would have and we can do it. Tom Schmurber is the sheriff of Maverick County, Texas. What we have is an MOU, which is a member of the understanding of the state, the troopers. Anything that is arrested here in this county, Maverick County, they take him to a better day, which is over there in the Texas and they'll process him over there and they're going to miss him straight over there and then send him to another jail. It's fine, but it is going to be different. I don't think I don't have the space in this jail right now. I don't have the power. No, the technology. It takes me 45 minutes to do one single individual here to book them. You know the immigration I've got to hear by one by one, they're going to get the company groups. Right. You just referenced. You said if you have help from a lone star, that's the operation put into effect by the governor of Texas there, Greg Abbott, you had previously said it was helpful this year when the governor under Operation Lone Star sent you guys, I guess hundreds of state law enforcement officers to that area. How did that help you and how do you foresee them maybe helping you moving forward if SB 4 is enforced? It helped me a lot at the beginning, a lot up till now because we have that understanding that they're going to help me. They're helping me right now and doing all this booking and the administration putting all these immigrants in other jails and he gave us a lot of a grant which is called long story operation grant, good money. But now the second grant that came in was given instead of to the church department, it was given to the county county attorney. So now I have to request whatever they threw him and he sometimes will not agree with what I'm asking for. I haven't had a meeting yet with a trooper or a captain made sure anything refers to how we're going to do it. So I'm still waiting. Yeah, one of the questions before the appeals court, one of the judges asked the attorney for Texas, how all do you think this law is going to be enforced? How will things work? Well, the other thing is that we are not going to deport anybody because it all depends on the judge. The what I understand is we have to apprehend one and write a mob for trespassing and then see if we've been just straighted. It's a state law. And the court takes a long time. Eventually, I want him more space for immigrants nor criminals that are in this area. Now Sheriff, the head of the border sheriff's coalition, the sheriff of Hidalgo County, he said that he thinks they aren't equipped to be immigration agents and do the kind of work that SB4 is calling for. Over the years, many sheriff's departments have had 287G programs, though, that's allowed them to work with ICE or call ICE when they're dealing with a suspected undocumented migrant. It's not the exact same as SB4, but do you agree with him that deputies aren't really equipped to do the kind of work that SB4 in particular is calling for? Well, the deputies are not really trained for immigration work, but we do work with immigration. We work with ICE, which is SSI, we work with US Marshals, and we do work with other agencies and it's very important for us to work together. And that's the main thing. We'll work with that. We have deputies, but the other deputies we have are kind of new. They'll stay long with us two or three years, and they'll change. But we do a pretty very competent, I've retarded with the board role and I've been very comfortable, competent, that we're going to have another assistance, assistance from the ICE department, of the marshals, and of course from the state, the troopers. The couple months ago, I've read that you'd said that you were afraid of the high number of people coming, especially of the certain types of people that might be among them. I wonder, can you compare what you're seeing now as a sheriff in Maverick County, 2023-2024 to what you dealt with as an agent back after 9-11? Yeah, before that, it was just a simple immigrants that come into work and I didn't make groups, you know, I can tell they were just regular people that are coming here to work and not to stay. The majority were not here to stay. But now this will change a lot. This is kind of like an open doors and people who are coming here to stay to stay. And of course with that, the criminal element took advantage and we had to drop someone through here, burglaries, and we had one situation where an immigrant from Honduras raped one of the senior citizens, a family which was like 74 years old, you know. So it changed a lot. Very different. Along the Rio Grande River in the Eagle Pass area is a 47-acre park, Shelby Park, where state law enforcement erected concertina wire on top of shipping containers, blocking migrants from entering. While there was a legal fight over access to the park between the federal government and state government, the Supreme Court eventually said the federal government, in this case, border patrol agents, could go ahead and cut down that concertina wire. But no one ever said specifically that Governor Abbott couldn't simply order troopers and state law enforcement to put more wire back up. It appears the wire hasn't been cut down and the flow of people since has shifted west to Arizona and California. I feel bad for the mayor because they had an 11-teamities that was going to happen. You should be responsible. They have a PST, a Coney PST, that's so important. Of course, I don't know if they're going to lose any money. But if it's working, that's fine. I mean, as long as it's working, they'll send them somewhere else. Don't worry, it's fine. I didn't see the words. Anything that works to stop. So what do you mean by that? Because there was a big fight between the Biden administration, right? And local officials there, state officials there, I should say, about how things were being handled at Shelby Park and the high court saying they could go ahead and cut down that concertina wire. But then it didn't end up being cut down really by the border patrol, I guess. It was left up maybe. I don't know what the status is. But even though that wasn't done by the federal government, that was done by the state government, those troopers and state folks put up that wire and put those shipping containers on there. I mean, how do you feel about that? Well, I don't think that the wire stopped anything because there was still a comment even the way it was there and so forth. I think that the state government had several meetings with the state government from Mexico. I think they had enough to do with it too, you know, not just the physical thing, you know, but I think that it worked a lot talking to another governor. And I think that the government had a meeting with the president from Mexico. So maybe they helped a lot, 100%. And I know you've been talking to people living in Maverick County, but also probably some migrants yourself or maybe you've heard from your deputies about what migrants say. What are you, I guess, what are you hearing about why people are here, where they want to go once they're here, what they want to do? They don't want to stay here in the border. You know, they don't want to stay here. They don't want to get to stay in here. They're going up north. A lot of people are saying they're going to go to New Jersey. Chicago, some other states, you know, up north, that's what they want to go. And they're asking because they're saying because they want to find a chapel there. They think there's another job. They think there's good money, but they know they're here in the border. I mean, we don't have a lot of jobs for, for the expression for the immigrant. So that's what I hear that they want to keep on going for north. And are you hearing that a lot of people are not just from like northern triangle countries and, you know, Mexico, these folks are from all over the world. We've seen that in a little video, but I mean, yeah, I said to them all over the world. And the majority of the people that are coming in are having those skills. So I don't know, I think they're going to have a hard time trying to find a job. The only job that's going to find are going to be hard labor. I mean, but not the hard ones skills. Have you, has this been frustrating at all to you seeing the high numbers of people or watching the political fight in DC, you know, between Congress and the White House? Have you been frustrated? And what would you, I guess what would you want to have happen? What I see over there, DC, you know, that we have to get together and find a solution and work together. I mean, don't turn into political issue because the situation, it's already out of control. So and the right person officers like us, we're in the middle, you know, trying to see what's going to happen. So if they can work together, it really, really worked together. I think they would have a solution right away. And this problem was not, but it had to take the two parties to find something, some kind of solution. Did you think that border bill that the Republicans said what didn't go far enough? Did you, would you have liked to have seen that past or no? Well, I don't know the details, but if that was the solution, I'm hoping, you know, for the situation to keep on going on and on and on. You know, so I don't know if they were waiting for the elections or something like that, but still we have months ahead of us. Sheriff Tom Schwarver, thank you so much for joining us. You're welcome. Thank you very much for having me. Parts of Haiti are lawless with no government in place anymore. Oh, yeah. People of Haiti wake up. That man's among the many residents distraught in Haiti's capital port of Prince where gangs have taken control, fighting each other in violence that's left innocent civilians among the dead. The situation hates 80 faces as tragic. It's a crisis of epic proportion that's been building for a long time now and has no easy solutions to it. Republican Senator Marco Rubio posted this on X. Our number one priorities are number one US citizens and their loved ones who are there may be trapped and able to get out. It's important that we secure their well-being. We're also concerned, obviously, for the poor people of Haiti who are suffering, but again, there's not a lot of good options in the short term when you have roving gangs of maniacs who are killing and slaughtering people. The hope is that they'll be able to bring some stability there through some security force that is supposed to come eventually from Kenya. The meantime several hundred Americans have found a way out, but it is not easy. We take you now to the border there. So this is the main border crossing out of Haiti into the Dominican Republic in Dabaung. Super important for the Haitians considering what's happening in their country, but also it is an exit point for foreigners, particularly Americans, to get out of Haiti. So what we've been seeing here is a very controlled situation, the Dominican military and their version of the border patrol is cessed front, has the situation controlled here. We have not seen a mass exodus of Haitians in this area. We are about a six hour drive away from Porter Prince and about a couple hours away from Cap Hation. So these are the two cities in which we've seen a lot of the action, but we've seen about 400 Americans who have used this border crossing to leave Haiti and the State Department has told Americans that are traveling by land to border crossings like this one to travel out their own risk. This is a lot of it is gang control territory and to keep a low profile. Yeah, let's get into what's happened in Haiti. You mentioned the Capitol. Porter Prince is where the biggest problems have occurred with gangs overrunning the streets and overrunning neighborhoods taking over. Is there much government left in Haiti in the port in the Capitol? No, as a matter of fact, there aren't really any elected officials at all that are in any position of power to govern. So right now what you have is a Haitian capital that is 80 percent under the control of gangs and it's not just one gang, it's many gangs up to 200 rival gangs are now in control of the Haitian capital of Porter Prince. And the one name everyone talks about is barbecue Jimmy Sherze is the top gang leader reportedly and his name is barbecue. That's his nickname. And so there are fractions we are already seeing of different gangs that are taken to the streets and not only are they attacking one another, they're attacking civilian infrastructure schools, police stations, government buildings have all come under attack as these gangs battle one another. And the latest crisis really started on February 29th when barbecue the gang leader started to launch these attacks against government infrastructure in a way in which there were left, you know, bodies were left on the public streets and the crisis really kind of took a new foothold. And he did this to force the prime minister, Ariel Henri, to resign. And so the prime minister said that he would, while he was outside of the country, he would resign once a transnational council of Haitians that represent different political groups who's put together to choose a new president and effectively choose a new government. There is no acting real parliament, no acting president or prime minister at this point with the resignation of Ariel Henri that can control the Haitian people or the government and bring peace. And so in that power vacuum, you've got 200 gangs that are rivaling one another and this is where you're getting the violence. And there is no guarantee that these gangs are going to respect any new government that's put in place. How is the US dealing with that? How can we get Americans or others who were trapped there in the capital out? We did have the military go in to deal with embassy employees, right? And staff at the embassy, but that's all the military's done. Am I right? Yeah, I mean, that is, and there are lies the interesting situation here with how the State Department is handling this because the initial conversation last week was towards the end of last week was, you know what, Americans, we have told you for the last four years, it is a level for State Department warning. Do not travel to Haiti. We've warned you. There were no active evacuation plans last week to get Americans out. And then over the weekend, all of a sudden we saw the one in only charter flight as of now from the State Department, organized by the State Department, take off from Capacien with over 30 Americans on board. But since then, all we've heard from the State Department is that they are continuing to explore safe evacuation routes out of Haiti. But there are about a thousand Americans who remain stranded in Haiti. The Marines have gone into Haiti, but only to evacuate non-essential staff from the Port of Prince U.S. embassy. So ultimately, you've got American civilians who have been left to their own devices to travel at their own risk by land or to reach out to rescue nonprofit organizations like Project Dynamo or like we've seen with Republican Cory Mills who took it upon himself, a combat veteran to lead two rescue operations to save at least 23 Americans. So at this moment, the State Department over the last five days continues to say that they're exploring evacuation options, but we have not seen any new charter flights of any significance. And the U.S. says they're now trying to get more evacuation options secured between the Port of Prince and into the Dominican Republic, the capital of Santo Domingo. It's closest neighbor and from there Americans would then have to on their own figure out a way to get out of DR. Obviously, Haiti's a poor country and they've had a lot of problems in the past with hunger and humanitarian crises. This certainly is going to add to that. Can any humanitarian supplies get into Port of Prince or even capheixion? Yeah, the United Nations has opened, there have been containers of humanitarian aid in the UN. We have a way to get containers of aid inside of Port of Prince and to Haiti, but the United Nations has been warning for a while now that they are in dire need of more money and of more help. It's something like $640 million with a humanitarian aid is what the UN says Haiti needs and they've only received less than 10% of that money that the UN says this nation needs to provide the kind of aid to nations who desperately need it right now. We're talking about 1.4 million Haitians who face famine, over 360,000 Haitians who have been displaced in their own country. You've got the violence, you've got no working government and you've got a situation now where it's dire. You speak to Haitians here in the market and Daha Bum Dominican Republic again and this is the location where we are is really critical because there is a buy national market that allows Haitian migrants to come in for a day, a couple days a week and buy and sell the goods they desperately need and they come by the thousands and go right back to their country. It's an important market for them right now but we spoke to some Haitians there who said frankly they do want an international police force to go in and take care of the gangs and you can also see on their faces they are tired. It is one woman told me she's got six kids and she lives in one room, she has no house and she says it's just crisis after crisis. They put it in a new president and then there's another president after. She was just so exhausted by it all but she is still pleading with the international community to help and then Dominican say the international community has to come in and help and then they hopefully that the Haitian government, a new government can work with the DR, it's closest neighbor to kind of turn the page and try to get after what has been just crisis after crisis particularly over the last 15 years. Brian who would lead an international force that would go into Haiti? I mean I know that Caribbean leaders are working to try to come up with some sort of a transitional government. How much does the U.S. get involved in this international force? Yeah absolutely this is a U.S. led effort to bring Caribbean leaders, there was a conference in Jamaica in which they decided to negotiate with Haitian political groups and to create a transnational council who then will decide how to move forward with general elections which have not taken place in Haiti since 2016 and how to move forward with installing or putting in a new president and a new government. So that is being led in part by the U.S. and with other Caribbean nations and then in terms of the international police force that is being led by Kenya. He had agreed last year that they were going to be doing this but it has stalled for various reasons. Funding and concerns domestically with Kenya about whether or not they should be even doing this and why they would be doing this. Even recently there's been some concerns about U.S. funding for this force but the Kenyans still say the Kenyan president says that they still plan on leading an international police force but there are no guarantees here and there is a lot of skepticism that a new transnational council will get it done that they will come to some consensus and that a new government can ever be formed that will get the respect of some 200 rival gangs. So a lot of questions left here and you hear and all of that also logistical questions as to how this is going to happen because the Dominicans want nothing to do with getting involved in any kind of an armed conflict or even the appearance of an armed conflict with their neighbor. There is a concern all the chaos and Haiti could lead to an exodus of Haitians fleeing to the U.S. We've seen that before. You may recall the controversy in 2021 when more than 10,000 Haitian migrants gathered under a bridge at the Mexican border in Del Rio, Texas. Republican Florida governor, Rondis Santos, has deployed crews off the coast to intercept any boats carrying Haitian migrants. Florida Fish and Wildlife Officers, interdicted a vessel that had 25 illegal immigrants, potential illegal immigrants from Haiti in their boat and their vessel. They had firearms. They had drugs. They had night vision gear. Governor DeSantis has also threatened to fly Haitian migrants to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, something he's controversially done before with other migrants who are here illegally. Absolutely we can see an end flux. It hasn't happened yet. The Dominican border authorities here tell you it has not happened yet, but that always remains a possibility. As that situation gets worse, people are going to be wanting a way out. There are up to a million, maybe two million. There isn't really an official number of Haitian migrants who have found life and are living in the Dominican Republic because they simply cannot live in Haiti and there's been over 100,000, about 150,000 Haitians who've come to the U.S. over the last couple of years. So Florida is preparing for a potential exodus, but so is the Dominican Republic. The president here, I spent the last couple of years building a border wall, 100 miles worth of border wall that we visited, and you also have the Dominican government continuing its deportations. The United States is concerned about an exodus, but you better believe that Haiti's closest neighbor, the Dominican Republic, is extra concerned and they have made order security a high priority. So right now, no mass exodus, but they are prepared for anything at this point with the gangs still very much in control of Haiti's capital. It was a front row seat to the crisis in Haiti right along the border in Daha Bone in the Dominican Republic. Brian, thanks very much for joining us. Really appreciate it. Thank you so much. Mate the American who was the founding father that put the work in working man. George Taylor was born in Northern Ireland around 1716 and immigrated to America where he became an Ironsmith in Lehigh, Pennsylvania. Taylor originally wanted to study medicine, but like many other Irishmen found work as an indentured servant from the Durham Iron Works on the Delaware River. Empowered by the ideals of American independence, he worked tirelessly. Shouveling coal into a blistering furnace and eventually worked his way up to a manager position. According to the Durham Historical Society, Taylor's skills undeniably surpassed Iron Works, which caught the eye of the Iron Mill owners wife and savage. Taylor assumes a position as the head of the operation and soon married the recently widowed Anne the next year. Aside from running the mill, Taylor was also a member of Pennsylvania's committee of correspondence and even served as captain for the state militia. When America finally won its independence from Britain, Taylor was one of 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. He then utilizes expertise of the Iron industry to assist the continental army in developing cannons, cannonballs, and other military equipment. Taylor forsaked financial gain to completely dedicate his life to fortifying and independent America. After contracting a deadly illness, he retired from public service and later passed away on February 23, 1781 in Easton, Pennsylvania. He was 65 years old. George Taylor's story embodies the American dream and represents the contributions of Irish Americans to the forging of our Great Nation. Full up a chair and join me, Rachel Campos, Tuffy. And me, former US Congressman Sean Duffy, as we share our perspective on the discussions happening at kitchen tables across America.

As the crisis that our border escalates, Democrats are working tirelessly to deflect attention from the alarming reality that illegal immigrants are committing crimes in American cities coast to coast. Democrats are acutely aware that every time an illegal immigrant commits a crime, the spotlight inevitably falls on their complicity. In the aftermath of the tragic murder of Lake and Riley, a young nursing student allegedly by an illegal immigrant from Venezuela, Democrat mouthpieces rushed to peddle the same tired narrative that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than American citizens. No one is arguing that illegal immigrants commit more crimes than Americans, unless of course you count their unlawful entry. The issue is that they commit crimes at all while being in the country legally. These crimes wouldn't occur if our border security was effective. In my latest book, What's Killing America? Inside the Radical Left's tragic destruction of our cities, out right now on Amazon, I expose the fallacy of data-driven claims about illegal immigrant crimes. Take for instance, the astonishing number of illegal immigrants charged with crimes in West Coast states like Washington, Oregon, and California. Are you ready for it? The number is zero. Thanks to sanctuary state policies that prohibit law enforcement from inquiring about citizenship status. When you're charged with shoplifting in San Francisco, hit and run at Portland or assault in Seattle, citizenship status is not ascertained due to sanctuary policies. This lack of documentation creates a distorted picture of crime rates, especially in sanctuary cities where cases potentially leading to deportation are avoided. When an illegal immigrant commits a crime and avoids jail time through diversion programs, their citizenship status remains undocumented. Now if crimes are intentionally left unpunished to conceal citizenship status, how can we trust the crime rate data? Furthermore, the influx of unknown illegal immigrants crossing the border complicates accurate assessments of their crime rates compared to American cities. While Democrats downplayed these crimes, innocent Americans suffer the consequences. Almost this month, a tragic incident received little national attention. An illegal immigrant with a lengthy criminal history is accused of killing a 27-year-old Washington State trooper, Christopher Gatt, who left behind a wife and two-year-old daughter. According to court documents, Raul Benitez Santana admitted to drinking and smoking weed before allegedly crashing into the trooper's vehicle north of Seattle on Interstate 5 early one week and morning. Ice confirmed Santana is in the country illegally from Mexico. This unclear when he entered this country illegally, but he served jail time twice since 2013 and was initially charged with a crime that would have made him eligible for deportation if only anyone was legally allowed to ask about a citizenship status. This is just one example of how illegal immigration leads to preventable tragedies. Democrats open border agenda has real consequences, as more innocent Americans fall victim to crimes that could have been avoided with stricter immigration policies. It's time for Democrats to acknowledge the dangers posed by illegal immigration and prioritize the safety of American citizens over political agendas. The denial of this reality only perpetuates the cycle of crime and victimization in our communities. I'm Jason Rantz, author of What's Killing America Inside the Radical Left's tragic destruction of our cities.\",\" To begin today's episode, let's hop in the podcast time machine, shall we? Josh can I get some like beep-boop sounds? Great. We're traveling back a decade to 2014. For Elle Williams' Happy is the best-selling song. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappears into thin air. ISIS declares an Islamic caliphate. And the Republican Party clinches a majority in the House and the Senate in the midterms for the first time in a decade. Back then the classic country club Republican, who was well off and well educated, made up a larger slice of the pie, and their candidates were typically Russia hawks and proponents of free trade. And then along comes a New York celebrity who shakes it all up. They're taking our jobs, they're taking our manufacturing, they're taking our money. Today, as Trump's legal troubles mount, we take a look at some of the other storylines forming around the GOP presidential candidate. On this special episode, our political journalists examine what 10 years of polling data says about his party, and the Messianic terms his supporters in Christian media increasingly refer to him in. Plus, the third party thread beginning to compete for some air time. I'm your host, Jonah Greene. Riders has worked with Ipsos polling for many years on presidential elections. We'll publish weekly polls on presidential candidate approval ratings in the lead up to the November election. But this week, our data and politics team published a different kind of analysis. They looked at 10 years of data to better understand the overarching changes in the Republican party. Scott Malone is our politics editor and Washington DC. Scott, remind us what the party looked like in 2015 before Donald Trump ascended. I mean, really sense Ronald Reagan, the Republican party was seen as, you know, generally very focused on defense, very concerned about Russia in general, very supportive of three trade, which is something that was a big priority for corporate America. And they tended to nominate for the White House, kind of longstanding leaders along the lines of Mitt Romney and John McCain. How has the party shifted according to the data that you guys went through? There's been some really, really profound shifts in the party. Certainly you see a less hawkish policy today. One in five Republicans according to our word is Ipsos polling, say that the US should often use its military muscle to achieve foreign policy goals. That's down from one in three a decade ago. And we've seen about a five, six percentage point decline in support for the idea that free trade helps the average American. And the party has shifted its view of Russia. I mean, the House Republicans won't even take up a foreign aid bill that would help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. I mean, that's a big change. It is. It is the way that kind of the changes in the beliefs of the Republican electorate, what we call the base, is changing the leadership. Your article says that the party has become more populist in the last ten years. What does that mean? There's a few things that we see as kind of feeding into this populist sense. One of them is an anger about elites. And that's something that drives the skepticism about international trade, a feeling that it worked out well for corporate America. And for investors in top executives and big companies, and Neil may be not so well for people who are employed or were employed by those companies, we see it in a rising concern about immigration. That's something that definitely Trump has driven. The other thing that we see is in the skepticism about elections. Trump of course has since before his election defeat in 2020, been falsely claiming that the only way that he could lose would be the result of fraud. And that's proven very persuasive with Republican voters. This is perhaps a chicken and egg question. Did Trump make them party more populist or was this shift underway when he hit the scene? It's a self-reinforcing cycle. Trump did not create these ideas. He brought these voters in to the party. One of the things that he did was show that those people have the power to tip elections. And that's one of the reasons that this worldview is as influential as it is in Washington right now with Trump out of power. And probably the clearest kind of pre-Trump example of this rising energy was the Tea Party. Early in Barack Obama's first term as president, it was after the Great Recession, there was huge economic dislocation. People were seeing Washington bail out big companies. And it was a real sense that the little people were being lost. And that sort of rising energy gave way for Trump and for Maga and for the transformation that we've seen in the Republican Party. After Romney lost in 2012, there was talk of the GOP needing to reinvent itself. You know, they were reassessing, well, it wasn't wrong. And one idea was try to appeal to a new group of voters. You know, the phrase, a bigger tent was bandied about a lot. Is this what they had in mind back then? So it's interesting. At the time, after Romney's loss, there was a real sense that the party had been seen as exclusionary and that they did need to broaden their base. And what we've seen is they have broadened the base in a couple of ways. One of the ways that they've brought in the base is by bringing in more white non-college educated voters. But it should also be noted that they've brought in more non-college educated Hispanic voters. And that's a very important and growing piece of the US electorate. One group of voters that's still with Trump are evangelicals. They stuck with him in the past two elections, despite claims of adultery and charges of sexual abuse, which he has denied. And they're still with him for the 2024 election, despite the fact that he's now facing dozens of criminal charges and tried to overthrow an election. In fact, several voices in Christian media are taking the support even further. I think if they could kill a guy like Donald Trump, they would have. I don't think God is allowing them to do it. That's media personality and self-proclaimed profit, Lance Wal-Nau, on the Jim Baker show. They're trying to take everything he's got. They're trying to put him in prison, but he's still moving on because until his assignment is done, the hand of God is on him and he cannot be stopped. He and other Christian media personalities are increasingly portraying Trump as being chosen by God and depicting this election as a biblical war. Here's Tony Perkins on a show called Washington Watch with Tony Perkins. This is a battle between good and evil. It's much bigger than just the United States of America, quite frankly. This is what we read about in the New Testament about. Helen Costa covers politics and media. Helen, is this Messiah talk new? For a long time, Christian media has been a place where people could go and listen to content that was related to things like anti-abortion, anti-communism, other issues that are important to the conservative Christian community. What's new about this election cycle is that there's now content that's explicitly pro-Trump. Instead of just being about issues that are important to conservative Christians, now there's this unabashedly pro-Trump content, specifically along the lines of this messianic language that I've been talking about in the piece. That's according to experts I've spoken to who studied religion, politics, and media. I've listened to the clips that you sent along. The way they talk about Trump, it sort of goes beyond hero worship. Right. That's been bubbling around certain corners of the if and job community for a few years. It's really going steam and it's become more prominent as Trump is facing all these legal lows. And what's new is that they're now using that language to frame his legal lows as more of this battle for him and featuring him as being persecuted. They're also talking about him as being anointed by God in a way that would preserve him as he goes through these legal battles. Former frame you'll often hear from these TV sermons is that the acknowledged Trump is not a holy man. Here's Jim Baker. How can God give Trump the anointing? I believe he is called of God to be the president of the United States. Well, let's look at King David. King David was not, is Godly all the time. That's right. So how do they justify this staunch support? So this is something that's true, not just on Christian media, but in the evangelical community broadly. A lot of conservative evangelicals believe that Trump as a person is flawed. They don't disagree with that idea. But they support him because of his policies. And they think that he has done things that help the community and that support the views of the community, specifically adding judges to the Supreme Court so that in 2022, the court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. And additionally, movie, the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, which was also considered a policy win for folks in the conservatives evangelical community. How big is that community during the cycle, the evangelical vote? According to Pew Research, there are 80 million Americans and that's about a quarter of the population who described themselves as born again or evangelical Protestant. So it's enormous number. They have been key to Trump's rise and they are likely to play a big role in turnout and any chance that he has to win in a tight race against Joe Biden in November. Some of these personalities come off as a bit, friends, you know, they're selling meal plans for the apocalypse. How prominent are these media personalities? So the majority of media personalities I'm describing in this story are quite fringe. But they've amassed significant online followings and they appear on a lot of different shows. They have podcasts. So their messaging reverberates around the web and around the Christian media ecosystem. And it's particularly important because they're reaching voters on all different platforms as they drive to work, as they drop their kids off at school. And this is true across the US and also specifically in swing states. So this messaging is reaching voters who are really vital to the way that this election is going to go and who are key to voting in this race between Trump and Biden. The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for comment. But do we have any idea how he feels about all this? I mean, is he going along with this messaging? So Trump has really leaned into this method and in this battle. Because I'm being indicted for you and never forget our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. I'm never going to let it happen. For example, he gave a speech to the Association of Religious Broadcasters last month where he depicted his race in religious terms and compared it to some of the great battles of World War II. We have to bring back our religion. We have to bring back Christianity in this country. She's been starting some of his rallies with a video made by social media influencers. That includes some of that messianic language. And what it does is it helps to energize his base and hopefully gets them to turn out in big numbers in November. So we've talked quite a bit about Trump and his opponent, Joe Biden, but there is a third person in this race. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is running for president as an independent. And a recent Reuters poll finds that he has the support of 15% of registered voters. Now that's not the kind of number that gets you into the White House, but it is the kind of support that could alter the outcome of the selection. US elections reporter Stephanie Kelly recently sat down with the candidate at his Los Angeles home. Here he is. Twenty twenty four of the Democratic Party has radically changed. I don't think my father, my uncle, would have recognized it has become the party of war. That's 70 third party candidates are often referred to as spoilers. And so at this point, do we know who's campaign candidate is more likely to quote unquote spoil? I've spoken along with my colleague, Jared Renshaw to a dozen strategists on this and many are saying that third party candidates are likely to pull more voters from Biden than from Trump. That's because Biden has less of a loyal fan base than Trump. So voters could be more easily swayed from him. Of course, third party candidates can also pull from Trump, but his supporters are just more loyal. RFK has said some controversial things about vaccines in the past. Did you ask him about his anti vaccine stance? When I was speaking with him, he kept trying to push us away from labeling him as an anti-vaccine advocate. Of course, it's been well documented that he has been part of misinformation around vaccines, but he does seem to want to distance himself a little bit from that anti vaccine tag and just kind of relabel himself as pro science. Who is he appealing to? Well, his platform focuses on rain again, corporate power pulling back military spending and cheaper housing, but he's positioning himself as an outsider alternative to Trump and Biden. And as it's been reported again and again, both of those candidates are facing a lack of enthusiasm from voters about their candidacies in general. And I offer a clear alternative to the American people. And no doubt his views on vaccines are resonating with voters in both parties who share his skepticism. But Kennedy is also an environmentalist. Is he at all concerned that he might help elect somebody who doesn't believe in climate change? No, he's he did not seem concerned about being a potential quote unquote spoiler of the election. Again, I think that he wants voters to have another option and another person to vote for. I mean, that's the same argument that Ralph Nader had in 2000. And we know that his candidacy played a role in George W. Bush becoming president. And RFK is pulling in more support than Nader did. Yes. And the swing states in this election, they were all decided by less than 3% of the vote in the 2020 election. So if you have a candidate like RFK Jr., that's pulling X amount of votes in any of these states. It could potentially have a big impact on who ends up winning that state. You wrote about something fascinating that I had not considered. What happens if a third party candidate does well enough that no candidate reaches the 270 electoral votes needed to become president? Yeah, it's an interesting potential outcome. So there are scenarios. They're unlikely, but they are possible where if a candidate, a third party candidate, like Kennedy does well, he could stop Biden or Trump from reaching the necessary 270 electoral votes to become president. And then nobody wins the election. And at that point, the decision would go to the newly elected House of Representatives. Right now the House is run by Republicans, but we don't know who is going to run it after the election. It's more than likely that Trump would still end up being elected president by a new house based on how state delegations are made up right now. Even more fascinating in this scenario is that the vice president would be elected through the Senate. It's also unclear who would control the Senate after the election, but there is a potential scenario where we would wind up having a president and a vice president from two different political parties. That would be quite a ticket. Yeah, I think that we would be in for a very confusing four years if that were the case.

With Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene filing a motion to vacate the chair, seeking to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson. Instead of being able to persuade others to come along with their ideas and their goals in Congress, they just try to extort the speaker. I'm Chris Foster. You can't control the weather, then that's contributing to the high costs of home insurance premiums, especially in disaster-prone states like Florida. It's really something that a lot of Florida residents are dealing with, and it's increasing the cost of housing, making affordability that much more an issue, which, as we all know, is already a huge issue across the country. And I'm Janice Dean. At the end of last week, Russia was hit by a deadly terror attack, killing more than 100 people. ISIS K has claimed responsibility. And some, like Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton or warning, its next target could be American interests. It's deeply regrettable that innocent civilians, women and children were killed in Moscow, but the next attacks could be against an American embassy in Asia or in Europe or against, say, students traveling to Europe on a school trip for spring break. Virginia Democrats, Senator Tim Key notes the United States try to help Russia by warning that an attack was coming. If you want to know the difference between democracies and authoritarians, we will tell nations if we're worried about their civilians. Russia or Iran would never tell us if they had news that there was going to be a terrorist attack in the United States. The House Republican Slim majority is shrinking. Wisconsin Republican Congressman Mike Gallagher says he's leaving Congress April 19th. Lawmakers avoided a partial government shutdown this weekend, but drama didn't end there. Georgia Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green filed a resolution to vacate the speaker's chair. Again, I don't have a timeline. That will be a rolling issue that will be judging and making decisions by, but I assure you, I'm not the only one I have support on this from others in my conference. And it's not I'm not introducing this to throw the House into chaos. Committees will continue doing their work. Investigations will continue. If that sounds familiar, it's because similar tactics were used to remove then-house speaker Kevin McCarthy last October. Congresswoman Green is taking some heat. Oklahoma Senator Mark Wayne Mullin says it's a lousy idea. I think this is a huge mistake. I believe this causes dysfunction in the House when it shouldn't be there. Speaker Johnson is doing the best they could. The move comes at a pivotal time with voters assessing the strength of Republican leadership heading into the 2024 election. I'm against it. This is not helpful at all in any way, shape or form. We're at a bad state right now. Ohio Republican Congressman Brad Wenstrip is chairman of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus pandemic where people instead of being able to persuade others to come along with their ideas and their goals in Congress, they just try to extort the speaker. And she's not the first obviously. And we saw the ousting of Kevin McCarthy. So we're in a challenging time if this is going to be the way that people want to operate. You know, normally you come to Congress, you want to be persuasive. There's things you're working towards. If you don't get it all the first time, you try again. If you get 80% of it, you might take it and then keep working on the other 20. No one likes this appropriations process coming into these mini buses or large omnibus bills. Nobody likes that. And so we have got to stop taking down our own bills and voting against the rule on appropriations bills that are conservative and they're coming out of committee. And Kevin McCarthy tried to put people together that are from the two ends of the Republican party and on the committee so that when they produce a product, you know, we can all go for it, stand behind it. And when you do these things, it weakens the speaker's hand. I don't like that it comes down to the speaker. I like better when we pass things out of committee, pass them on the floor and then go to conference with the Senate. But the bottom line is people have to understand that the American government is right now for dimensional. You've got the house, you've got the Senate, you have the White House, and you have our agencies that we deal with all the time that are regulating things and putting things out there that we try to pass bills to stop them. And I don't think that's what our founders had in mind. So I'm hoping with this bill being passed and on its way that we can then get into 2025 and do the appropriations process appropriately. And get things done on behalf of the American people. What I am against is the shutdown. I was here in 2013. I stood by the shutdown and we pay to have the price for it. Congressman, you have some legislative proposals yourself, one being the Educate Act, which is seeking to end diversity, equity, and inclusion teachings in medical schools. Tell us about that proposal and what you hope it can achieve. Well, as you probably know, we have a Drs. Caucus in Congress, and I'm one of the co-chairs along with Dr. Greg Murphy. And we put this forward because we see what's taking place in our alma materers in our medical schools. And we're moving people along that don't necessarily have the credentials that we normally expect of someone who gets their medical license. And so you would always get there based on your merit. You certainly want to provide opportunities for people that normally wouldn't have them to get into school and to be prepared to get into school. But this is not good for the trust if the American people will want to have in their physicians going forward. You're going to have people questioning whether the person in front of them actually really progressed and is qualified for what they are doing because these people are being put into a position where they normally might fail, but they're being coddled and you're changing things from graded to pass fail. And it's a real danger. Not only that, it's the same in residency programs as well. It needs to be based on merit. We fought for 60 years or more in this country to make sure that we were providing equal opportunity for people and that there was no discrimination. DEI is exactly the opposite of that. And it's dangerous when it comes to your healthcare. And this is not the place you can be doing this. We don't do it in sports, do we? You have to be there based on your merit. And that's sports. Here we're talking about people's lives. Another bill you've brought forward and that a bipartisan group in Congress is urging President Biden to implement is the No Surprises Act. How would this bill help the American people? Well, the No Surprises Act was actually written very well in a way that can help the American people tremendously. What happens a lot of times with patients is that they go to the hospital in an emergency situation, maybe even the hospital is in their network, but this is an emergency surgery, for example. And the doctor that was on call to operate on you is not in network. So you would get this large bill that was a unnegotiated rate because they were out of network. Well, what we wanted to do is remove the anxiety from patients and create a situation where doctors would want to be in network and providers of insurance providers would want to get you in network. So we take patients out of it. We have a 30-day period where the doctor and the insurance company could come to an agreement and if they don't, there's an arbitration process. The arbitration process we wrote up was very fair. So it would not give a tip of hand to one side or the other. And we wanted to make sure that there was no benchmark like a median in network rate because the insurance companies can control that. They can remove their high-end providers and drive that down. So we passed a bill that didn't allow that. We made it very clear bipartisan fashion out of Ways and Means Committee across the board signed by President Trump and put in place to really help patients through tough times and do something fair for the providers that take call and see patients in these situations. And unfortunately, HHS came out with their ruling and basically said, you can use that as a benchmark and that has thrown the whole system into flux. There's a huge back, back log on arbitration. We were trying to get to a position where you avoid arbitration. Hey, and we're trying to fix that. Just as past Friday, Congressman Russia was hit by a deadly terror attack that left more than 100 people dead. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack. What do you make of the situation in the fact that the United States warned Russia? Well, you know, that is something that the United States has been doing. If we pick up some intelligence that especially are going to harm innocent people in almost any country in the world, we do want to let them know. And so we let them know and still this happened. And it surprises me that this could happen in a communist country like Russia, almost said so, the union, sorry. Like Russia. Where they have a pretty good idea who everybody is and coming in and out of their country as opposed to our country right now, unfortunately. But and then this is ISIS K that is claiming responsibility. This is the same group that launched the attack on the United States when we were leaving Afghanistan. And now you've seen all this posturing. One group is claiming that they did it. And then you have others saying that this was, the Russians are saying this was Ukrainian. I can understand why they want to say that to inspire their people to be more angry at the Ukrainians and to try and legitimize it. I guess it's work in or that war in Ukraine. And I don't think you can legitimize it very well. That's maybe what they're trying to do. And then there's also some that are saying you blame the special forces of Putin. So the accusations are flying across the board. And I think time will tell exactly who did this. But it's always sad when something like this happens. The terrorists attack is a terrorist attack and they usually occur on innocent people that don't have anything to do with the actions of the government. Congressman, you leave the House select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic. What do you believe your subcommittee has accomplished in when can we expect potentially more public hearings? Yeah, so we are heading into the phase of having more public hearings actually because we've had transcribed interviews with Dr. Ralph Barrett, renowned coronavirus neurologist associated with gain of function research. We've had Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins, Dr. Dazek, who's head of eco-health alliance who was doing gain of function research on American tax dollars in Wuhan, China. And so next we'll be bringing some of these people forward for open hearings. And as we do that, we'll also be releasing the finally approved transcriptions from the interviews that we've had with them. Look, there is so much for the American people to take in with this. One, why are we even doing gain of function research? And that's where I am right now because I believe you want to try and do it to predict the next pandemic. You can probably do that through AI and not actually create a more infectious virus. There was so much obfuscation by China. It's certainly a cover up. They sent me a letter right away saying it's a grave mistake for me to even proceed with this process. And we know what kind of programs they have in Wuhan and their bio weapons program is certainly a part of it. They've written about it. So a lot of things pointing to something going awry in China for sure. We may never have all the answers because they're not cooperating. And that's a problem. But in our interview with Dr. Fauci, he never looked at those talking about how it could have come from the lab, never looked at that science. And in our interview, I suggested he might want to look at that. But he did say during his hearing now that it's not a conspiracy theory to say it came from the lab. But what did we endure for well over a year, two years that anybody who said something like that, they were being disregarded and canceled, et cetera. So we've made a lot of gains in the things that people probably want to know about. And as you look at the agencies now, when it comes to origins of COVID, the DOE, FBI, CIA, ODNI, they all lean towards lab leak theory.

And in Florida, Santa Signed bills in December to create a re-insurance fund to stabilize the market and to rewrite rules on things like coverage denials and attorney fees. We have about 8% of the insurance claims for homeowners nationwide. The state represents 78% of all the litigation. Higher insurance costs are making it harder for people in Florida to afford to stay in their homes and harder for them to sell because buyers are discouraged by the high cost of premiums. This is a recurrent issue in Florida where the average insurance premium homeowner is dealing with about 6,000 annually is what it is on average and some people are paying a lot more. I myself am paying a lot more. I can attest to that. This figure surpasses the national average by more than triple. And Marx, a threshold increase compared to Floridians' average insurance cost in 2018. Adding to the strength several major insurance carriers have departed the state over the past year, leaving residents with limited alternatives and they don't have options. There's three primary factors that have been contributing to the insurance challenge. First, natural disasters are becoming more frequent and costly. Secondly, the cost of re-insurance is skyrocketing. And lastly, Florida's litigation friendly environment exacerbates the issue by facilitating easy lawsuits against insurers. Florida has experienced an average of $4 billion disaster annually over the past five years. So consequently, insurers struggle to turn a profit or secure re-insurance to safeguard their stakeholders, which brings me to the importance of re-insurance. So insurance companies generate revenue through risk pulling among policyholders and risk reduction via re-insurance. Re-insurance serves as a safety net for insurers providing financial protection against these events. And all of these natural disasters has created a burden to policyholders. So to navigate these challenges, some companies have opted to limit coverage for specific damages, while others have withdrawn entirely from the state. The insurance companies have people whose job is to look at this stuff and look at algorithms and math it out. And if you look at XYZ and determine race-based, you know, property values, prevalence of claims, rebuilding costs, and they want to keep profits the same, what's the solution? Well, you know, Florida has responded proactively to the property insurance crisis by passing Senate Bill 2A in December 2022, which is a comprehensive package of insurance reforms. One significant aspect of this litigation is a rule change aimed at discouraging policyholders from litigating against insurers to recover attorney fees. However, you know, if some of these measures are really debated with concerns over access to justice and escalating litigation costs. So the bill restricts the assignment of benefits, a mechanism enabling third party entities to negotiate with insurers on behalf of residents. Now, while this mechanism has enhanced the advocacy, it's also contributed to rising claim costs. So Florida's, you know, it's actions to address the policy insurance crisis raise a critical question, which is, will the state serve as a model for disaster-prone regions or serve as a cautionary tale? Like states like California, Louisiana facing similar challenges may draw inspiration from Florida's response and that response is still in the process. It's really something that a lot of Florida residents are dealing with and it's increasing the cost of housing, making affordability that much more an issue, which as we all know, is already a huge issue across the country. So it'll be interesting to see what actually transpires. And I know so many people personally dealing with this issue where they can't get insurance. And I have been heard of, you know, a remedy per se that has been successful yet. So it's Florida's legislative response reflects our ongoing effort to strike a balance between providing the opportunities and containing the costs, ensuring fairness and accessibility for insurers and policy holders alike. Yeah, I imagine that people with very expensive properties have a hard time getting those insured for their true value. And then on the other end, like you said, you're in a fixed income or you've even paid off your home or you buy a home, figuring, okay, I can swing this. This is my mortgage. This is my insurance. These are my taxes. I know the taxes are going to go up a little bit, but otherwise I think I got this. And then suddenly, bam, you're hit with thousands of dollars more that you just can't afford. Absolutely. And it's really so sad because Florida used to be the state that again, some people came and retired to or it was affordable and inflation in Miami where I'm from is leading the nation. So we were leading the nation in home prices, right? And now we're leading the nation in inflation, you know, and campus right behind that and just Florida in general and then property taxes now and insurance costs are really creating a really bad scenario for a lot of people, you know, in the economy, obviously, in its current state is not helping. Part of the problem here is reinsurance. Talk about how that works and how there may be a legislative fix for it. Are insurance companies legally required to have too much backup? Well, as I mentioned, you know, reinsurance kind of helps these insurance companies be covered, right, with risk. And they're having a difficult time. It's like a homeowner can't get insurance. Now the insurance companies are having difficulties getting reinsurance. So then that becomes an issue. So a lot of insurance companies are just dropping people all together. And so there's so many different factors that are going into the insurance issues right now. It's not just about the natural disaster. So as far as the, as you mentioned, the reinsurance. A lot of people aren't aware that insurance companies generate revenue through risk pooling amongst like the policyholders and the risk reduction via the reinsurance and reinsurance serves as a safety net. Or insurers and it provides them with financial protection against these events. So the surge in climate related disasters has led reinsurers to also hike their premiums, compelling insurers to pass on that burden to policyholders. So it's like a domino effect, if you will. You know, the insurance companies are going to pass those costs on to the homeowners. But such thing is the national flood insurance program. Might this be a situation where the federal government at some point, if you still want people to live in Florida and Louisiana and and in Southern California, might this be a situation where the federal government has to step in and subsidize or nationalize disaster insurance. Something's got to change. And I think you're absolutely right. Like citizens insurance, you know, sometimes if you can't get that's an example. If you can't get insured, then ultimately your backup is citizens insurance, which is not, you know, sometimes it's more expensive. Sometimes it covers less. So I do think that the government is going to have to get involved if this continues to happen. Because what else is the alternative? Yeah. A couple of just fun issues for let you go. I plan on winning one of these big lottery prizes in the next couple days. I've got it. I've got it booked. I want to spend say $100 million in cash on a property. Where should I spend it? What should I get? We just in one property or you can diversify. Um, you can talk me into it. I want to, but I want them to be really, really lavish, crazy over the top. Well, see, I'm all about once you have that kind of money, like enjoy, enjoy quality flight, right? And have diversification. I wouldn't put it all in one property. So I would buy a property in Florida with that much money you could afford insurance cost, right? Or you just take a chance and don't get it insured and pay cash. Um, I love Tennessee. Tennessee is one of the markets that I absolutely love. Ohio has become so popular recently because the cost there is so low and you could get so much for your money and the weather is amazing. Um, in the summertime, you know, obviously you have the winners, but I would diversify and I love Montana. That's another market. You know, having filmed, mentioned global all across the nation, the markets that really stick out to me are like Montana Jackson Hole, Tennessee, Florida. People are relocating to Oklahoma, believe it or not. So you can get a lot of land there. So I would diversify so that you can jump around money with that much money. You can enjoy all these different lifestyles, right? And I have to worry. Okay. So by a half a dozen houses or maybe a couple plots of land and then that can be my architecture fund building project there. Um, finally, a lot of people like to window shop on the sites like Zillow. Um, it's fun. Are those values based on anything in reality or is it, um, is it just for fun? I wouldn't take Zillow values very seriously. I think there are more approximate, if you will, than actually accurate. Um, the only way to really determine what your properties worth is to have a human actually do a comparable market analysis. Well, I'll still going to look in flip through the pictures though. You can still look and have some fun and, you know, but they're not 100% accurate. Thanks a lot. Good talk to you. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Here's a look at the week ahead Tuesday. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on the abortion pill. Mythopristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000 and needed to be prescribed in person over three doctors visits since then prescriptions can now occur through telemedicine and the drug delivered by mail. The group suing argues the FDA exceeded their authority by making it more easily available. Thursday, the former head of cryptocurrency exchange FTX will be sentenced. Sam Bankman Fried was convicted on fraud and conspiracy charges accused of running a Ponzi scheme that stole more than $10 billion from customers, lenders and investors. Also on Thursday, it's MLB opening day, with all 30 teams slated to play. Friday, Beyonce releases her first ever country album, Cowboy Carter. The album singles have already put Queen Bay in the record books, making her the first black woman to reach the top of the Billboard country charts. And that's a look at your week ahead. For too often, women's lives are cut short as they fall victim to unthinkable crimes, but each week this month I'll be joined by women who fought back, survived and took back control. You won't want to miss this month's stories of survival, strength and resilience. Janice Dean. What's on your mind? A few weeks ago, the House Select Subcommittee investigating the coronavirus pandemic issued a subpoena for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo to appear for questioning over his failure to cooperate with a probe into New York state's COVID-19 nursing home policies. As many of you know, I have been fighting for four years when it comes to truth and accountability into the deadly decisions that I believe helped kill thousands of seniors in New York in the spring of 2020, including my husband's parents. March 25th is the fourth anniversary of the must admit directive for nursing homes to accept COVID positive patients. It was issued by the Cuomo administration and the New York State Health Department. That executive order was in place for 46 days in which time over 9,000 sick patients were brought into the homes of where are most vulnerable resided. The former governor has never formally been questioned as to why he signed this order that defies all science and despite all the dire warnings that were issued by experts and even Cuomo himself in the spring of 2020. A subpoena is a start to try to find the truth and I look forward to hearing him finally go on the record. But there also has to be a thorough after-action review here in New York to make sure this category five disaster never happens again. So far, the only state to release an independent report is New Jersey, conducted by former assistant state attorney general Paul Zubeck. Like New York, New Jersey also had a similar executive order admitting people who were diagnosed with COVID-19. The report found that these homes, including those that were veterans facilities, were a, quote, profile in incompetence that allowed the virus to spread uncontrollably in the earliest days of the pandemic and kill at least 200 residents. Our current governor, Kathy Hocal, who was Andrew Cuomo's lieutenant governor at the time, told families, including mine, in a closed-door meeting that she wanted to get to the bottom of what happened to our loved ones. And although there have been several reports issued by the attorney general and the comptroller here in New York, a few hearings and bill proposals too, we have not seen anything in the way of a thorough top to bottom investigation for one of the worst hit states in the country. Meanwhile, our former disgrace governor has been on a media tour, criticizing people in his own party for enforcing laws and decisions he made while in office. He's been appearing on local radio stations, writing newspaper editorials and doing television interviews about congestion pricing here in New York, the influx of migrants, homelessness, unemployment and high taxes. The fact that media outlets are helping to rehabilitate his career without challenging him once again is infuriating. It's important, on March 25, the anniversary of what I believe was a death warrant to thousands of elderly to remember and remind people of what happened to our loved ones. It was avoidable. And the fact that Andrew Cuomo continues to have a platform without being questioned about the catastrophic decisions that were made during the COVID pandemic is one of the biggest reasons I've been so loud and persistent. And the fact that four years later, there is still no justice or accountability for their deaths. And although the headlines have died down about what happened during COVID four years ago, and many choose to forget the incredible danger our relatives faced because of those decisions, I will never give up, no matter how long it takes. Because it's up to us, the living, to seek justice for our family members who died, and whose memories will always be a blessing.\",\" I'm Greg Jarrett. I'm Sandra Smith. Wednesday, March 13th, 2024, I'm Jessica Rosenthal. Neither side of the political aisle was thrilled with the special counsel who decided against charging the president in his own classified documents case. Robert Her appeared before Congress. So listen to Her and listen to the Democrats. You would think that anyone who cooperates doesn't get charged and like that's never how it works. I'm Dave Anthony. Boeing has even more questions to answer about manufacturing and air plane safety. It's a giant issue for aviation right now. Remember these failed audits also reflect on the FAA. And I'm former vice president Mike Pence. Special counsel Robert Her said even if there weren't a policy against charging sitting presidents, he still would not have charged President Biden. That even if his investigation found the president willfully retain classified documents, he doubted they could prove that to a jury. In his report, Robert Her wrote that the president comes across as a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. But to the House Judiciary Committee, he said, The need to show my work was especially strong here. The Attorney General had appointed me to investigate the actions of the Attorney General's boss, the sitting president of the United States. I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why. Democrats like California Congressman Ted Lu noted that Her's own report compared President Biden's document case to former President Trump's. Did you find that President Biden direct his lawyer to destroy classified documents? So did you find that President Biden directed his personal assistant to move boxes of documents to hide them from the FBI? No. Just a couple of things, former President Trump is accused of doing. Ranking member Marilyn Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin addressed the portion of Her's assessment that the president came across as an older man with a poor memory who couldn't recall specific dates. Who's soaring oratory, powerful historical analysis, and devastating extemporaneous rep partay with even the most skilled ninja hecklers of the Freedom Caucus were on full display at the State of the Union address last week for the whole country to see. But some Republicans like California Congressman Tom McClintock expressed concerns again of a double standard. But the fact that the only person being prosecuted for this offense happens to be the president's political opponent makes this an unprecedented assault on our democracy. At one point, a Democratic congresswoman insisted that what Her's report did was exonerate President Biden. Her said that's not what he did. At another point, a Democratic congressman tried to get her to pledge that he wouldn't take a position as judge if former President Trump wins in November. Trump initially appointed her as US Attorney. But her was appointed special counsel in this matter by Attorney General Merrick Garland. He was a very good witness and he understood that he was there to testify about his report. He resisted any temptation to do anything else. I think the two takeaways I have are really what I thought going in and I'm just more confirmed in it. One is the case for not charging Biden when Trump has been charged and that's an inevitable comparison. It's the reason why he addressed it in his report. But the case for that is very weak because as you saw with her, Biden has a 40 year history of pilfering classified information and illegally retaining it. What her would do is go through each individual instance and come up with reasons why a jury might not think that Biden should be convicted on the basis of this or that instance. The way trials work is actually the opposite of that. Defense lawyers do try to parse events. But what judges tell juries at the end decide from the fact that they shouldn't check their common sense at the door when they walk in the courtroom is that you look at evidence and pieces of evidence in conjunction, not in isolation. And what you get when you look at this in conjunction is a 40 year pattern of intentionally, willfully retaining illegally classified documents. And I thought it was very telling on that score that her was asked what could a rational juror convict Biden? And he answered, yes, a rational juror could. The reason that's important is on appeal when somebody gets convicted, the standard in federal law is whether a rational juror could have found guilty on the reasonable doubt based on the evidence that was presented. So even the special counsel who decided not to charge is admitting that there's a prosecutable case there that a rational juror could convict on. And I think the second point is this is why he has to keep falling back on the one distinction between the Biden case and the Trump case, which is that Biden cooperated with the investigation and Trump allegedly obstructed it. But that's a reason to prosecute Trump for obstruction. So special counsel, her rights and the report and he's questioned about this by Republicans about that there's insufficient evidence to move forward with the prosecution against President Biden. And her reference is that he's making this decision in accordance with the justice manual that they have to decline prosecution. What is the reference to the justice manual? He almost sounded like he was putting the burden on the Department of Justice protocol. The thing is that the Justice Department's principles of federal prosecution are so broadly stated that he could just as easily have said we decided to bring charges because it was consistent with the principles of federal prosecution. The fact of the matter is some cases are what you call gray area cases. I must say listening to his testimony throughout the day, this didn't seem like much of a gray area to me. It seemed to me like there's an overwhelming case for charging. In fact, I think the one reason I could think of for not charging, which is one that he's not really allowed to say, is that we're talking about a Washington DC jury, which is lean heavily toward Democrats and might equate them even if he was guilty. That's like the dirty little secret everyone knows, but it would have been inappropriate for him to say that, but don't think they want to think it. But Andy, in this case, the president, you don't charge a sitting president, right? And he said, even, yeah, go ahead. I was going to say, functionally, you're entirely right technically, the Justice Department guidance says you can't, or you can't indict a sitting president. Functionally, what he means is, you know, recommend charges as opposed to file charges. We could get into this if you want. I've always thought that that rule that you can indict a sitting president is wrong. I think that you should be able to indict a sitting president and keep it under seal until he's out of office. And the reason I say that is the rule is not intended to give the president a leg up that the normal person wouldn't have. But if they follow it to a letter like that, then the statute of limitations could run by the time the guy got out of office and you'd never be able to charge him. So that's never made any sense to me either. Some Democrats said that he trashed President Biden and mocked him by mentioning his age or that he came across as seemingly old and with a poor memory. But that did not seem to be the big focus of Democrats. It seemed that the Democrats really wanted to focus on comparing this case to former President Trump, insisting that these two cases really aren't comparable. But it seemed that the Democrats largely stayed away from talking about that characterization of the president. Yeah. See, the thing is, what is the old Mike Tyson line that like everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the mouth? The thing is, you can have a plan when you go into a hearing and say, this is what we're going to exploit, right? And then you run into a witness like her. And I think that the one thing that we can conclusively say after five hours of watching him testify is he seems to be a straight arrow and a gentleman and it's like inconceivable to think that he would be there gratuitously poking fun at Biden. So once it's clear that that's the kind of a witness that you're dealing with, if you try to run that story when it like obviously doesn't make sense given the witness that you're dealing with, you're going to make a fool out of yourself. And I think that they realized early on that line of argument was not going to get traction with this particular witness who just doesn't seem like the time to be gratuitously making fun of people. And then the other unfortunate thing for Democrats, facts can be very unfortunate. But they put out the transcript of Biden's interview by her right before the hearing. And they obviously did it right before the hearing because they didn't want to give the Republicans time to prepare because it's a gold mine for them. But it made it very obvious that a lot of the things that Biden accused her of weren't true. You know, like her didn't bring up Bow Biden. It was Biden who brought it up. You know, her was utterly respectful to Biden during the course of the interview. You weren't going to get any place by suggesting that this guy was a gratuitously nasty partisan kind of guy. He's just not. I mean, clearly the most damning thing about about the case against President Biden was that his own speechwriter has him on tape saying, quote, I found all the classified stuff downstairs, meaning in his own garage in Delaware. And about that, her rights the following Mr. Biden's memory was significantly limited both during his recorded interviews with the ghostwriter in 2017 and in his interview with our office in 2023. And his cooperation with our investigation included, including by reporting to the government that the Afghanistan documents were in his Delaware garage will likely convince some jurors that he made an innocent mistake rather than acting willfully that is with intent to break the law as the statute requires. Yeah, I just think that's the first. That seems to be the crux of the, that seems to be like the crux of everything to me. But my question for you about that is if it was so not willful, then in 2017, wouldn't President Biden then have called his personal attorney and the national archives if he was being so cooperative? Yeah, well, that's exactly right. I mean, that is an over interpretation of events in Biden's favor. And it conflates two things that are very importantly different and that have been consistently conflated in all of the commentary about this. There's a huge difference between a person's state of mind in the here and now versus the person's state of mind when he did the actions that allegedly violated the law. So for example, if Biden took a document in 1983 when he was in the Senate and then retained it and knew he had retained it, the fact that he's close to non-composmentos in 2024 is irrelevant to what his state of mind was when he committed the offense. But when you're talking about is he guilty or not guilty of the offenses, what matters is his state of mind at the time he did the acts that he's accused of, not what his state of mind is now. So I thought this was the worst and weakest part of hers testimony because regardless of what you think about how forgetful he's become and that he's, you know, senescent or however you want to put it in the here and now, that really doesn't help him with respect to stuff that he might have taken in 2005 and 1997 or 1983 when he was, you know, a very different person at least psychologically. He's obviously deteriorated as he's gotten older and as we've all seen, it's really not a defense of him that he, you know, that now he's forgetful. And that's the reason, and I think her is this morning of God to know that that reasoning just doesn't hold up. So as a result, their fallback keeps being that he, that Biden cooperated with their investigation and Trump didn't. And, you know, to listen to her and listen to the Democrats, you would think that anyone who cooperates doesn't get charged and like that's never how it works. And, Demacarthi, thank you so much for your insight, expertise and time. We really appreciate it. Thanks so much. Hey there, it's me, Kennedy. Make sure to check out my podcast. Kennedy saves the world. It is five days a week every week. The summer of 1997 brought warm weather and good energy to the University of Kentucky campus. One August night, Holly Dunn and her boyfriend left a fraternity party to walk along the railroad tracks. Little did they know of the serial murderer who lurked in the shadows. It has been a turbulent time for Boeing. You don't have any words of assurance for customers who were too scared to fly on a Boeing plane. We believe in our airplanes. But the jet did land safely. The incident, however, temporarily grounded the whole fleet of Boeing 737 Max 9s and inspections found some other issues until the government cleared those jets for take off again. Well, now the Department of Justice has opened a criminal inquiry. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says Boeing should fully collaborate with any entity, NTSP, us or DOJ, and they should and we expect them to. There have been other recent incidents, also under scrutiny. They had a drawlux issue on a flight last week that after a tire fell off a plane right of a departure. On top of all that, the FAA reports Boeing failed 33 of 89 audits. As it scrutinizes Boeing's manufacturing process, adding to the intrigue of former Boeing Quality Control Engineer turned whistleblower was found dead and was being investigated as a suicide in South Carolina. John Barnett had raised issues of rushed production, compromising safety. It's a giant issue for aviation right now. Remember these failed audits also reflect on the FAA. Michael Boyd is president of his own aviation consulting business, Boyd Group International. So we have to look at what was the system at Boeing and what was the system at the FAA that allowed these things to take place. And that's going to be a big thing to dive into. So when they're doing these audits, are they looking at the manufacturing process step by step? I would suspect they're looking at every part of it. I mean, the real red flag here is they can't tell you who really worked on that door plug at an airline. This is the same thing. The mechanic doesn't work and there's an inspector. Apparently, we had a whistleblower as inspectors weren't doing that work. That's severe. And I think it goes to question whether or not Boeing is doing the whole thing right, not just a door plug. And it's not just Boeing. Obviously, Boeing has suppliers. One of them is spirit aerosystems and it also failed in different quality control audits done by the FAA. Spirit makes the fuselage of the body for that 737 max jet. That was the max nine that was involved in the Alaska issue back in January. So spirit is also dealing with this issue. Absolutely. I think all of Boeing's main suppliers are going to get dragged into this and they should. You know, spirit keep in mind, you know, up until about 20 years ago, they were Boeing aircraft, Boeing just sold that factory off into an independent company. They have to be monitored as well. So again, when these inspections are failed, it's not a minor thing. It reflects a on Boeing big time and what Boeing's been doing over the last several years, but it also reflects on FAA oversight that FAA should have been on top of some of this stuff. They can't sit there and say, oh, we just found it. So again, the good news is when this is settled, Boeing's going to be a whole lot better. The FAA is going to be a whole lot better than the public's going to be a whole lot safer. Now when that issue happened in January, the 737 Max 9 was grounded for a period of time. There were inspections. There were some other issues found. It's flying again. Do you believe that that aircraft and all other Boeing aircraft in service are safe? I do. I'll tell you how I monitor that. We do a lot of work with pilot unions. If those pilots in America or Southwest or United get into the cockpit and they say they're going to fly it, I'll get into a coach seat and fly with them. Okay. Because we had them grounded in 2019 also because of two crashes overseas, but that's not related to any of this, right? It may be related. In the sense that it was a Boeing screw up that allowed this to happen. That door plug was a Boeing screw up that allowed this to happen. These failures at the FAA are Boeing screw ups. So I wouldn't rule out that the causal factors of what happened in 2019 are not involved today. Of course, when you have such scrutiny, every incident becomes a news story. Any issue on a flight and we had one earlier in the week that Latin airlines, I don't know if that's how I say it, right? That had a flight going from Australia to New Zealand. It had a strong shake, some sort of a technical issue. The plane drops. People hit their heads and the ceiling and their seats and they had more than 50 people injured and a dozen people went to the hospital. Is that something that could be Boeing related? Do you think it's an airline issue? Could it be an air pocket? What are we talking about? Well, what we started out here talking about is the manufacturing and production process at Boeing. Now, an airplane has been flying for 10 years and has a problem in the sky. That's not a manufacturing process, probably. Okay. Because apparently the pilot on that flight had said there was equipment failure for a few seconds and the plane dropped for, you know, significantly, it was 500 feet in that short amount of time. Equipment failure, you sure that doesn't go back to manufacturing or is it 10 years at the maintenance issue? It could be both. There's no question about it. Keep in mind, I think there were, like, it's some numbers. It was like 150,000 operations of the Boeing 737 maps before we had this two accidents. So yeah, something could come up. I mean, flaws come up in airplanes years after they're built. So you're entirely accurate and saying, maybe that could be part of this too. Okay. There was a Boeing 787 Dreamliner 9, a different Boeing aircraft. The Dreamliners are, they haven't had the same scrutiny as the 737 Max. Am I correct? Oh, no, they had a lot of scrutiny. Okay. I wrong. His whistleblower was talking about it. Keep in mind when they were built, we had a major problems. If you remember, it goes back, it's off. Fuzzy, but it goes back to, uh, fasteners not being done right there. The delivery airplane. It was the issue of battery power. Keep, keep them on these airplanes are lighter. There's no hydraulics. Everything's electronic. And if you remember, there was a big issue with battery fires, uh, on these airplanes. So again, it's a new airplane. And virtually every new airplane has had some problems like this. The ripple effect for the airlines themselves. If Boeing's manufacturing is under scrutiny and there's a production delay issue, that is going to affect airlines. We've heard already from Alaska and Southwest. They're not sure about their guidance for the year, Fiskily United has even paused some pilot hiring because of this. How much worse could it get for the airlines? It could get a lot worse. Keep my United, which is a superbly managed entity. They're going to be down about 100 airplanes by the end of the summer from what they had planned. 100 airplanes. That's a lot of flying. That's a lot of money. Uh, there's a lot of overhead that was included in that. Those plans and the airplanes won't be better produced revenue. It's major there. There's no question about it. It's take a look. We have other issues for two. I mean, the spread airlines has issues because the engines on those airplanes were, I would say defective. They need to be modified and that's hurting them. So all these things heard an airline that the bottom end of it, it hurts a consumer. You mentioned spirit airlines earlier. Jet blue was going to merge with spirit. Federal judge blocked it. It was concerns about what it would mean to the industry. And now those two have gone their separate ways. They still compete. They're not going to be one airline after all. Good or bad in your opinion that that deal is not happening. But after the consumer because it wasn't a merger, jet blue was going to buy spirit and with spirit, they got a couple hundred airplanes and a couple hundred pilots immediately where they could expand. The judge was very wrong to say it would do away with one major competitor to keep in mind. There are two different types of airlines. Spirit is an impulse airline. People see a fear and they go. It would have made jet blue a much stronger competitor to the other, the big four Southwest United Delta and America. All right. We're talking about safety and issues on flights here and flights there. But big picture. Just the other day you did have the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, say American aviation is the safest means of travel in the world. We had crashes. I remember as a kid in the 70s and then in the 80s, there were crashes in the news all the time. We haven't had that knock on wood in the US much at all. Yeah. And a lot of that goes to the crews of the airplanes. If it's an American, the US airline I'll get on it any day of the week because the people involved in flying it, cabin safety, which we call flight attendance and people who are fixing it. These are professionals all the way across. So again, keep in mind when that flight gets delayed or gets canceled due to maintenance issue, that's a safety improvement if you want to call it that. And he's right. When you look at numbers, the number of people flying, it's all safer than getting on interstate 70 and trying to drive to California. Yeah. I saw a statistic. The chances of a passenger being killed on a flight anywhere in the world, one in 13.4 million. 1968 to 77. The chance was one in 350,000. That's a big improvement in safety. Well, it's huge. It's global too because you know, back in the, I don't know, I don't know how to make it too much in it, but you get back in the 1970s and age when we had a lot of commuter carriers, some of those were, you know, flying on the edge, if you will, they're gone now. As Boeing goes through all these issues and audits and scrutiny, what does it mean for a competitor like an Airbus? Because Boeing is Boeing's own future at stake here. It is. You know, you don't add capacity when a competitor has a short-term problem, but these are the 737-10 issue and some others. It's going to shove about 300 to 350, maybe more airplanes off the Boeing book into potentially the Airbus book. Airbus has the ability now. They have 78 for say you get down a mobile all-bamba with a factor. They can expand that to another two production lines and basically take those 737-10 order and convert them to A321-XLR, which is a wonderful airplane. So Airbus is in the cat bird's shape right now and they have the ability to expand to this loss of craft, loss of business from Boeing. So Airbus is in a pretty good position right now. How are they when it comes to safety audits and scrutiny? Don't know. I haven't seen anything, but we've seen nothing along the lines of what we've seen at Boeing where we do know we've had bolts not installed, where we do know we had bad or I say questionable engineering when the max came out. We don't have any of those indications at all, but keep in mind they have a US factory down in mobile and it has oversight from the FAA too and we have a bird, not a thing. Some people say they're looking when they're booking a flight, what kind of airplane that flight is and they may not take one based on what it is if it's a Boeing plane. They'll try to find another alternative. Is that smart or is it too overreactive? It's too overreacting. I mean, you want to go back to very ancient history. Sixty years ago there was a Lockheed Electoral, a wonderful airplane, but it had some major problems and again it was a new airplane, had some crashes and there was a period there were people call Eastern and say, are you going to put me on an Electoral? I won't go. That was long ago. I don't think we'll get to that now, but if we keep having incidents and smoke coming out of Boeing, airlines might start to take the hit. Michael Boyd, President of Boy Group International. Thanks so much for joining us again. My pleasure, sir, you have a good day ahead. And in other news, I'm Gianna Jalosi, a library in Worcester, Massachusetts has come up with a clever way to pardon people who owe overdue book fees. They're going to scratch those fees in exchange for a picture of that person's cat or any cat for that matter. They say the goal is to encourage people to read and visit the library, even if they owe money for a lost or damaged book. The initiative is called Feline Fee Forgiveness as part of the library's Montfong March MiaoNess event. The library has events scheduled during March MiaoNess, including crafts and cat toy making story times lectures, a movie screening of cats, and even a de-stress cat petting session. The professor says, quote, a librarian is a book lover, a cardigan lover, and a cat lover. I'm Dana Perrino. Mike Pence What's on your mind? Checktalk is a national security threat to the United States of America. The social media juggernaut is the Chinese Communist Party control program used to surveil more than 150 million Americans, both young and old. Checktalk is Chinese spyware that allows the Chinese Communist Party to manipulate the minds of young Americans at will and compromises the privacy of millions of Americans. It is essentially digital fentanyl, a 21st century technological weapon. The app is so potent and addictive that TikTok is banned within China. The version of TikTok approved for use in China is watered down. Free of an algorithm set for addiction and focused on educational purposes. Meanwhile, TikTok is the most popular social media for American teenagers, allowing the CCP to so discord and feed the American people communist propaganda through their phones. Ultimately, the threat which TikTok poses to the security and privacy of Americans must be addressed before it's too late. Fortunately, we're not starting from square one. The Trump Pence administration took historic action. In 2020, our administration issued an executive order intended to force the Chinese Communist Party to sell TikTok. Unfortunately, the Biden Harris administration revoked that executive order soon after taking office, as they sought to roll back virtually everything done by our administration, regardless of merit. Just as it ignored Chinese spy balloons flying overhead, the Biden administration has done nothing to address Chinese spy programs on our devices. While Congress pushed Biden to enact legislation banning TikTok on official government devices, that hasn't stopped its campaign from posting away on its own TikTok. Even still, I am grateful that Biden's use of the app hasn't kept him from backing the bill moving through the House of Representatives this week that would force the sale of TikTok. I just wish it hadn't required the upcoming election for him to take the threat seriously. The protecting Americans from foreign adversary-controlled applications act is carefully crafted. While a TikTok ban would violate the First Amendment, forcing TikTok to divest from the Chinese Communist Party as this bill is designed to do is just common sense. Today, every politician likes to talk tough on China. Unfortunately, too many politicians talk a big game, but crack under the pressure of wealthy donors or personal grudges, including my former running mate. In lobbyists for a company controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and turn a former president against his own political legacy, we should all be concerned. The era of appeasing the Chinese Communist Party is over. The Trump Pence administration was the first to confront the threat posed by TikTok, and I will never falter in my commitment to confronting China at home and abroad. Having TikTok to continue operating in the United States while under the control of the Chinese Communist Party is simply unacceptable. We would never have let Russia run the nightly news during the Cold War, and we certainly can't let China do the same now. And allowing TikTok to continue to spew Chinese Communist Party sanction propaganda, poisoning the minds of American children, is just wrong. Enough is enough. We should act this week to pass legislation forcing the sale of TikTok and President Joe Biden should immediately sign it into law. This is Mike Pence, the 48 Vice President of the United States.\",\"Donald Trump tightens his grip on the GOP as his preferred candidate wins the Ohio Senate primary. Plus Intel wins the biggest grant yet to build chip factories in the United States. And a head spinning day in the courts, the Supreme Court allows then another court blocks a Texas law that would allow the state to deport non-citizens. In theory, the Federal Government is still the only power that can enforce immigration law along the boundary. Who is actually doing what right now? Well, we're trying to find out. It's Wednesday, March 20th. And here's the AM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories moving your world today. The Immigration rules governing the Southern U.S. border have been thrown into disarray this morning after the Supreme Court yesterday allowed Texas to begin arresting and deporting non-citizens on its own, only for an appeals court to step in hours later and block any such efforts. Jess Bravin covers the Supreme Court for the Journal, and he joined us now. Jess, I'm sure it was a very busy evening for you. Two court rulings seemingly at odds with each other. What have they said? So this involves a very aggressive Texas law to really take charge of immigration enforcement, something that Texas says the Federal Government has failed to do. It allows the State Government to arrest and deport non-citizens on its own. The US government and some immigrant rights groups went to a federal court asking that this law be blocked. That's saying that it was unconstitutional. A federal district court in Austin, Texas, agreed and blocked this law. Texas appealed and a federal appeals court temporarily allowed the law to go into effect, only to have that ruling stopped by the Supreme Court for several days while it considered the Government's next appeal. The Supreme Court on Tuesday said, okay, the law can go into effect. We're not going to intervene in what's going on in the lower court. We're not going to tell the Fifth Circuit what to do about it. So therefore the law can go into effect. Except that a few hours later, the Fifth Circuit changed its mind and said, actually on second thought, the law cannot go into effect for now. We're going to hold a hearing on it on Wednesday. So until then, what's the status on the border? Who is controlling immigration between Texas and Mexico right now? In theory or in reality? In theory, the United States Government, the Federal Government is still the only power that can enforce immigration law along the boundary. Who is actually doing what right now? Well, we're trying to find out. We have reporters on the scene who are doing their job and trying to figure out what exactly is happening. Definitely something to watch today. In the meantime, why is this such a legally contentious issue? Well, it's hard because at the core there has been gridlock in Washington DC over what to do about immigration. The last time there was a major immigration overhaul was in the 1980s. Since then, there have been some near misses, but the Democrats and the Republicans have not been able to get together about how to handle immigration, and that has led to problems at the border and changes in policy between administrations as they try to work with a relatively old legal framework, for a situation that is changing. Some states, particularly conservative-led states along the border, have attempted to take matters into their own hands because they are the front line. They're on the border. So that's where most migrants cross, And that's counter to what the Federal Government had wanted. It had tried to block this from going into law in the first place. What's the Federal Government saying now after these rulings? Well, the last time that we heard from them, they were criticizing the Supreme Court decision allowing this Texas law to go into effect. They repeated their argument that it's unconstitutional. They say you can't have each state making its own immigration law, and it's going to damage our ability to control the border because foreign governments won't know even who to talk to. It's going to undermine our relations with other countries, particularly Mexico, which is where most of the migrants are coming from. And in fact, as soon as the Supreme Court said Texas's law could go into effect, the Mexican Foreign Ministry said, we are not accepting any deportees from the Texas State Government. We don't deal with the Texas State Government. We deal with the United States Government as a sovereign to sovereign. So that worry certainly came into reality very quickly. And what has Texas said? Texas officials said they were pleased with the Supreme Court's decision, but noted that there were still many legal proceedings to come, and those new proceedings came quicker than many of us expected to see. So what's next? Is this for Congress to fix? Or will these Supreme Court rulings be the final law? Well, there are going to be more proceedings about what happens to this Texas law called SB4, because once the Fifth Circuit takes its next step, the unhappy losing party, whether that is the State of Texas or the Biden administration, can go back to the Supreme Court. They could ask for a rehearing at the Fifth Circuit. There're going to be many more legal steps over this law. The question is whether it is allowed to go into effect before we get a final decision. If it does go into effect, it will be a major, major change in the way immigration rules are enforced in the United States, because if Texas can do it, so can every other state. So it would really create a lot of upheaval in the way immigration is handled in the United States ahead of the November election. That of course, is what Texas wants to see. They don't like the way it is being done now. They want to upheave it. The Federal Government, however, says that would only make things worse. The implications of course, go well beyond the courts. They go into politics and they go into part of the arguments that both President Biden and his likely Republican challenger, Donald Trump are making about who has the better approach to enforcing immigration law. That was Journal Supreme Court reporter, Jess Bravin. Jess, thanks for getting us up to speed this morning. You bet. Bernie Moreno has won the Ohio Senate Republican primary election. The latest evidence that former President Donald Trump has strengthened his control over the GOP. I wear with honor my endorsement from President Trump. I wear that with a badge of honor because under President Trump, this nation was safer. It was more secure. We had prosperity around the world. Moreno will face Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown in November. Moreno is a businessman who has not held office before and who dispatched a candidate from the more traditional Republican mold. Matt Dolan was endorsed by Governor Mike DeWine and former Senator Rob Portman, and Dolan had been critical of Trump. Democrats had hoped Moreno would win. A super PAC aligned with Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, had spent millions of dollars to boost Moreno's standing with conservatives. The Ohio Senate race is expected to be one of the fall's most competitive. We're exclusively reporting that the European Union is pushing back on efforts to sanction Iran for arming its allied militias in the Middle East. Germany and France had proposed new sanctions on Tehran for its support of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and other militias in Iraq and Syria. But as the Journals Laurence Norman explains the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell says not so fast, He says particularly now he believes that that could lead to some kind of Iranian retaliation, which could escalate the current conflict in the region over Gaza. And he also says it could undermine diplomacy with Iran on nuclear issues and other issues. EU officials say the United States supports Borrell's decision to slow the effort. The issue will come up tomorrow and Friday when EU ministers gather in Brussels for a council meeting. Coming up, Samsung shares rally on reports Nvidia is looking to buy some of its next generation chips plus Elon Musk's struggle to lure content creators to social media platform X. We've got those stories and more after the break. The AI hype is showing no signs of abating with Korean tech giant Samsung this morning rallying on reports that Nvidia is looking to buy some of its next generation chips. It comes after Nvidia shares posted a gain yesterday when reporters managed to eke out price estimates for the AI giant's new chips. Here's our Deputy Finance Editor for Europe, Quentin Webb. So each of these, so-called Blackwell chips, might cost between 30 and $40,000. But previously we'd heard estimates of $50,000. And to put that in context. The current chips known as Hoppers, the H100 costs about $25,000 a piece. So Jensen Huang said he wants to make the widest possible group of clients be able to afford these chips. I mean, remember that the AI hype has already buoyed Nvidia shares a lot and it's filtering through to other parts of the global market. Samsung is a little bit behind some of its rivals such as SK and Hynix, but this is seen as confirmation that it's likely to catch up a bit. And if you look, for example, at the Japanese stock market, which has done very well recently, a lot of the biggest drivers there have been semiconductor companies or semiconductor equipment companies. A lot of that is related to AI enthusiasm. Samsung has declined to comment on a possible supply deal with Nvidia. In other chip news, the U.S. government is granting Intel the largest award yet from the $53 billion CHIPS Act. Up to $8.5 billion dollars will go toward new factories and expansion projects in the four states of Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, in a bid to revive American chip-making. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the Intel investments will put the US on track to producing 20% of the world's leading edge chips by the end of the decade. Recently, much of the world's chip production has shifted to Asia leaving the U.S. with around 12% of the world's manufacturing in 2020. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's plans to boost content creator revenue on X are falling flat. The platform formerly known as Twitter, is competing with the likes of TikTok and Youtube whose viral content attracts big advertisers. Alexa Corse covers X for the Journal and told our Tech News Briefing podcast how some creators are left questioning Musk's strategy. X has been trying different efforts, different products, over the past months, but creators say that it's not really still clear to them how that translates to revenue or a sustainable business. One creator told me advertisers are the foundation of the creator economy. And if X is going to offer to share advertising revenue, the question is how much are advertisers going to be spending? And we know X has been struggling to attract advertisers, especially these big name brands who are nervous about Musk's changes and changes to content rules and other changes he's made to the platform. And you can hear more about X's struggles to attract content creators on today's Tech News Briefing podcast. The US has dropped eight places in the annual World Happiness Report, falling from 15th place to 23rd. Clare Ansberry writes the Turning Points column for The Journal. She says The drop is in large part because of unhappiness among younger Americans. So young people are sadder for several reasons, and a key one is loneliness. They spend less time interacting with people in person and don't feel as connected as they used to to their jobs or other institutions like churches. And they're also worried about money, about being able to find affordable housing and buy groceries and global issues like the war in the Middle East and climate change. It is the first time the U.S. is not among the top 20 happiest countries since the global ranking began in 2012. Afghanistan is still the unhappiest country in the world while Nordic countries dominate the top 10, with Finland at the very top. And finally, the first games of the NCAA tournament have begun.

Until then, thanks for listening. All three major US indexes soared to new records after the Fed holds rates steady. And, what's happening at the Southern Border with a Texas immigration law on hold. It's Wednesday, March 20th. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. After a two-day policy meeting, Federal Reserve officials didn't significantly change their economic outlook. Most officials penciled in three rate cuts this year in their new projections. Still, some officials expect fewer cuts this year than they did back then. I asked our chief economics commentator, Greg Ip. We are still on track for rate cuts this year. And going into Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting, investors thought that June was the likeliest month, that the Fed would start cutting rates. Coming out of the meeting, they still think June is the most likely. In their projections, Fed officials said they still see three-quarter point rate cuts this year. I suppose if you wanted to read some significance into this though, you'd find that there were a few officials among the group that thought there would only be two. So there's been a little bit more sort of hawkishness with respect to the outlook for inflation, which means that on the margin, maybe there's a little bit less likelihood of big rate cuts this year. So the Fed kept the projections pretty steady despite solid economic growth and inflation that was a little higher than expected in January and February. So what does that signal to us? Chair Jerome Powell, in his remarks to reporters, made it clear that he still thinks that inflation is progressing towards a lower level of around 2%, which is their target. The January and February data, he portrayed those as probably driven by seasonal noise, not indicative of the underlying trend. Now, he has made it clear in the past that what the Fed is looking for is confidence that inflation is headed towards 2% from above 3%. So to the extent that the January and February data didn't add to their confidence that that's happening, it didn't really give him the green light to go ahead. But I think one of the main takeaways from today is that it clearly didn't give them a red light and not really even a yellow light either. Powell still seems to be generally constructive and optimistic that things are falling into place the way he hopesAnnmarie Fertoli: All three major US indexes closed at record highs after the Fed's announcement. The last time the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all closed a record on the same day was more than two years ago on November 8th, 2021. We've been covering the Supreme court's decision to allow Texas to enforce its own immigration law, allowing the state to arrest and deport non-citizens. As you heard this morning, just hours after that decision, Tuesday, an Appeals Court reversed course, blocking any state efforts to enforce the law for now. The on-again, off-again legal showdown between Texas and the Biden administration meanwhile is causing confusion at the Southern Border. Joining me now is Elizabeth Findell, our US news reporter in Texas. Welcome, Elizabeth. Thanks for having me. So Elizabeth, we knew yesterday's Supreme Court decision was not the final word here. This is still playing out in the lower courts that Appeals Court halted enforcing the law hours after the Supreme Court decision. And today there was a hearing on the matter by the same court, the Fifth Circuit. What did the court discuss? This was a three-judge panel and they asked questions of the attorneys for Texas and the attorneys for the United States. Two of the judges seemed to differ pretty sharply in their interpretations of the judge. We had Chief Judge Priscilla Richman, an appointee of George W. Bush, who seemed pretty skeptical of the law. She noted that no state has ever done this before, questioned how deportations would be carried out. And then you have Judge Andrew Oldham, who is a Trump appointee, and previously worked for a long time for Texas Governor Abbott who seemed more sympathetic to the state's arguments and kind of questioned how we could know that all elements of the law are invalid when it has never been tested. So is there any other action pending right now? Do we have a sense of what might be next? Well, the question before the Fifth Circuit right now is whether or not to keep this law on pause while further legal proceedings play out. And they did not give an indication during the hearing of when they will make a decision on that question. Meanwhile, Elizabeth, as we have been reporting, there's been some confusion on the ground. How is all of this playing out at the Southern Border? Really, there hasn't been much happening. The law was very briefly yesterday allowed to go into effect, but that didn't really give the state time to actually start going through the process of these types of arrests. So presently, nothing has really changed enforcement-wise. The state does arrest people for criminal trespass if they're on private property, which is not an immigration charge, and they either give them that state misdemeanor charge for criminal trespass if they're on private property or they hand them over to the federal government. ,But either way, they hand people over to Border Patrol. That's our US news reporter, Elizabeth Findell. Coming up, hedge funds, private equity groups and other investors are exploring stakes in law firms in Arizona. We'll explain why after the break. We report exclusively that the US Justice Department is considering whether to allow WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange to plead guilty to a reduced charge of mishandling classified information. That's according to people familiar with the matter. This opens up the possibility of a deal that could eventually result in Assange's release from a London prison where he's been since 2019. Any deal would require approval at the highest levels of the Justice Department. A DOJ spokesman declined to comment. Assange, who is 52, is fighting a drawn-out legal battle with the British government to avoid being extradited to the US to face trial for publishing thousands of confidential US military records and diplomatic cables around 2010. A new bid is in for Paramount Global's film and TV studio. We report exclusively that private equity firm Apollo Global Management has made an $11 billion offer for the company. That's according to people familiar with the situation. An independent committee of directors is currently reviewing another offer from Skydance Media to merge with all of Paramount, which owns CBS and Nickelodeon. Paramount has long been an acquisition target, but the company's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and other board members have resisted selling the studio, which they consider the crown jewel of the company. Apollo's offer is a big one. It's more than the entire market capitalization of Paramount Global, which currently stands at around $7.7 billion. The Biden administration is enacting the strictest ever rules for tailpipe emissions, but it's also giving the car industry more time to comply. The rules released today by the Environmental Protection Agency ratchet up more gradually than regulators originally proposed, pushing the industry toward majority EV sales by early next decade. The less aggressive rollout is a win for traditional automakers who had lobbied hard for a slower implementation as the pace of US EV sales decelerates. The new rules apply to light duty vehicles. Those include cars, sport utility vehicles, and most pickup trucks for model years 2027 through 2032. And, a new skin test can detect Parkinson's disease. The neurodegenerative condition is usually diagnosed by symptoms like tremors, stiffness, slow movements, and problems with balance, which can take years to appear. The new test, a skin biopsy, works by detecting an abnormal protein that people with Parkinson's have inside their nerves. There are only a handful of these tests in use or development. CND Life Sciences is one of the companies that produces them. CND's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Todd Levine, says the test costs just under $1,500 and is usually covered in part or in full by insurance. He said the goal is to detect Parkinson's before people develop symptoms and treat them with drugs that could slow or stop the disease. The program was launched three years ago with the goal of expanding access to legal services for people who can't afford or find lawyers. In 2021, the state's Supreme Court lifted a requirement that the owners of law firms need to be attorneys. Since then, non-lawyers have been allowed to open firms known as alternative business structures. Private equity, hedge funds, and other investors are now taking notice. Arizona's program is at the center of debates over how to expand access to legal services and about who profits from the legal ecosystem Here now with more on this story is National Legal Affairs reporter Erin Mulvaney. Welcome, Erin. Thank you. Thank you for having me. So Erin, how did this Arizona program start out? What were the goals of creating a model like this? Arizona and even other states have studied the idea of lifting that barrier that only lawyers can own law firms. But it's a highly controversial notion in the legal world because the idea is that a lawyer has an ethical duty to his client. So there's been some wariness of allowing somebody who's an investor in some way or an entrepreneur have some kind of ownership in these law firms. So this was studied by folks in Arizona as a way to expand legal services, understanding that there's a huge dearth of attorneys for certain services. Some are critical like eviction services or family law, simple things like divorces, property law. It's just hard to find lawyers covering those things. So this was just a way to create a structure that would potentially infuse capital into new businesses and expand legal services. So that was the idea. There wasn't necessarily a specific prescribed thing that these had to be, but it was definitely to address the access to justice issue that Arizona and honestly a lot of other states are confronting. So how is it working a couple of years in? It sounds like there's a wide range of services offered. Yes, it's hard to judge. It still is pretty early in the process, but I looked at all 70 of them that have been approved that are new businesses in Arizona, and some were difficult to research. They're still so new they don't even have an online presence yet. But 1\\u002f3 of these firms are mass tort and personal injury firms. And then there are other buckets, legal Zoom type, online services. And then there are some kind of random ones, some niche things like focusing on the metaverse. There's a bounty hunting one. There's some that seem a little dry estate planning and taxes, but they really do range. There seem to be a lot of creative structures out there. Right, really across the board there. Let's get to that investment piece. I really like this quote from your article from Ted Farrell who runs Litigation Funding Advisors. He said, \\\"Every other business is allowed to take growth capital to pay their expenses. The question is how much smart money wants to get in bed with lawyers?\\\" Erin, what's the answer to that when it comes to this program? It's hard to give an exact answer to that, but we do have estimate that about 30 to 40% of these businesses have attracted outside investors in the form of private equity or hedge funds. Already, investors do look to mass litigation and to fund litigation around the country, but they don't have an equity stake because like we said, there's that barrier. So it kind of provides a new runway for litigation finance that isn't available in most places. And that's What's News for this Wednesday afternoon. Today's show is produced by Pierre Bienaim\\u00e9 and Anthony Bansie with supervising producer Michael Kosmides. We'll be back with a new show tomorrow morning.\",\" I'm Charles Payne.

A Supreme Court decision on whether Donald Trump can even be prosecuted in his already delayed federal election case could be more than three months away, even deeper into the presidential campaign. If President Trump is officially the nominee then, if we're doing debates, but during the day he's stuck in a federal criminal trial, like, it's just so strange, but by winning the ability to have the Supreme Court hear his case, he's bought all that time that is in itself a win. And Lisa Brady. New research raises an even bigger red flag about junk food and the amount people are eating. Part of the challenge is that when we walk down the street, you were grabbing a snack, it's more readily available to buy a bag of chips than it is to buy an apple. And I'm former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. Mitch McConnell is stepping down a Senate Republican leader in November after a record 17 years on the job. The Senate can tuck you in the Senate. It's been an honor of my life to lead my Republican colleague, who says, been the highest privilege. He helped transform the federal judiciary with the Senate confirming three conservative Supreme Court justices and more than 200 lower court judges under McConnell's leadership. Historic case being taken up by the Supreme Court is whether Donald Trump has presidential immunity against prosecution in his federal election interference case. It was originally supposed to start next week. Listen, the delay is a win at this point. Even if he loses at the Supreme Court decision likely by late June, if it follows the protocol that we think it will, could come sooner. But okay, that's the drop to deadline is by the end of June. Even then, only does the trial court unpause where it was when this whole thing started, meaning pretrial motions and discovery of big federal criminal case. That can take weeks or months. That means this potentially pushes the start of that trial to September, October. Is that something special counsel Jack Smith is going to want to do that close to an election? They're just, it's really tough optics if President Trump is officially the nominee, then if we're doing debates, but during the day he's stuck in a federal criminal trial. Like, it's just so strange. But by winning the ability to have the Supreme Court hear his case, he's bought all that time that is in itself a win. Why couldn't you do all the pretrial motions and pretrial proceedings and hearings concurrently with all these appeals and say, okay, once the Supreme Court makes his decision, if Trump loses, bam, we can get going almost right away. When the case officially goes on appeal, the district court, that trial level court loses its custody of the case, meaning it can't do anything. It doesn't technically hold onto the case anymore. So it's lost control of the case while it's pending on these appeals, meaning I don't if you remember a while back that there was discovery there, you know, what Trump's legal team argues is that there are millions of pages of discovery. This is going to take time. Well, the government will still providing discovery, meaning exchanging material. And the Trump team fired back and said, oh, no, no, this whole thing's supposed to be on pause. Don't give us stuff that, you know, we would have asked for in the process of a trial. So they wanted everything paused and that's what happened. So technically, the trial court doesn't have custody of this thing, meaning they couldn't restart it if they wanted to. Got it. Okay. Now, there is some outcry that the Supreme Court has been slow walking this to Trump's benefit. Is that at all a fair assessment? Well, for people who maybe aren't as familiar with the Supreme Court, this is lightning speed. This is them on the super fast track. The fact that they would say, okay, we're going to get into this thing and we're going to hear arguments in April, meaning everybody's going to get to fully brief this thing. We are handling this as a case on the merits for them to add it into their already jam packed calendar, which at this point isn't taking any more cases. It actually is quick for them. So it may feel slow by everyday standards, but for them, this is sort of rocket, docket action. Well, speaking of the Supreme Court, that's part of Mitch McConnell's lasting legacy, along with getting a lot of other conservative judges on the bench. He's going to go back to being a regular little senator. Let's talk about his legacy and what he might be remembered for. I think you nailed it. I mean, there's so many things. He was such a, he is a really great tactician. Much in the way that you would hear people over on the house side talking about former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, like they know how to get votes done. They know how to negotiate. They know how to procedurally use every bell and whistle that's available in the, just a procedure in the way that things get done to actually get things accomplished. But I do think for Mitch McConnell so much of that is going to be the justices and the judges that were done under Trump's four year term. We all remember when, you know, it was still President Trump running for election that there was a situation when obviously Justice Scalia passed away and there was a knockdown drag out fight over trying to get that seat filled by Marik Garland. Now our attorney general. However, the election and Mitch McConnell locked it down, held it firm. That seat did not get filled by Democrats and it eventually went to Justice Gorsuch. So I mean, those moments and those judicial appointments which outlive any Senator, any president by sometimes decades is certainly going to be at the top of his legacy. Mitch McConnell says he's going to, he's going to finish out both jobs that he was elected. He's going to, he'll be his party's leader until November and he will then finish out his Senate term as elected to it by the people of Kentucky. Just not run for election in 2026. Is this a health thing or is this a, this is Donald Trump's party now thing or is it both? To me, it feels like both. I mean, the last time I sit down, did I sit down interview with him? I mean, you could tell that he's definitely as most people in their 80s and especially after having a serious injury that he had last year, but he just moved slower. His mind seemed to sharp as ever. I mean, again, the negotiating and the tactics and the strategizing. But I think physically he's weary. I think the death of his sister-in-law recently was a blow to their family. I think he can read the writing on the wall. He sees the politics have changed that President Trump is running the GOP, not Mitch McConnell. I think we're going to see that in the selection of a successor to him. I think that President Trump is going to have a very heavy weight on that scale. Yeah, we'll talk about that in the coming weeks and months, of course. Meantime, Mitch McConnell says he's actually looking forward to just going back to being a regular old senator and maybe with his feet up and watch how it all plays out. Hunter Biden finally gave his deposition this week as expected. Democrats say that this puts the whole crooked Biden thing to bed. The impeachment inquiry should be, and there's no wrongdoing here Republicans who say the Biden's are crooked. Still, of course, say the Biden's are crooked. Do we know much of what was said in there? We don't. I mean, other than we, of course, are going to expect that the first son is not going to go in there and say, yes, my father crossed all the ethical lines and so did I. And I caused him to do it. I mean, like everybody knew going in, like Hunter was not going to say that. Now, what Republicans have come out to say is that there were inconsistencies. There were things that that he and James Biden, the brother of the president, have said that don't line up with other previous statements or the statements of other people like Tony Bob Linsky, who was in business with Hunter. So Comer comes out of their sort of victorious, whether it's faux or real in his heart, saying, okay, we're onto the next step, which is this public hearing, which clearly it appears that Hunter's legal team is not very interested in. But he says that's the next phase of the impeachment hearing that we have plenty of things and plenty of material and we're moving forward. What do you make of this uncommitted movement against the president? 13% in this Democratic primary and Michigan voting uncommitted. Now, large part that was a protest of the president's support of Israel's war in Hamas is Michigan a special case with its large Arab American population, especially in some of the cities there, or is this going to spread? And will it matter in November in terms of maybe turnout in closed states? We'll see, but I think in Michigan, gosh, people were, they were organized. I mean, to take your effort to go vote for somebody that you know is not going to win uncommitted and to do it in such big numbers, I think, was very much an absolute message targeted him over the way that things are playing out in Gaza. Now even if it's just confined to that one state, that can really matter. Michigan is a very critical state that he won by a relatively small margin the last time around. So it's not as if those folks who voted uncommitted are going to show up and vote for president Trump, but they might just stay home. So that's a real problem. The White House has had a real sensitivity to that particular state and what it says. But even if it just stays there, that's a problem for them potentially. This Bloomberg News morning console pulls out Michigan six other swing states, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nevada, and Wisconsin. Guess who went over seven and who went seven for seven and those? That could do is for the White House. These are critical states where the average across all the states, I think, was about a five point advantage to president Trump. But some of these states that they broke out into states that Biden actually won in 2020, Trump had a six point lead in those states. So this should be alarm bells for the White House. Again, they keep feeling like, all right, the economy is approving. People are going to feel better, the closer we get to the election. And people will come home. You know, they're going to come home to vote for me because they're not going to want the chaos of president Trump. Both of them point the finger at each other and say, if you elect this guy, it's going to be the end of democracy. Right now, it appears in these these very critical swing states, the Trump message is resonating amidst things like the border and the economy and all kinds of things that people say, are their top issue and that they also give the edge to president Trump on handling those issues? Yeah. Super Tuesday coming right up. We, that was the first mention we've had of Nikki Haley in this conversation. So far apologies to her and her supporters in her campaign. What's going to happen after Tuesday? She's going to pick up some delegates here and there. Does she have the money to go forward and the will to go forward? She has the money right now. It's not a donor problem for her. It's a voter problem for her. She's going to keep making this argument. But then when you have things happen, like you've got the Illinois judge this week who decides to kick president Trump off the primary ballot, those are the kinds of things that are going to give her an argument to say, listen, he may not be a choice everywhere. I've got to stay in and keep fighting. They've always signaled towards Super Tuesday and yes, she's going to pick up some delegates that day. But then the real question becomes what is the purpose and how much longer does this fight last? She does have the money, but she doesn't have the votes at this point. We talked about this last week. Finally, then I'll let you go. There's a moving Congress to firm up the legality of IVF. It was already in the works before this decision in Alabama to declare that embryos are people. We talked about this, but is it going to remain a headache for the Republicans going forward? Donald Trump has come out and said, look, I'm all for IVF. Biden says, look, this is all his fault. Well, again, I wish that people would read the Alabama decision to get the truth of the matter of what there was no discussion about lying IVF or anything else. Now I get that people worry that the reasoning of the case could lead to ripple effects of legality and the possibility of liability for these clinics. They got to figure that out. It does present Democrats with another good talking point, I think, for ads and for the campaign trail, but they're being a bit disingenuous about what's actually going on. That doesn't matter. Both sides do it if they have an issue that works to their advantage, but I think it's going to be on state legislatures too very quickly. Make clear that they're going to put together legal protections for parents and clinics and doctors. You can listen to her hosting the podcast. Live in the Bream. Shannon, see ya. Chris, thank you. I'm Guy Benson. Join me weekdays at 3 p.m. Eastern as we break down the biggest stories of the day with some of the biggest newsmakers and guests. A lot of the packaged foods we find at the grocery store are getting a bad rap in new research on ultra processed foods which tend to be high and unhealthy added ingredients. International researchers conducted the largest review so far of the existing analytic evidence involving nearly 10 million people. The results published in the British Medical Journal BMJ show that diets high in ultra processed foods can raise the risk of 32 health problems, including about a 50 percent increased risk of cardiovascular disease related death and a 12 percent greater risk of type 2 diabetes. Dr. Ashley Gerhard, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, told lawmakers in December studies have found key signs of addiction with these foods. At the same hearing, health committee chair Senator Bernie Sanders said the diabetes and obesity epidemics go hand in hand. How did it happen according to the CDC that the rate of childhood obesity in America has tripled since the 1970s tripled since the 1970s. The newly published review points to a higher risk of cancer, sleep disorders, depression, asthma and gastrointestinal issues as well as heart disease along with a 21 percent greater risk of death from any cause. Though there are varying degrees of evidence graded by the researchers on a scale from convincing to suggestive for week. My first reaction about ultra processed foods being bad for our health is that it's something that we sort of have already known because ultra processed foods contain many ingredients industrialized ingredients. Dr. Lisa Young is a registered dietitian nutritionist, author and adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU. The foods that you can't make in your own home kitchen, the foods that have a lot of salt, sugar, unhealthy ingredients. So it does make perfect sense. But finally we're putting it together that these ultra processed foods, which are junk foods, really can increase risk for obesity, heart disease, diabetes, early death, anxiety and the list goes on and on and on. Let's give people a little more context about what ultra processed foods are, especially as opposed to just processed foods. And I know you kind of alluded to it in a nutshell when you said they have ingredients that you can't make in your own home kitchen. Is this list ever expanding or has it pretty much stayed the same for a few decades now? You know, we're really kind of honing in and we're debating certain foods and on where those certain foods might fit in. But for foods like soda, cookies, candy, again, not something that you're making with three ingredients at home. These cereals, I mean, these are clearly considered ultra processed foods and it's foods that have the word ultra in front of processed. So frozen vegetables, for example, are processed but they're not heavily processed. And so we want to distinguish something, baby carrots are somewhat processed but they're not ultra processed. So when you're seeing something with 10, 15 ingredients, ingredients that you cannot pronounce, things that have added sugar is the first ingredients, a enriched wheat flour that's white flour that's stripped of the whole grain, that is an example of something that is going to be ultra processed foods. I know a lot of snacks would fall into that category too, like potato chips, for instance. When it comes to cereal, I know some of them, the big manufacturers, have made an emphasis in recent years on saying, you know, whole grains now instead of the alternatives. So do we have to consider, you know, all cereals and breads that aren't whole grain or that aren't brand, for instance, in the case of cereal, you know, do we have to consider those all bad or is it, there's really a distinction there? I believe that there is a distinction. So first of all, you might have something like an oatmeal, like a plain oatmeal, something like that would be, you know, the best. But if we're talking about, let's say, a cold cereal, and you can have a cereal that is really just a whole, I don't want to use brand, so I'll stay away from that. But let's say you have like a cereal that's like whole grain and that's the first ingredient. So that's the most important thing is the order of ingredients. And so the first ingredient says it all, that first ingredient is whole grain oats or whole grain, then you are in far better shape. And if there's only one gram of sugar, of added sugar, then you are in much, much better shape than you are. If the first ingredient is sugar, the second ingredient is enriched wheat flour, the third ingredient is salt, and then down the road, you know, you might have something like a whole grain. So a sugary cereal, something that has more than five grams of an egg sugar, a cereal that's going to be low in fiber, those are problematic. This research warns about eating too many ultra processed foods, and that begs the question how much is too many. Yeah, you know, it's so interesting because I have studied portion sizes and I've tracked the history of portion sizes, getting larger. And in December, 2022, I co-authored a paper on my latest work in the American Journal of Public Health. And what we found was that the ultra processed food portions, those are the foods that have increased in size and have continued to increase in size. So sodas are still jumbo sodas. We've got chocolate bars, french fries, we've got, you know, those hamburgers in the fast food places that are made on the processed white flour, that these portions of ultra processed foods are too big. So often when you like how many is too much, it isn't just a number, one, two, three, it's also what is the size of that product. You don't get no exactly what that cut off is, but the one thing we do know these say is the less the better. One of the most eye opening things about this research is that these kinds of foods, the ultra processed kind, account for up to 58 percent, so well over half of total energy intake per day in the US. Are people ignoring the warnings so far that we've had about these foods or are many just not able to work around it or not work around it easily enough to, you know, make enough changes? Because obviously for a lot of people, cost becomes a factor and time management also becomes a factor. The healthiest things tend to cost more and to be more time consuming to prepare. Yes, that's true, but there are work around and for example, 58 percent, and I want to just reiterate this important statistic that you, that you gave, 58 percent of total energy that means 58 percent of the total calories that we eat, so almost 60 percent of our diets are coming from junk food, just to sort of like we frame that for people. And I think you don't have to be perfect and you don't have to be, it's not black and white, but I think there are small changes that we can make. Now that doesn't put frozen fruits and vegetables that are relatively inexpensive, so we can keep a bag of frozen fruits, frozen vegetables at home at all times. There are things that we can do to make it easier, can beans, you know, slightly processed, but again, it's not ultra-process or keeping those things at home. But part of the challenge is that when we walk down the street and we're grabbing a snack, it's more readily available to buy a bag of chips than it is to buy an apple. So if you just pack an apple with you or an orange and you just make that little bit of an effort, that will go a long way. To drink water instead of soda. That's half the battle. Notably, I think this is one of those, and I want to call it a trend, but because this is a recurring theme now with multiple studies showing the potential risks of eating to many ultra-processed foods compared to other things, other things that are trends, diatrends that tend to come and go. Are there any things that you're seeing right now that are actually not working or on the flip side that are helping people? For instance, intermittent fasting. That's been the thing that I've heard a lot about lately. Yeah, I think something like intermittent fasting, you know, it takes away the importance of what you eat and it focuses more on, you know, when you're eating. But so I'm going to argue that if intermittent fasting works for you, then, you know, go for it. But at the end of the day, it often works because when do you eat your ultra-processed junk food, you know, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock at night? So I think a better message is to make lifestyle changes and to focus on adding in different foods that you like more of. Colorful fruits and vegetables. Start with that. Browsen fruits and vegetables. Start with that. And to really pay attention to what it is and how much it is that we're actually eating. Another big focus lately for a lot of people has been trying to eat more protein. Have we gone too far with that? Oh, absolutely. You know, I've been in this field for three decades and there's always a flavor of the day, nutrient of the day. And sometimes it's carbs, sometimes it's fat, sometimes it's protein and what's happening right now is that people think more and more and more is better. And yes, it's great to have some protein-rich foods at each meal because protein aids in satiety and helps you feel fault. But so does fiber. And often when you eat a lot of protein like the keto diet is in season these days, but you don't even have to go keto to eat too much protein. We're also having a lot of these bars and these shakes and these powders. But I got news for you folks. We are not sufficient in protein. That is not a nutrient that we need to worry about. And we definitely are going overboard with protein. And again, it's not just protein coming from fish, chicken, meat, eggs, you know, beans. You can be a vegetarian, you get plenty of protein. But it's those powders, those shakes, those bars that do fit into that ultra-process food category as well. So really if we're looking at the big picture, it sounds like everything always comes back to moderation and balance. Absolutely. Moderation, balance, choose color, eat a colorful diet, you know, and eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, more plants. Doesn't mean you have to be extreme. You don't need to go extreme. And you want to enjoy your food as well. So you want to, when you eat more healthy, you sort of retrain your palate that you want those foods. And then you no longer want that child food.

Kennedy saves the world. It is five days a week every week. Matt Whitaker. What's on your mind? The moment he took office, Joe Biden and his administration have engaged in a full-fledged campaign to weaponize the federal government against their political opponents and people of faith. Recently, 11 anti-abortion protesters were convicted for peacefully protesting and praying at a Tennessee abortion clinic in 2021. Their crime, arriving at an abortion clinic before it opened and sitting in prayer while handing out flyers that share the value of human life. These pro-life activists were convicted under the freedom of access to clinic entrances act, otherwise known as face, a 1994 statute that makes it a federal crime to interfere in any way with a person's attempt to get a medical service. Initially, the face act was passed to protect both the supposed rights to access abortions and the right to protest peacefully, as well as the safety of churches and pregnancy centers. Sadly, churches and pregnancy resource centers have been subject to a spree of violent attacks in the wake of the Dobs decision to which the Biden administration has turned a blind eye. However, under the Biden administration's weaponized justice department, the face act is primarily being used to go after people of faith who stand up for what they believe and protest to protect innocent life. Each of these 11 peaceful protesters now faces up to 10 and a half years in prison and finds up to $260,000 for participating in that day of prayerful protest. Luckily, Congressman Chip Roy and Senator Mike Lee have moved to repeal the face act and replace it with a bill of their own. Titled the Restoring the First Amendment and Right to Peaceful Civil Disobedience Act, which would prevent the Biden administration from weaponizing the federal government against Christian conservatives. But the weaponization of government against conservatives and people of faith doesn't end there. In 2021, the Biden administration released a memo instructing the Department of Justice to go after concerned parents at school board meetings after receiving a letter that compared these parents to domestic terrorists. Last year, it was also revealed that the FBI mounted a spying program on traditional Catholics, particularly those interested in the Latin mass and identified them as individuals who might be part of the far right nationalist movement. In the eyes of the Biden Department of Justice, these Christian patriots are the actual threat to the American way of life, not the criminals who are hijacking, terrorizing, and even killing everyday Americans in our cities. The administration has clearly made use of the justice system against their political enemies. It's clear they consider everyone who opposes their views as enemies as well. These unprecedented acts of weaponization of the Justice Department prove that the Biden administration is eager to deploy the full force of the federal government against its perceived political enemies while letting real crimes, such as the DC riots and the destruction of federal property, go unpunished. As Americans continue to fall victim to rising crime and violence in their neighborhoods, the Biden administration should focus on keeping our community safe and putting real criminals behind bars. The Department of Justice should never be used as a weaponized arm of the executive branch to harass, intimidate, and stifle political opposition. The American people should demand better from the Biden administration. If President Biden continues to go after Christians and other people of faith while letting the real criminals run free, justice remains nowhere to be found in the DOJ except for its name.

The Everglades, you've probably heard of it. That massive wilderness of wetlands on the southern tip of Florida. It's home to the largest mangrove ecosystem in the western hemisphere and it's a sanctuary for over three dozen endangered and threatened species. It's also the water supply for about 9 million Floridians. The Everglades is a crucial ecosystem and it's in crisis. Climate change, pollution, agriculture and rapid development are causing potentially irreversible damage. Almost 25 years ago, the state of Florida and the federal government struck an extraordinary deal to save the Everglades. But from the moment it passed, the problems began. The plans have been crippled by years of trade-offs and backroom dealing and rising costs with little to show for the billion spent. Meanwhile, South Florida is thirsty. The population keeps growing, the climate keeps changing and the Everglades keep dying. Today I'm talking with Environment Reporter Ginny Stilettovich from South Florida's WLRN radio station. Ginny has a new podcast series out called Brightlit Place that tells the dramatic story of the Everglades, what's been done to the ecosystem and what needs to happen to save it. Stay with us.

Here with WLRN Environment Reporter Ginny Stilettovich talking about the Everglades. Ginny, for people who've never been to South Florida, what are we talking about? What are the Everglades? So the Everglades really are this huge wetland system that covers basically all of South Florida. And within the wetland are these different areas. They're swamps. You still have mangrove forest, four story tall mangroves down at the southern end. The biggest feature of the Everglades is probably the river of grass. 40 miles wide and 100 miles long. And if you think of a river, a shallow river, that's literally what it is but filled with sawgrass. It looks like a sea of sawgrass, but if you were to wait out into it, it would be shallow water moving very, very slowly from north to south and out into Florida Bay. There's also all of this wildlife. Can you talk about that? So when you go into the Everglades, you encounter just this variety of wild and exotic and flamboyant wildlife. There are panthers in the Everglades. There are flamingos in the Everglades and bonded bats with ears that are like, literally like bonnets. They're the largest bats in North America. There are lots of snakes. There's butterflies that you can't find any place else on the earth. There's fluorescent blue. In the sawgrass, the waiting birds that come and roost there are some of the weirdest that you've ever seen. There are things called woodstorks. They're often nicknamed the preacher's bird because when they're on the ground, they wrap themselves in their wings that are black on the outside, but when they take off, they're white underneath. There are rosy at spoon bills that have these bills that are shaped like spoons so that they can hunt for fish. They use the bills to swish back and forth in the water. Swallowtails that are as big as your hand. Swallowtails that are migrating flock to the mangroves so you'll be inside the mangroves and you'll just hear this chorus of warblers singing all around you. It's just a menagerie. I mean, that sounds like really incredible biodiversity and like a really unique ecosystem. Does Everglades play a role in the larger environment? On a planet-wide global scale, we're on the Atlantic flyway for migrating birds that fly up from the bottom of South America to the Arctic and in terms of climate change, the marshes and the pit soil below them along with the mangrove forests are huge carbon sinks. They are like America's Amazon. For the Florida ecosystem, it is hugely important in terms of water supply in South Florida. Like modern South Florida would not exist without the Everglades because those marshes that I keep talking about essentially filter water in a shallow drinking aquifer that supplies water to about 9 million Floridians. So during the wet season, the Everglades basically helps keep the rest of South Florida dry. It holds a ton of water that might otherwise flood neighborhoods and cities and then during the dry season when you actually needed water supply, those marshes were there to give us that water supply. Really it was this perfect balance between the wet and the dry season and the things that you needed to happen in the wet season which is sawgrass marshes absorbing water. That's what they did and all that water would flow down the river of grass and it wouldn't just like flow straight but it would also flow out the side and areas where there were depressions in these coastal ridges. So is it kind of like a bowl, a shallow bowl? Is that like the water? Exactly that. Yeah. Essentially would get fresh water flowing all offshore around Florida and that's what helped create really beautiful beaches in these estuaries and within those you just get the variety of wildlife and fish and miles and miles of seagrass meadows that are basically the nurseries for a lot of wildlife. Well I would imagine though that the Everglades have probably changed a lot in the last century and I would imagine that it has to do a lot with human beings. For sure. So the Everglades before modern South Florida arrived, covered about 4,000 square miles and now they're down to about half that size. Florida became a state in 1847 and just a few years later, you know, the leaders of this new state said how are we going to create an economy? Well let's drain the Everglades and turn them into farm fields. Starting in the late 1800s early settlers came in and started draining parts of the Everglades and they built these canals to control water during the rainy season that started drying up the river of grass which they thought was a good thing at the time. So all that drainage essentially wiped out half the Everglades, turned it into farm fields. It was hugely successful because that peat soil was so mucky and rich that you could grow anything there and it became the winter bread basket for the U.S. Was there also a pollution from the farming? Yes. So all those farm fields that grew up around the Everglades used fertilizer and one of the common ingredients and fertilizer is phosphorus. So when you started growing all that sugar cane and all those other crops, it started to pollute the Everglades with this, with phosphorus. The Everglades however, thrives with very little phosphorus. That's why you get these sparse sawgrass marshes. That sparse grass allows water to flow. That kind of grass does not need a lot of phosphorus. When you get too much of it, it spurs too much plant growth and it allows other plants that need phosphorus to grow to come in and take over this area. So you started seeing other plants come in and start choking the river of grass. One of the most damaging plants is cat tails. They're a native plant but they grow in parts of the state where phosphorus occurs naturally. When you get cat tails, bull rush, other kinds of marsh grasses moving in, it stops up the water flow. So I guess all of this, you know, meddling from flood control projects, water diversion, like what does this mean for the way that Everglades function naturally? What that did was ruin basically the infrastructure that nature built that provided a natural flood control and drinking water supply. So you know, South Florida, parts that used to be wet were now dry and dry parts were wet. You essentially get a breakdown of this natural system that filtered and stored water and instead everything is being drained to make way for farm fields and cities. And the consequences of that were these freshwater marshes, the estuaries and bays and the fishing grounds also got screwed up. They were too salty. They weren't getting enough freshwater. And without that freshwater, you get seagrass meadows dying and the nurseries were bonefish and tarpon and some of the sport fish that draw people from all over the world were going away. All of these cascading and environmental effects, but I would imagine that there are also lives and livelihoods that are at stake here. There's two people I met that I wanted to tell you about who just in their lifetimes have seen the Everglades transform dramatically. There's an island over here. We've got a lot of trees and it's high and when the water's high, it never goes underwater. Michael Frank is one of the guys I wanted to tell you about. He's a member of the Mika Sookie tribe, historically the tribe lived on what are called these tree islands which rise out of the river of grass. They were formed by sediment piling up and tree roots over thousands of years. Michael was born and raised on a tree island called Highland and he told me here are members being able to spear fish in the marshes because the water was so clear. The Mika Sookie even have a special name for the Everglades. Kahae lit, kahae lit means a bright, lit place. It's like shining, look at it. Look at it shining, the water from the sun. Kahae lit means say, kahae lit, kahae lit means light. It's lit up. You can see all the way to the bottom and you will see sometimes even a topens, even fish that's in the bay. They were from all the way. Yeah, we used a spear to get our fish right. It's a big old topens. Oh man, I'm going to have big dinner. Boom. His spear was gone. Anything that could migrate their way into the house, they made it out into the Everglades because it was crystal clear. I went out of the water with another person who remembers the good old days of fishing. He's a second generation fishing captain, Tim Clyde. I like the most famous bonefish spots in our backyard is what we call downtown. Shell, Key, Ligton, Vite. So he took me out on some of the flats in Florida Bay. These were once world-class fishing grounds covered with different kinds of sport fish. Records were set here, but now those fish are going away. You know, like 70% of the grass is gone. And that's where the bonefish fed and stuff need to change. So we just need water somewhere in another. We need water in our bay before it dies again. And I should say the idea of losing these fishing grounds is a really big deal here in South Florida. You know, fishing is hugely important, not just economically, but culturally. So all of this is happening because humans are trying to control the water. Yeah, this idea of really controlling and taming nature. I mean, it's something that America was built on. But when the US government came in and was doing all this stretching and flooding the triilins out, you know, Michael Frank was six years old when Highland went underwater. What, three-four feet underwater? And while that work was going on, Michael Frank's family and the rest of the tribe that lived out there on the triilins, they were forced to move to higher ground. They told my grandfather and grandmother, if that day ever come, your island goes underwater, it will come and build up your camp. But that never came and built up the camps. That was one of many broken promises. You know, the government didn't do anything to protect the islands. So what that meant was that Michael Frank's family, along with other members of the Micahsoupi tribe, had to move to the Tammy Amy Trail. The trail is the highway that was built in the 20s to connect both Florida's coast. But that move really changed the tribe. They'd lost it not just their homeland, but their hunting grounds. And so a lot of people were living along the highway, basically selling trinkets to tourists traveling the highway. They eventually got reservation land to the north, but they're still fighting to recover these ancestral tree islands that are basically being washed away by flood water and water that's kept too high. I mean, it sounds very bad. The Native Americans have been displaced, the birds, the mammals, the coastal fisheries are all suffering these huge declines. The land has been cut up, drained, flooded, just a mess. So, but it wasn't supposed to be like this, right? Like there was supposed to be a solution. Right, so in 2000, Congress passed what's known as the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. And at the time, it was hailed as this huge win for the environment. It had strong bipartisan support. And it was also the largest hydrologic restoration plan ever undertaken in the US. It was supposed to be a model that could have helped us figure out how to deal with some of the impacts from climate change. But it was going to be expensive. It was expected to cost $8 billion, and would probably take a couple of decades to finish. So, a couple of decades from the year 2000, that seems like this should be wrapping up right about now, then, right? Yes, if things had gone according to plan. But that's not the way it worked out. When we come back, what happened to that big plan to save the Everglades? Stay with us. 2020, is that you? Because this year's presidential race is feeling like deja vu. It's shaping up to be another Biden Trump showdown. On the It's Been A Minute podcast, what this deja vu does for our feelings towards democracy. Numbers that explain the economy. We love them at the indicator for planet money. And on Fridays, we discuss indicators in the news, like job numbers, spending, the cost of food, sometimes all three. So, my indicator is about why you might need to bring home more bacon to afford your eggs. But I'll be here all week. It can be hard nowadays to find a space where we're able to listen to each other, where we can agree to disagree. It's why I'm proud of 1A, a show that's made for you and by you. We're not about snark. We're about dialogue. We're back talking to Ginny Stilettavitch, host of the podcast, Brightlet Place, about the Everglades. So, Congress passes massive plan to restore the Everglades. I'm sure there were sign-in ceremonies and all this press conferences and what have you. So, what happened? Well, the solution on paper seemed pretty simple. The scientists said they knew exactly what needed to happen. The formula for restoration isn't hard from the ecological perspective. They just needed to get the water flowing again, but that turned out to be a complicated thing to do. You have to maintain all these other things and you can't affect anybody and you can't have any other consequence. That's hard. This is hydrologist Tom VanLant. When I spoke to him, he was really frustrated by the people aspect of restoration. There are so many stakeholders, landowners, companies, government agencies. There are all these interests in the Everglades, and you know, it will be impossible to get water back into the Everglades without affecting the stakeholders. So, what all this means is right after the Everglades restoration plan came into law, the problem started. The first was with Congress itself, the restoration plan, was bipartisan, but then gridlock set into Congress right after it was passed. It was also just a rough blueprint for what needed to be done, so it included dozens of projects. It was like 50 main projects and 68 components within those 50 projects. And part of the plan said that as you're going along a cost escalates too much, you have to bring it back to us and have it reauthorized. This was actually a pretty standard way to get things done in the past, but after it was passed in 2000, the projects didn't get authorized for another seven years, and that was just a small group of projects. And then took another seven years to get another small group of projects passed. So, it seems like things are falling behind schedule. Yes, and at the same time, South Florida was having yet another one of its building booms, which made things even more complicated. I spoke to Julie Hill Gabriel, who's an attorney with Audubon. She was working in South Florida in the early 2000s when restoration was still fairly new. You have what is pegged as the world's largest ecosystem restoration effort that had really just begun. And at the same time, the land that is currently still available in the Everglades is being targeted to be drained. So, we're going to initiate the world's largest effort to restore wetlands, well, at the same time we're filling in and destroying the wetlands that were made. She was, as you can hear, understandably really frustrated that the restoration plan didn't seem to have any teeth. And that made Audubon's work, which is to advocate to get restoration done unnecessarily difficult. We had some projects that were initially designed to use certain footprints of land, and then local governments were approving that land to be developed for new communities or businesses. And so, we kept having to change some of the project designs based on what was actually available. So, Congress had passed as big plans, but local governments are meanwhile approving land to be developed. Did the state of Florida not have a plan to set land aside to be restored? No, and that was part of the problem. Those original architects of the restoration plan, they worried that if the state was allowed to seize the land, you know, the plan wouldn't get passed and it wouldn't get the support it needed. So, they relied on willing sellers and a lot of the land that they needed for projects was privately owned farmland, and mostly sugar cane fields. In 2008, U.S. sugar briefly agreed to sell most of their holdings to the state, and that could have changed restoration for good and altered the course of history, but that deal fell apart, and they have mostly opposed selling land going forward. The U.S. sugar program, which guarantees the price of domestic sugar, also provides huge incentives for farmers to say in business. Okay, so I'm guessing with all these delays that costs are also increasing. Yes, the price just went up and up, and today restoring the Everglades is expected to cost $23 billion. So, that's three times the original price, and it's just like this vicious cycle, because prices going up causes further delays, since, as I mentioned before, it was written into the plan that if costs change, then projects have to be reauthorized by Congress. I mean, this all sounds very familiar. I mean, when you think of these giant public works projects, it's that they drag on and on, and then they get more and more expensive. Yeah, there's the bureaucracy aspect, but then environmentally speaking, certain problems are as daunting as ever. You know, when we look at water that's supposed to go into the Everglades, the pollution levels are still too high, and that's despite valiant restoration efforts to reduce the pollution and get it under control. So we talked about the phosphorus problem and sugar farming, and the state of Florida's already spent more than a billion dollars trying to clean that water by building these massive treatment marshes, but they're not working. So I took a trip on an airboat to one of the treatment marshes to see what was going on, with Eric Crawford. He's a wetlands ecologist, and he oversees the vegetation that they grow in the marshes to try and suck up all the phosphorus pollution. You want to do a little gentle loop into the marsh, see some of the birds and plants, and then we can stop. At first glance, it's weird because it's a treatment marsh, but it looks like another sort of beautiful slice of the Everglades. Yeah, you didn't think you'd enjoy sitting in the middle of an industrial wastewater treatment facility, but that's where we are. There's birds all over. There's American lotuses, these big, platter-sized plants growing on the water, and there's also a ton of alligators and snakes. Oh, okay. Well, I mean, with the snakes and the alligators, I would leave that to you. I'm sure it was, you made it out all right, because I'm talking to you. Yes, thankfully they put airboats when people are in the water to keep an eye out for the snakes and alligators with rifles. And what did Crawford tell you about this facility? Yes, so as beautiful as a treatment marshes are, while we're at on the airboat, Crawford also showed me signs of how the treatment isn't working as well as it needs to. We're getting closer to the front end of the system here, and you can see there's a lot of nutrients we have all this algae growing in the mud. Here is the problem while they're beautiful and they are working hard, they are still not getting water clean enough. Scientists have said that to put water back in the everglades, the phosphorus has to be at these really low levels of 13 parts per billion. That is like one drop in a 10,000 gallon swimming pool. And the marshes has succeeded at taking out tons and tons of phosphorus, but what they're not able to do is get the phosphorus levels down to those tiny, tiny levels. The other thing is these marshes also have to do double duty and act as stormwater marshes when hurricanes or tropical storms come through. So then they have to stop treating the water and trying to clean it. Instead, they have to offer flood control. And that's a completely different operation. That then the structures open up in the water moves. But then we have to be ready to switch back to the trickle, let's go for water quality performance. And now it's switch modes. You don't get two different teams. You get one piece of land to do both. Whenever there's a big storm or hurricane, which, as it happens, is getting more common with climate change, all this polluted stormwater runoff gets channeled into them. So the treatment marshes are not able to do the job that they were originally intended to do, which is to get the water clean enough to send into the everglades. I mean, it seems like they're asking too much of these treatment marshes. Yeah, yeah. There's now a 2025 court deadline that requires the water coming out of the marshes to meet the pollution limit. But scientists say that it is unlikely that we're going to meet that deadline. There's one team of scientists that says another 30,000 acres of treatment marshes are going to be needed to meet those goals. Yeah. OK, so to recap, basically Congress set the plan but has it funded the projects on time, the water needs to be cleaned and more marshes need to be created. That's not happening. Meanwhile, more and more development is happening on land that should go back to be restored. And on top of that, the ag industry continues to use fertilizers that are polluting the water. So none of it is working the way it should essentially. Right. So it's all these problems, a series of problems. And it winds up being like whack-a-mole. From everything that you're saying, it sounds like restoring the Everglades is kind of an impossible promise. I mean, it may be that there are folks who think that it'll never get done. But it turns out that the hammer and all this restoration has been the courts. I mean, they're the ones that can force both governments, the state, and the federal government to do things. And it's thanks to federal laws like the Clean Water Act that we have this 2025 deadline for the pollution limits. And really, that could help determine how restoration moves forward. Because so far, nobody is willing to make the really hard choices that are needed to save the Everglades. The ag industry continues to get the water it needs. Cities have gotten their water plus flood control. And they still get to keep growing. And despite all the promises, restoration never seems to be the priority. We are now asking the Everglades to do the same job that it did a century ago on half the footprint. It's not succeeding, and it's dying at the same time. And you can see that in every corner of the Everglades, whether it's the tree islands where the Mika-Suki once lived, or algae blooms that are fouling Lake hook a choby, or the fishing grounds where Tim Klein was once a trophy-winning guide. The Everglades is his national treasure, but we're not treating it that way. That requires sacrifice, and so far, no one is willing to make those sacrifices. After all these years of reporting, do you have one lasting image of the Everglades that stays with you that makes you feel why this place is so important? You know, I've thought about that a lot lately. And it's almost more than an image. It's the sound. It's how Florida is noisy and busy. The high rises and the highways and the traffic jams. And the Everglades, no matter what part you're in, it's like walking into sometimes nothingness because it is wide, open, quiet space. So you really get the sense of the end of the world. We are a peninsula. We are literally the end of North America. I mean, I kind of close my eyes, and I could like visually see these steps down from the sawgrass marshes down into the mangrove forest. It's like you're in this green cathedral, and you hear birds and birdsong echoing through these forests. And you just don't have that kind of solace any place else, or at least for me.

Are you ready for drag queen bingo?Speaker 2: On a corner stage at Hamburger Mary's, a drag bar in downtown Orlando, two queens named Ginger Minj and Gidget Galore sang songs, called out bingo numbers, and cracked jokes. Speaker 3: Either it's going to be that we're in the dark at a bath house or we're flaming on the surface of the sun. Speaker 4: Well, let us flame on. We fought our whole lives to be able to say gay, (inaudible) we're not going to stop now. Speaker 2: There were gay and straight people in the crowd, men and women, young and old people. A few families brought school-aged children. Everybody was having a good time, but for the owner, John Paonessa, this is the front line of America's culture war. Speaker 5: I never thought I would be in a lawsuit that would be taken to the Supreme Court. Speaker 2: John and his husband sold insurance before they opened the bar in 2008, and they had fun running the business for over a decade. Then last year, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law barring minors from performances that include what it calls lewd conduct. John felt like a target had been placed on his business. Indeed, DeSantis made this vow when he was sworn in for a second term that January. Speaker 6: Florida is where woke goes to die. Speaker 2: The Hamburger Mary's Orlando franchise is a plaintiff in a federal lawsuit to overturn that DeSantis initiative. A judge in Orlando blocked the law from taking effect. The state's lawyers pushed the US Supreme Court to narrow the scope of that reprieve, but the justices declined to intervene. The drag restrictions are just one part of the culture war in Florida. DeSantis has signed laws that restrict medical procedures for transgender youth, prohibit instruction on gender identity in K to 8 public schools, ban funding for diversity programs on college campuses, and allow parents to object to books in school libraries that they find offensive. DeSantis cited the legislation, as well as his quick release of COVID-19 restrictions, while running for a big reelection win in 2022. He also hoped it would juice a bid for the White House, but his campaign fizzled after the Iowa caucuses in January. Which raises the question, do these culture war issues really have national appeal, and how big of a role do they play as Republicans rally around former President Donald Trump? I went to Florida to find out exactly who gets excited by these culture war issues, and how important they are for voters thinking about who they'll support the presidency. Speaker 7: November 5th is going to go down as the single most important day in the history of our country. Speaker 2: With the general election matchup between Trump and Biden set, Florida's March 19th primary will be a bit sleepy. But examining the state's politics, and DeSantis role in shaping them, offers insights into how relevant the culture wars are to Republican voters as it relates to their choice for president, and how Trump, who has focused his campaign on other issues like immigration and his prior White House experience, has held onto the Republican base throughout the primary. A colleague, Arian Campo-Flores, has lived at the Sunshine State for the last 20 years, and he's seen the political climate change. Speaker 8: Florida, for a long time, was like the quintessential purple swing state in the US. And part of the reason for that is it's like a collection of very different regions that are constantly in flux. After the 2016 election of Donald Trump, Florida began really sort of tilting increasingly red. So Trump won in 2016 by a very narrow margin, then he won in 2020. When he lost the overall election, he still won Florida by about three points, which by Florida standards, was a significant margin. And then from there it just was sort of like off to the races. Speaker 2: One person who exemplifies that shift is DeSantis. He won the governorship in 2018 by less than a percentage point, but in 2022 he was reelected by almost 20 points. DeSantis started off with moderate policies, particularly on the environment, that crossed party lines, but he really came into his own during the COVID-19 pandemic when he lifted restrictions on schools and businesses sooner than most other states, even amid warnings from medical experts. Speaker 8: He really began to pursue this agenda that focused a lot on schools, on corporations, on the workplace, and was his self-described war on woke. It's hard to keep track of all the measures and policies that he pursued, and put in place, and effectively carried out, because there was just so many of them. Speaker 2: Here's some highlights. In 2022, DeSantis signed a law prohibiting instruction of gender identity in lower elementary school grades. That bill, dubbed Don't Say Gay by its critics, led to a high profile fight with Disney. A year later, after winning that reelection, but before launching his presidential campaign, he signed another round of bills. The new laws made it easier for objecting parents to remove a book from a school library, and prevented transgender people from using public bathrooms that don't correspond to their sex at birth. They also included that statute that John Paonessa is challenging. Speaker 6: We have a very crazy age that we live in. There's a lot of nonsense that gets floated around, and what we've said in Florida is we are going to remain a refuge of sanity and a citadel of normalcy, and kids should have an upbringing that reflects that. Speaker 2: To John, it was all done with an eye toward the White House. Speaker 5: I think, by and large, people are supportive of the LGBT community, but the Republicans have their base who are going to follow them and listen, no matter what. Speaker 2: There isn't much public polling about what Floridians think about these cultural war policies. A poll by Siena College in the fall of 2022 found that most voters surveyed opposed DeSantis law restricting instruction on gender identity. A poll last summer from Florida Atlantic University about the spat between the governor and Disney, which began over the education restrictions, found mixed opinions by voters, but both surveys showed a stark partisan split with broad support for DeSantis policies among self-identified Republicans. People like Robin Lankford. She's a member of Tampa Republican Women Federated. I spoke with her at the group's monthly soiree about the laws limiting instruction on things like sexual orientation. Speaker 9: I like the fact that he has taken a stand to allow parents to be involved and parents to have a say. That shouldn't even be a question, I don't think. And I think that it's a parent's responsibility to teach those specific things, and I think Governor DeSantis has done a great job in applying that logic. Speaker 2: But Robin said she wasn't ready to support DeSantis for the presidency, mostly because Trump is still around and she remembers his time in office, fondly. Another person I met that evening is April Schiff. She's a Republican state committee woman, and she's been running campaigns for the last two decades. She said there are limits to how you can use the culture war while running for office. Speaker 10: I don't think the voters are as much as the activists and the people that are involved that are pushing those issues, and for them it's very important issues, but I don't see the voters going, \\\"Oh, yeah. That's a big deal. \\\"Speaker 2: April had actually been with DeSantis earlier that day in Plant City, which is about 25 miles east of downtown Tampa. He was making a trip to the annual Strawberry Festival, which is like, well, it's like a strawberry flavored state fair. There was a strawberry spaghetti eating contest, a strawberry shortcake is supposedly really famous, and you've got a whole big group of people here. Right now, we can see people frying up. I don't know what they're frying. They're frying something. I caught a quick glimpse of DeSantis as he passed through with his son. Then I asked voters about him, Trump, and the culture wars. What I heard at the fair lined up with Robin's take. DeSantis was a little too green in their eyes for a White House run. Bob Sanetick, who moved to Florida after he retired, told me that the school issues weren't at the top of his mind. Speaker 11: They're not big issues for me, but they're issues. I don't like to see that kind of stuff with the grade school-age kids. That should be left to the parents. Speaker 2: Bob told me he's a diehard Trump supporter. Other people who support the former president cited his positions on immigration and the way the economy was during his tenure. John and Kathy Bugg told me they saw no reason to turn to someone else even though they liked DeSantis. Speaker 12: I feel they've opened the border, which they shouldn't have done, because Trump had it closed. And the economy, everybody was doing well when Trump was there, and now everything's double the price. Speaker 2: But then there are the activists, who April Schiff was talking about, for whom the social fights are a big deal. We'll hear from some of them after the break. Last fall, Julie Gebhards got up to speak in front of the local school board. It went viral. Speaker 13: This is in children's libraries here in Hillsborough County, approved by that committee unanimously at Plant High. It's in multiple schools. There's 10 images of that woman's naked breast in that book. Speaker 14: Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker. And no one's allowed to bring displays. Am I right Mr. Porter? That is a rule and we-Speaker 13: This is in a library book in your classrooms. Speaker 14: Thank you. Next speaker. Speaker 13: We can't show that here?Speaker 14: Thank you. Next speaker. Speaker 2: Julie's a mother of six who lives in the eastern reaches of the county closer to Plant City than to Tampa. She's become a regular at school board meetings, and on October 17th, she was objecting to a graphic novel called Blankets. The book, by Craig Thompson, is about a boy coming of age, including a love affair with a girl he meets at church camp. Gebhards focused on illustrations of nudity and a sexual encounter between the two characters. She said she considers the book to be shameful and degrading, and she tried to have it removed from the library at Plant City High School. I met her when I went to Florida earlier this month. Speaker 13: And that's what I feel like my goal and my job is, to expose and let parents decide for themselves. If they want their kid to read it, then that's their prerogative. Speaker 2: After Julie started speaking up four years ago, she got involved with a group called Moms for Liberty. The organization embraced DeSantis slate of culture war laws, and its members used their provisions to object to texts. Around 300 books were removed in the 2022\\u002f23 school year. Many had to do with LGBTQ themes. Tina Deskovich, one of the women who founded Moms for Liberty, said her group is inclusive. But its critics see a darker effect of these laws. Katie Blankenship is a lawyer who runs the Florida office for Pen America, a writer's group that's been at the forefront of fighting against book removals. It's suing a school district along the Florida panhandle over its removal of several texts. Have you been busy?Speaker 15: That's what everyone ... they're like, as soon as I tell people I'm the director of the Florida office, and they're like, \\\"Oh, my God. \\\"Speaker 2: I met Katie near a bookstore in Winter Park that had a whole shelf dedicated to banned books. DeSantis, for his part, says it's not fair to say books are banned. They're just taken out of school libraries. Either way, a store clerk there said the books sell well, and that people are surprised to see classic titles among them like The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood. Some conservatives argue the culture war issues have brought people into the political sphere. Once establishing a common goal in addressing culture fights, candidates or campaigns can then talk to those voters about the economy and other issues to tell them about the party, but it's less clear whether people who are animated by them represent a vocal minority or a widespread constituency. Tina Deskovich said that 29% of members of Moms for Liberty, which appeals to conservatives, but is technically nonpartisan, had never before voted in a primary. 12% of members weren't registered to vote. Tina said about 66% of the group's members identify as Republicans. Speaker 16: We're not trying to bring people into the Republican Party. If that's a byproduct of the work we're doing, that's fine. Speaker 2: But there are signs of the group's influence is stalling. Fewer than half of the school board candidates endorsed by Moms for Liberty in 2023 won according to outside analysis, and the percentage was lower than in 2022. Bridget Ziegler, another founding mother of the group, was involved in a sex scandal opening the organization to charges of hypocrisy. Tina said Bridget hasn't been heavily involved with the group for a while, and that the hypocrisy charges are just haters hating. Bridget has rejected calls to resign as a school board member, and said at a meeting that there's, quote, a lot of hyperbole and rhetoric out there. Katie, from Pen America, pointed out another sign of the culture war ebbing in Tallahassee. State lawmakers, this month, declined to act on several bills, including one that would've banned the rainbow pride flag from public buildings. And lawyers for the state and LGBTQ groups this month settled a lawsuit over the so-called Don't say Gay law. The state will clarify that there could be discussion of sexual orientation in school, just not instruction. Both sides claimed victory. And that book Julie objected to last fall when she went viral, it's still in the school library after a district committee voted unanimously to keep it. Julie, who was joined by her friend Alyssa, said she's not discouraged, and she'll keep speaking up. Speaker 13: I think traction, for me, is measured in people knowing, and exposure, and being able to be in a public forum, and have a voice. And so that's how I'm measuring success. And I do think any organization, like Moms for Liberty that started two years ago, there's going to be some setbacks. There's going to be some things that happen that you didn't anticipate happening, and it's what are we going to do now? We're going to get back up and-Speaker 17: Start reading (inaudible).Speaker 13: ... keep at it. Speaker 2: You can't dispute that these issues are part of the political discourse now. DeSantis will be governor of the country's third-largest state through the end of 2026. Moms for Liberty will continue to organize in more places. But talking to voters in Florida, it does seem like these efforts are still only happening on the edges. Republicans who I met were generally supportive, but not excited. Nobody, other than Julie, told me it was a top issue for them in the presidential election. That's something DeSantis learned too when he lost to Trump by double digits in Iowa, and public polling showed him similarly behind in his home state. But my other major takeaway is that DeSantis is sitting on a solid political foundation. People who told me they supported Trump over him didn't fault DeSantis for pursuing the culture war. They said it either wasn't enough of a motivator to back DeSantis for president or it just wasn't DeSantis' time, partly because Trump had a battle tested record on immigration and the economy. April, the state committee woman, and her friend Terry Castro, put it well. Speaker 18: The national issues are a hundred percent different. And people don't really want to hear what you're doing in Florida, they want to know what are you going to do for us, for the United States of America. Speaker 19: I'm a huge DeSantis supporter, but if I had been advising him, 2028 is your lane, baby. 2028.Speaker 18: 2028. That's (inaudible).Speaker 19: Don't challenge President Trump.

Plus China condemns US efforts to force a sale of TikTok, leaving few options for owner ByteDance. If you're ByteDance, you're between a rock and a hard place here.

A federal judge in Florida has rejected an effort by Donald Trump to toss out the classified documents case against him, which involves his handling of classified materials at his Mar-a-Lago residence. US District Court Judge Aileen Cannon acknowledged Trump's motion to dismiss the case presented some arguments warranting serious consideration, but said those questions could be raised later in the trial. In one effort to dismiss the case, Trump's lawyers argued that a portion of the Espionage Act under which Trump is charged is unconstitutional. But Cannon said that striking down the statute would be, \\\"Quite an extraordinary step.\\\" Trump has pleaded not guilty in the case, which had initially been set to go to trial on May 20th, but Trump's lawyers have sought a delay and federal prosecutors are now pushing for a July start. Voting has begun in Russia in a presidential election that Vladimir Putin is all but guaranteed to win, with his potential challengers barred from the ballot and his critics either jailed or having fled the country. Given that, our Moscow Bureau Chief Ann Simmons explained the logic of even holding an election. It really is a way for Putin to signal to the rest of the world that he's in charge, that the Russian people endorse him as the leader of Russia. A high turnout and a high vote for Putin, it's basically also an endorsement of his policies and essentially his war in Ukraine. So there was really a full court press by the Kremlin in terms of getting out the vote. They were insistent that the heads of corporations, of industries, that they basically mobilized state workers to go out to the polls. Voting ends on Sunday and a Putin victory would hand him another six year term in office and with it the chance to become Russia's longest reigning leader since Joseph Stalin. Turning to the Middle East, Hamas has called for Palestinians to confront Israel today at the Al Asqua Mosque in East Jerusalem, where large numbers of worshipers are set together. The Islamic Holy Month of Ramadan has been an occasion for violent confrontations at the compound between Palestinians, Israeli authorities and Jewish worshipers in recent years. However, Hamas' political leader did call for a march at Al Asqua to coincide with the start of Ramadan on Sunday that failed to materialize. And the mosque has been largely calm this week with Palestinian leaders saying Israelis have been allowing entry by Palestinians after restricting access since the beginning of the Gaza War. Well already faced with a hunger crisis, displacement and the widespread destruction of homes and businesses, a shortage of cash is now compounding the devastation in Gaza. And for those fortunate enough to have savings or be receiving salaries in Gaza, the Journal's Omar Abdel-Baqui reports that wildly fluctuating prices are adding to the challenges of daily life. Omar, I think a lot of focus, understandably, has been dedicated to how much food aid and other aid is reaching Gaza. And that is a part of the territory's wartime economy. But Gaza has wage earners, it has rent payers, people who rely on buying all manner of products and who are very affected by forces like inflation. What is the state of Gaza's wartime economy now?Omar Abdel-Baqui: So prices in Gaza's desperate wartime economy can be looked at through a simple supply and demand lens. Supply is very low in the enclave for food and other essentials and demand is very high as hunger and starvation is spreading. And so prices have shot up for things that are acquired on the marketplace. Food prices have more than doubled compared to pre-war levels, according to the Palestinian Bureau of Central Statistics. And some staples like flour and salt are 10 times higher than they were pre-war, that's according to the World Food Program. And there are certain other things aside from food that have increased dramatically like rent. So there are over a million Palestinians who are displaced, sheltering in the south, in the border city of Rafah, because of fighting in the north and after the Israeli military urged people to move south. So because of that, rent there has skyrocketed. We spoke with one man, Mustafa Ashkar is his name, before the war, the apartment that he's staying at in Rafah was 1,500 Shekels and now it's 4,000 Shekels. And he's living off savings and he's burning through his savings because of that high rent. And so when he wants to obtain other essentials like diapers, he barters things that he doesn't need as much, bartering cans of beans to get diapers for his 1-year-old. So Omar, prices very clearly there are spiking for those who have the means to pay for essentials. Though you report that many people can't even access cash or digital payment systems. Omar Abdel-Baqui: Yeah. I mean, one, it's important to note that most people are reliant on aid and handouts and are living off aid and handouts from humanitarian organizations or their relatives or their friends. But those lucky enough to have money to their name are having difficulty accessing that cash. So about 80% of people in Gaza are now unemployed. Those that are employed work in either the humanitarian sector or the medical sector. And so they're getting a salary, they just can't get the money because the banking system is essentially paralyzed. Many ATMs and many bank branches have been destroyed along with the money in them. And those that do exist are concentrated heavily in the south, in and around Rafah. So in many cases, those ATMs, which there are only a handful left, they have hours long lines, they run out of cash all the time. And to make matters more complicated, Gaza hasn't had reliable electricity or really any electricity since the beginning of the war. And in addition, there are frequent telecommunication blackouts, so people are not able to rely on electronic transactions either. In terms of what's being done to address these many challenges, in recent days, we have seen airdrops into Gaza of food and other supplies. The US is also setting up a maritime corridor with some partner countries that could bring in additional supplies. Is any of that having an effect at the very least in stabilizing the situation in Gaza?Omar Abdel-Baqui: So not really. The amount of aid coming in from the air is a lot lower than the amount of aid that was coming in via truck. It might make a dent in those already rapidly fluctuating prices, but it's unlikely that those airdrops will stabilize prices. And the maritime corridor is going to take quite a bit of time to get off the ground. The US sent ships from the coast of Virginia and it'll take around 45 days to make it to Gaza. So it'll take quite some time for that aid to make it. Given that, Omar, it sounds like Palestinians in Gaza are going to be waiting for a long time for this situation to improve. What does the severity of this economic situation mean for them and for the territory longer term?Omar Abdel-Baqui: Yeah, the consequences are dire, I would say. The economic situation is intertwined with a larger humanitarian situation. 27 people have died from starvation or dehydration in recent weeks. That's according to health officials on the ground. And if more supplies don't enter the enclave, we'll still see these sky-high prices, unaffordable prices to many people. And we'll see starvation and hunger spread. In the long term, it'll take a long time to rebuild Gaza's banking system, economy, governance structure. It will be a Herculean task. Omar, thank you so much for bringing us this story. Omar Abdel-Baqui: Thank you for having me, Luke. I really appreciate it. Coming up, China signals that it won't allow a forced sale of TikTok in the US. And a cockpit mishap is the likely cause of a terrifying plunge on a Boeing flight to New Zealand. We've got those stories and more after the break. The Chinese government is signaling that it won't allow a forced sale of TikTok, blasting the US for its moves, targeting the video sharing app. John, we heard some pretty fiery language yesterday from China on this. Tell us what jumped out to you. They're not happy with the possibility that TikTok may be locked out of the world's biggest economy, it's largest market. You heard the Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Thursday say it's an overstretching of national security to keep down a good company from a good country that the US doesn't like. They used this phrase, \\\"It is sheer robber's logic to try every means to snatch from others all the good things that they have.\\\" So that's pretty strong language, pretty direct. Sounds a little strange in English, but I think we all get the gist of that. Well, at least ByteDance executives seem to, John, given that we're reporting that they've interpreted that as meaning that Beijing would rather the app be banned in the US than sold? Yeah. I mean, look, ByteDance, they were a company that was founded in China, and China still ultimately has control over this company. So if indeed Beijing is going to frown upon any forced sale in the US, then ultimately I think that's probably the way that ByteDance has got to go. So if you're ByteDance, you're between a rock and a hard place here. You have two governments that aren't going to budge, that are effectively rivals here. If you do anything that shows that you're willing to comply with one side, then the other side immediately distrust you or isn't going to be happy. Meanwhile, we are seeing fresh signs of headwinds for China's beleaguered property sector as new home sales plummet. Sellers of secondhand homes are feeling the brunt of the downturn, with prices in February falling 6.3%. The worst decline on record. The years long property slowdown has dealt huge damage to the economy, reducing construction business, hitting consumer confidence and exacerbating the debt burden facing local governments, which typically rely on land sales as their major source of revenue. Well, at long last, companies in Japan are finally announcing significant wage increases. As traditional springtime negotiations show Japan is at the end of decades of economic stagnation. Peter Landers is our Tokyo Bureau Chief. We just heard from the largest Union Confederation in Japan that on average major Japanese companies are planning to raise pay by 5.28%. That's the largest raise since 1991, and it's much higher than last year's raise, which averaged out at about 3.6%. So it's a big pay increase. And we've heard a similar story from individual companies such as Nippon Steel, which is raising wages by 14%. Suntory Holdings, the liquor maker, by about 7%. Peter says that recent stock market records have been a boon for companies and reflect the strength of the Japanese economy now, but that it's taken longer for wages to catch up. What we have in Japan now is an economy that's being driven largely by exporters that are benefiting from the weak yen. But most of the Japanese economy is driven by its own consumers, people who live here in Japan, and they have been much more reluctant to spend because their wages in real terms are actually going down. So what we heard from the head of the Union Confederation today is that she thinks that these higher wages will actually help the economy overall by stimulating consumer spending. We are exclusively reporting that a cockpit mishap was the likely cause of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight from Sydney to Auckland suddenly plummeting this week. A flight attendant hit a switch on the pilot's seat while serving a meal, which meant that a motorized feature pushed the pilot into the controls and pushed down the plane's nose. The switch has a cover and isn't supposed to be used when a pilot is in the seat. Some 50 passengers needed medical attention following the incident, with airline Latam saying the jet suffered a technical event during the flight, which caused strong movement. The company said it's working with authorities on the investigation, but has declined to come further. And in another reminder to take what you read online with a grain of salt, a bunch of well-known investors are struggling to get Facebook and other social media platforms to take down posts by impersonators. The fake investing advice from the likes of hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, activist investor, Bill Ackman and ARK Invest's Cathie Wood, aim to scam individuals out of money. And Journal reporter Ben Dummett says that Ackman's Pershing Square has been trying to get those posts taken down but to no avail. What they can do is try to clamp down on these fake ads popping up in order to discourage the scammers from posting these ads in the first place. But regulators have come out and warned investors about this. The hedge funds themselves have told Facebook about this. Facebook claims that it itself is trying to take down these fake ads, and yet they keep reappearing. The only thing you can do is try to get in touch with the hedge funds themselves to see if this is a true ad. Contact Facebook to see if this ad is real or not. Maybe talk to a financial professional to get their advice on the validity of these ads. And that is What's News for Friday morning. Today's show was produced by Kate Bullivant and Charlie Duffield. Our supervising producer is Sandra Kilhof. We will be back tonight with a new show. Otherwise, have a great weekend and thanks as always for listening. A nationwide settlement could change how Americans buy and sell homes. And can Biden and Trump appeal to America's most disillusioned voters, Gen Z? Democrats, in particular, and Republicans need to engage these voters. They need to make sure they turn out because this election is going to be very tight. Plus, Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis can stay on the election interference case against former President Donald Trump now that her deputy has resigned. It's Friday, March 15th. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. If you're looking to buy or sell a home, this story is for you. A groundbreaking settlement announced today could drive down realtor commission rates and force thousands of real estate agents out of the industry. The National Association of Realtors has settled claims that the industry conspired to keep agent commissions high. In the US, that commission is typically 5 to 6% of the purchase price, among the highest in the world. If approved by a federal court, the $418 million agreement changes a couple of things. Sellers who typically pay a buyer's agent now don't have to include in their home listing how much they'll pay, and buyers will now sign agreements with real estate agents on how much to pay them. These would be the biggest changes to how Americans buy and sell homes in decades, and it could mean big savings for both buyers and sellers. Laura, this agreement gives home buyers more power. They can decide whether to use real estate agents and it's easier to negotiate how much to pay them. What does it mean for sellers? From the seller's perspective, it gives them a little bit of flexibility. They can decide if they want to offer compensation to a buyer's agent, \\\"You aren't going to have to pay your agent if you buy this house. I'm going to pay them for you.\\\" But I think it gives them more flexibility than we've seen in the past with also saying, \\\"I want to save on fees, and so I'm not going to offer that.\\\" Laura, the National Association of Realtors is one of the country's most powerful trade groups. What will the settlement mean for the industry? I absolutely think that it is a threat to the industry. It makes it more likely that buyers might opt not to use agents at all, to say, \\\"I'm going to try to save the money.\\\" So, agents are going to have to rethink how they do business a little bit, how they talk to buyers, how they talk to sellers about their compensation. What did the organization say about how the system was working? Their defense of the old system is that it really helped first-time buyers, buyers with more moderate incomes. The fact that the seller was offering to provide the compensation for your agent, it put people on equal footing whether they had just sold a million dollar home or never bought a home in their lives. It could be a challenge for first-time buyers who are now going to have to really commit to paying their agent if the seller doesn't want to. Laura, as our listeners know, we've been covering the ups and downs of the housing market for quite a long time, from higher mortgage rates to record sale prices. Could this settlement change the dynamics of that market? The consumer advocates, the people who are kind of a proponent of these changes, they will tell you this solves all the problems in the world. Right now, one of the big problems we have with the housing market is a shortage of inventory. So, they're going to argue this makes it easier for someone to sell a home, right? They don't have to pay necessarily the same astronomical commissions that they were paying before. So, we might see more inventory come on the market, people be more willing to sell. They've made the argument that home prices will come down and that'll be good for buyers because sellers will have fewer costs in selling a home. That's the sort of optimistic scenario for how this could potentially be good for the housing market. Fani Willis, the Georgia prosecutor who brought a sweeping indictment against former President Donald Trump on charges related to election interference, can remain on the case. A judge ruled this morning that Willis could stay on if her chief legal advisor, Nathan Wade, with whom she had a romantic relationship, resigned. By this afternoon, he had stepped aside. The judge had said their relationship, which has since ended, created an appearance of impropriety. His order is a partial win for defense lawyers who sought to have Willis and the case itself dismissed. Florida is the next state to hold its presidential primary on Tuesday, March 19th. With a general election rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump set, Florida's contest is expected to be a bit sleepy, but the Sunshine State's still a hotbed for the culture wars. Many of the policies pushed by Governor, and one-time presidential hopeful, Ron DeSantis are at the center of those debates, from restricting instruction about sexual orientation in schools to cracking down on drag performances. In our latest episode of Chasing the Base, out Sunday, host Jimmy Vielkind explores how those dynamics are playing out in the Republican presidential contest, and he is back now with a preview of the latest episode. Welcome back, Jimmy. Happy to be with you. All right, so Jimmy, you went to Florida and talked with voters. How are these culture wars playing out among them? Well, generally, when we spoke to Republican voters, they told us that they were supportive of many of the laws that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has pushed, but that these issues just aren't top of mind. One of the places I went was the Florida Strawberry Festival in Plant City. Think of a state fair, only everything is strawberry flavored. Talking to people, they almost always said that their top issues were immigration in the southern border and the economy. When I would ask about culture wars, we had one person who even said, \\\"Oh, they're issues, but they're just not big issues.\\\" Jimmy, a lot of those policies were pushed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who dropped out of the race for the GOP nomination for president back in January. How are Florida voters viewing DeSantis versus former President Donald Trump? Well, that was something I asked, basically, everyone we spoke to. I heard from a lot of people that they really liked Ron DeSantis. They were happy with his record as governor, but they just would've picked Donald Trump over DeSantis in a primary if it were ever to have come to a real matchup. Basically, they really like Trump, and they saw no reason for DeSantis to make a challenge at this time\\u002f they felt that if Trump is elected or if Trump exits the scene, they think DeSantis sits on a very solid foundation for a potential run for the presidency in 2028. Jimmy, how does all of this translate what's going on in Florida to the national level? Well, what's interesting about going to Florida at this moment is you can see some signs that the culture war is starting to ebb. The Florida state legislature just concluded its annual session and many culture war priorities just didn't advance. The other thing that I found is that there are activists who are very engaged in these issues and who are very energized by these issues. It's unclear whether that's going to be a very mainstream focus that is going to insert itself into the national debate or whether it's going to stay more on the edges nationally and be more mainstream in certain states, including Florida, as we'd seen over the last several years. Thank you so much, Jimmy. Thanks, Annmarie. And you can hear the latest episode of Chasing the Base right here in the What's News feed on Sunday. Coming up, from Republican voters to a disillusioned Gen Z. We'll talk about why these young voters are more skeptical and pessimistic than previous generations after the break. We are in the heat of the presidential election season. As my colleague, Aaron Zitner, told us on the show last week, there's a lot of antipathy among voters for either candidate in the rematch set between President Biden and former President Donald Trump. But for a certain generation, the disillusionment is even stronger. Gen Z adults, who were born in 1997 and after, are more skeptical of government and pessimistic about the future than any other generation. That's according to long-running surveys and interviews with dozens of young people across the country. So, how did they get that way? Joining me now with more is our national political reporter, Eliza Collins. Welcome back. Eliza. Good to be here. Eliza, I can remember as a young voter, and now I'm an elder millennial, there was really a mix of people whether they wanted to get politically involved or not, but I didn't go through a global pandemic when I was a young person, and that understandably has had a big impact here. Yeah, absolutely. Young voters generally don't vote at the same rates as older voters. That is true across the board. Like you mentioned, there's usually a mix of people that are involved and also very disengaged. But this group, Gen Z, has really had a tumultuous coming of age. The pandemic for many of them was in high school or college. They were sent home. They couldn't be with their friends. They entered a job market with a lot of uncertainty. A lot of people we talked to were getting unemployment for a year. These voters have come of age in the Trump era. The divisiveness has continued in the Biden era. There's climate change warnings, there are school shootings, the right to an abortion was overturned when Roe v. Wade was overturned. So, there's all of these big, earth-shattering events that have come up as they've grown up, and they just don't feel good about the current state of the world and the future that politicians can help them. With that list you just rattled off, it's understandable. But at the same time, there are some positives, too. The job market's strong. The Biden administration has canceled billions of dollars in student loans. So, what are they looking at that sort of tells them they're not in a good spot? This is sort of this voter disconnect that we are seeing across the board. The economy is doing very well, and yet voters of all ages are not feeling it. But with young voters in particular, you mentioned several things that apply to them directly. But they say that there are a lot of things that are still holding them back. Their credit card and car loan delinquencies are increasing, their savings have gone down in that time, rent has gotten really expensive, inflation has gone down, but the price of food is still up. So, these voters are feeling the economic tensions, even if by most measures, the economy is doing very well. I'm also a millennial, and we entered the job market at a worse time than Gen Z, but surveys show millennials generally felt more optimistic about the state of the world because there had been relative calm until that point. So, the outlook is more positive than Gen Z who have come up just in such an angry, partisan, tumultuous time. How big of a problem is this disillusionment for Trump and Biden, and how are they seeking to appeal to this group of voters? It is a problem for Trump and Biden and all politicians. I would say it is a bigger problem for Democrats because young voters do tend to be more liberal than older voters. That has always been the case. That continues to be the case. But our polling showed that Biden led Trump by just a few percentage points with young voters, which is a problem given how liberal this group is on a lot of issues. They're just disengaged. So, both campaigns say they're targeting these voters using untraditional media sources. The Biden campaign just got on TikTok, which is really interesting because Biden has also said that he'd be willing to sign legislation that would ban or force new ownership of TikTok. So, they're trying to reach these voters. At the same time, they may be trying to limit their media sources. Thank you as always, Eliza. Thank you. Boeing is advising airlines to check the cockpit seats on 787 Dreamliner jets. The planemaker's memo comes after a terrifying incident earlier this week where a seat mishap likely pushed a pilot into the plane's controls, causing a sudden plunge. We exclusively reported in this morning show that the mishap board a Latam flight from Sydney to Auckland was the likely cause of the incident. About 50 passengers on the flight required medical attention. In a statement, Boeing said the latest memo is a precautionary measure and a reminder to operators to follow an earlier service bulletin to inspect and maintain seat switches. An investigation is ongoing, and Boeing said it defers to authorities on any findings. And a tech outage at McDonald's disrupted operations at restaurants across the globe today with some locations unable to open and close stores except credit card payments or receive orders from apps and kiosks. Customers took to social media to complain. McDonald's said the outage was not related to a cybersecurity incident and that it was working to resolve what it described as a computer system outage.

Mitch McConnell says he will not serve as leader in a new Congress next year. There are reports former president Trump favors Montana Senators Steve Daines to be the next leader. But one key senator says Daines already has a critical job leading the Senate GOP campaign arm. Steve Daines has a really important job right now that I think is the most important thing we need to focus on. And that's to actually win the Senate back because I want the next Republican leader be the majority leader. I'm Dave Anthony. 131 years ago today, America's 24th president was sworn in. He only won to do what Donald Trump's attempting. Elected again after being defeated. Grover Cleveland believed in character and he was a straight shooter. He was a reformer. He took on the machine and corruption. He told you where he stood and stood there. There is an ongoing debate in Washington over funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Republicans like Florida Senator Marco Rubio say that's important, but there are more pressing concerns. I believe that we should help Ukraine, but only after we help America through our border. In the same way as Democrats are saying we won't help Israel unless we help Ukraine. And because they're holding Israel as leverage and hostage over Ukraine. The other big news in the Senate is the announcement that GOP leader Mitch McConnell will not seek to be leader in a new Congress next year. McConnell's a Reagan Republican while many of the new or GOP senators are more Trump Republicans like Ohio Senator J.D. Vance. You can't have a Senate Republican leader who seems to ooze hatred and dismay for the very people who vote most of the Republican elected leaders. Florida Republican Congressman Byron Don on slayed out the views of many MAGA Republicans. Let me tell you the truth. Who are MAGA Republicans? They just want the country to follow the law. They want the country to follow the Constitution. They want our leaders to put America first, not last. In terms of the next Senate Republican leader, there are three Johns and perhaps several others likely to seek the top job. John Barras, who have Wyoming, John Cornon of Texas, John Thune of South Dakota. It will be a big change after Mitch McConnell has led the conference since 2007. The longest serving Senate Party leader in U.S. history. Well, look, he's a historic figure. The longest serving Republican leader in U.S. history. You know, I was honored to be part of the Republican Senate class of 2014. You might remember Mike. We were the ones who big class, a bunch of us beat Democrat and convinced to get rid of Harry Reid. Boot Harry Reid is a majority leader and put Mitch McConnell in. Senator Dan Sullivan is an Alaska Republican. I think he's got a strong legacy of accomplishment, particularly when we retook the Senate and made him leader and when the Trump administration got elected on some very important traditional critical Republican priorities, rebuilding our military and readiness after the disastrous Obama years of crushing readiness, 25% cuts to our Department of Defense, second term of Obama, unleashing American energy, which the Democrats always go against. Less government and more freedom, getting rid of regs, lowering taxes, which really supercharged our economy and a generational shift on federal courts in terms of principled texturalist judges, conservative judges, particularly on the ninth circuit, which really, really matters to me being Alaska Senator. And of course, on the U.S. Supreme Court with three Supreme Court justices, one third of the court done under leader, McConnell's leadership working closely with the Trump administration. And then finally, this one I think is also important to others. He protected the institution of the Senate. You might remember Schumer had this ill-conceived power grab a couple years ago to get rid of the legislative filibuster based on this bogus charge that Republicans supported Jim Crow 2.0. That would have made the Senate just like the House. McConnell helped rally not only Republicans, but Democrats against that, which would have, in my view, been a really bad development for the institution of the United States Senate. And then, you know, he has been a strong proponent of the Reagan approach to foreign policy, peace through strengths and resisting calls for America's retreat in the world. You know, I've talked to some liberals in recent days since the news broke and, you know, they don't agree with McConnell on issues, but they seem to respect the way that he led his conference and the way he utilized his power to get important things done, such as those three Supreme Court justices. What about that? Absolutely critical. You know, and to President Trump's credit, they instituted a very serious approach to selecting judges. Conservative, Federalist, Oriented, Texturalists believed in the separation of powers. That was key to have those kind of nominees put forward to the Senate. But, you know, McConnell made some very important leadership decisions as are related to filling the seat or not filling the seat of Justice Scalia, when President Obama was president, of getting not only Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, but Amy Komey Barrett through during some challenging times. And, look, that is a generational achievement that, in my view, will positively impact the country for decades. Let's talk about the next possible GOP leader. Three guys named John are expected to be potentially in the mixed barato, corn in and soon. There's a report that former President Trump is suggesting Steve Daines from Montana potentially run. One would imagine that Rick Scott from Florida would want to run after he challenged McConnell the last time. Do you have thoughts on some of these guys and some perhaps women in the Republican conference who make seek leadership and do you have a favorite? Well, look, every one of those ones you mentioned are good friends of mine. And I think it's great that we got so many excellent Republican senators who are either throwing their hat in the ring or are considering throwing their hat in their hat in the ring. It's healthy. And now is the time to have a good debate on their priorities. Certainly, I'm going to let them know what my priorities are. But I will tell you this. You mentioned Steve Daines. Steve Daines has a really important job right now that I think is the most important thing we need to focus on. And that's to actually win the Senate back because I want the next Republican leader to be the majority leader in the Senate. And that is really the area that I think we should all be focused on because we got a good opportunity to do it. And that should be the priority right now. We're going to have plenty of time to have a good discussion with all these excellent senators you just mentioned. But I think what unifies us, certainly every single one of us is working hard to show Chuck Schumer the door and get a Republican majority leader back in the Senate. You sit on the Armed Services Committee. As I travel around, I've had some people talk to me and say, why does Ukraine matter to the United States? And my thought is the commander chief should probably make a speech to the nation reiterating why Ukraine is important to the United States. But for those type of questions and funding going forward for the Ukraine war, make the case for why we should be strong supporters of Ukraine as it fights Vladimir Putin in Russia. Well, let me just first make the case on the supplemental that we just voted on. Now it's not a perfect bill. But I supported it. And it's a national security supplemental. And I really think that the issue here is you have to look at where we are in the world right now. The reasons I voted for this were generally three main reasons. One is that we are in a very dangerous world right now. What I refer to as the new era of authoritarian aggression led by the dictators, Xi Jinping, Putin, all the terrorist leaders in Iran, and Kim Jong Un. They're working together very closely. If you read the intel on armed services, committee hearings, you can see that. Number two is the Biden administration hasn't taken national security issues seriously. In mind, you at all three years in a row, they cut defense spending. They focus on issues that have nothing to do with lethality and readiness. This year's Biden budget shrinks the army shrinks the Navy shrinks the Marine Corps. That is not the message you want to send to Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. And thirdly, Mike, our ability developed and build weapons to protect ourselves. I'm not talking Ukraine or Israel. I'm talking to protect America has dramatically atrophied. It has a fat, almost 40% of our attack sub-fleet fleet is in maintenance right now. That's the weapon the Chinese fear the most. So what this bill actually does is almost 60% of this bill goes directly into our ability, the defense industrial base of America, to produce weapons, everything from submarines to 155 millimeter ammo. And that's why I'm supporting it. It shouldn't be called the Ukraine aid bill. It should be called the enhancing America's industrial base to defend ourselves bill. And I think that's the key. Now, will some of that be used to get critical weapon systems to allies who are facing existential threats like Taiwan, like Israel, like Ukraine? Yes. And primarily, this is a bill about our capacity, build weapons and produce ammo to defend ourselves. And I think that should be a unifying message for Republicans and I hope it is. And then finally, look, it's a really dangerous world. There's no doubt that the weakness shown by the Biden administration and its botched Afghanistan withdrawal was led to emboldening Putin to undertake his brutal invasion of Ukraine. But I think it's strongly in our national security interests, A, to not let Putin roll over it on Ukraine because then he's going to be facing NATO allies of ours, the Baltics, Poland, Moldova. And this history shows dictators on the march. Their appetite grows after each meal. And then finally, it's this issue of the broader national security context. If Putin rolls over on Ukraine, watch what's going to happen in the Indo-Pacific region. Watch what's going to happen with regard to Taiwan. And this is where some of my colleagues in the Congress are saying, well, we can let Putin have his way with Ukraine. But we're going to be really strong with regard to China and the Taiwan Strait. My response to that is like deterrence is not divisible. American credibility is not divisible. How do we know this? Because in the aftermath of the botched withdrawal of Afghanistan, many of us, myself included, predicted that the authoritarians of the world would move on other countries because they saw so much weakness from the Biden administration. And guess what? That is exactly what happened. So these are all the reasons, the long answer, but it's an important issue. And I do think that even some of the Republicans who didn't vote for the national security supplemental in the U.S. Senate, they weren't driven by saying, hey, I don't want to help you, Ukraine. They were driven more by saying, look, Biden is so fundamentally screwed up, the border, so fundamentally screwed up the execution of this Ukraine war because at every major weapon system he delays. And that was what's driving a lot of that. And I respect those positions. But when it comes to building our own weapons systems to protect us, which is dramatically atrophied in large part because of Biden, we need to take that seriously. And that's why I supported. It's not a perfect bill. The House can make it better. I had an amendment that would have removed all what they call direct budget support. So that's the money that goes to Ukraine just in terms of helping their government keep running. My view is America should be providing Ukraine lethal weapons, energy, which now Biden is not to our allies, which he looks like he's starting to delay Intel in operations, but not direct budget support. The House bill could make this national security supplemental better. And I hope they move on this soon. Underdance, all of them in the great state of Alaska. Grateful for your time, sir.

We appear to be on a collision course for a rematch in November. Trump has now promising a full scale campaign of revenge and retribution his words. So President Biden says it's too dangerous to elect former President Trump again. This is a Biden invasion over the past three years. I call him crooked job because he's crooked. He's a terrible president. Trump was our 45th president and is trying to become number 47. Only one other president has ever returned to the White House. On this day in 1893, Grover Cleveland took office for a second time. Now back then, March 4th was always an auguration day. And Cleveland who was our 22nd president became our 24th. Well, he'd not remembered for much, which is unusual because he actually was a pretty effective president on a limited number of goals. Former senior advisor to President George W. Bush for Deputy White House Chief of Staff. He wrote a book about William McKinley's election in 1896, which was after Grover Cleveland's second term. He was chosen by the Democrats in 1884, not because he was the favorite of the party in Ciders, but because he was a reform-minded governor of the state of New York. He'd been the mayor of Buffalo. He had taken on a public corruption in the form of graft in the machine and he had beaten the political machine in Buffalo and had saved the taxpayers lots of money and used that to vault into the governorship of New York, which was a battleground state. In the gilded age, New York, Ohio and Indiana were the key big battleground states and the biggest of them all was New York. So the Democrats chose him because he was the Democratic governor of the state, with a hope that he would somehow break the 20-some odd years since the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and put the Democrats back in the White House. And he did. Now, in 1884, Cleveland beat Republican James Blaine. And now there was a lot of talk about Blaine being corrupt. The New York world at the time wrote, there are four reasons to support Grover Cleveland. He's an honest man. He's an honest man. He's an honest man. He is an honest man. He was also big on gold standard and he wanted to bring tariffs down. The Democratic Party was the party of free trade. They said the work in man is the person who pays the protective tariffs through higher prices for everything from his coffee to his sugar. But yes, he was scrupulously honest. And Blaine was suspect for dealing in railroad stock. In fact, he was taunted by the Democrats as James G. Blaine, the monumental liar from the state of Maine because he had been held to be lying about a series of incriminating letters that showed that he was not only getting stock from the railroad companies for himself, but was using it to grease the skids with other members of the Senate and the House. Now we fast forward. In 1888, President Cleveland was challenged by a different Republican, Benjamin Harrison, whose grandfather was our ninth president, William Henry Harrison. Benjamin was from Ohio and famously made front porch speeches outside his home. Like in those days, it was not common for a presidential candidate to go out and campaign across the country for himself like now. That was considered unseemly. So President Cleveland didn't do any of that. And in the end, Harrison defeated him, getting more electoral votes, even though Cleveland won the popular vote. Four years later, Democrats nominated Cleveland again and he easily defeated Harrison in their 1892 rematch. So Republicans were the big spenders and large measure because they had to pay out lots of pensions for Union Warvets. President Cleveland defeated Harrison, largely on the basis of the Republican Congress had passed a billion dollar budget. The first time the US government had a billion dollar budget, it was explained by the speaker of the House, Thomas Brackett, Reid of Maine, he said, we passed a billion dollar budget because we're a billion dollar country. By 1890 in the congressional elections, the Republicans were nearly wiped out and by 1892, the country was ready to return Cleveland. But like a lot of people who have held the White House, his second term was deeply unpleasant. He became enormously unpopular. He defended the gold standard as the country fell into an economic collapse in 1892. Many Democrats called for a bi-metallic policy that is to say to monetize silver so that silver could be turned into coins along with gold. And Cleveland was a gold man. He believed that a silver dollar was an inflationary currency that would reduce the purchasing power of working people. And so he vetoed every measure that the Democratic legislature, the Congress sent him on this. So by the time the 1896 election came around, even though we didn't have a provision in place that you couldn't have a third term, the Democratic Party splits apart. A silver movement grows up driven primarily by several Southern senators and they literally take control of the Democratic Party and stayed after state Democratic convention passes resolutions condemning Grover Cleveland, the Democratic president. You know, it's interesting because as he does that and box his own Democrat-controlled Congress, he was like his successor in a way. I mean, McKinley came in. He was elected in 1896, be to free silver candidate William Jennings Bryan. McKinley also was a gold standard guy. Now they differed on the tariff, but Cleveland was like him in that way. Actually, McKinley was, but McKinley didn't want to have the election to be about the gold standard because he had been sort of flirty and earlier in his career with some half measures on silver. And so he was forced into this because the issue became, the other side was for silver. He was mildly for gold. And it was only when two people, the Democratic mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania, who had been the former president of the largest labor union in America and a brash young New Yorker who had come in third in the race for the New York Mayorial Post. Both of these two men began to talk about the gold issue in a way that appealed to working people. One of them, the New Yorker, a young man named Theodore Roosevelt, would show up at rallies with two lows of bread. A complete low, if he said, this is what a gold dollar will allow the working man to buy his family. And then a half a loaf, this is what a silver dollar will be able to buy the working man will be able to buy only half a loaf of bread to feed his family. And so they began to talk about the impact on wages that a silver currency would have. And that's what changed the tone of the election in its direction. And obviously Roosevelt four years later became McKinley's running mate and became president when McKinley was assassinated. Now I want to go back to Grover Cleveland. Now Cleveland is known for a few other things. Obviously, his two terms as president that were not consecutive. He's the only president to ever be married in the White House. He'd been a lifelong bachelor or a long time bachelor who admitted sort of admitted to an affair that had created a child. But he married a much younger woman and it is the social event of the quarter century. I mean, the entire nation is focused on at that point, still somewhat popular president, marrying the vivacious young woman and it is the talk of the country. Francis Folsom, she's the youngest first lady we've ever had. She was only 21. He was 49 when they got married. Yeah. She was the daughter of one of his closest friends and he had known her since she was born and was close to very close to her parents. And of course, this was sort of scandalous. But on the other hand, people had a certain admiration for the somewhat, you know, he was a little bit overweight, a big man and she was tiny and pretty and vivacious and she captivated the country. Another thing that people may not or know, one of his children, Ruth Cleveland, she was born in 1891 in between his two terms as president. She died in 1904 when she was 12 years old. A candy bar comes out about a hundred years ago that we know now as the baby Ruth bar. Right. Candy company claims they named the candy for Ruth Cleveland who had died like 15, 20 years earlier. You believe that or maybe it's more about the baseball player. I think it's more about the baseball player, but you know, pick your story. The, the, the, the bambino or the attractive young woman take, take your choice. Now we of course are in 2024 watching a possible presidential return to office like Cleveland. Donald Trump wants to be president 47. He was our 45th president. Any similarities at all between these two men? Well, no, one is a brash entrepreneur. The other one was a very, I mean, Grover Cleveland believed in character and he was a straight shooter. He was a reformer. He took on the machine and corruption. He told you where he stood and stood there. He was not a particularly effective speaker, but his performance in office as mayor and as governor and then as president caused people to understand and respect the, you know, his uprightness and his firmness and his convictions. You know, this is, this is the only, this is only the second time that a former president is running to try and beat the guy who beat him. But we've had two other former presidents try and run for a second term, albeit not, you know, four years later. Martin Van Buren is defeated for reelection in 1840 and in 1848, he runs again, though he's not at this point. The candidate of the party that he founded, he's considered the founder of the modern Democratic party machine, but in 1848, he runs for president as a third party candidate on the free soil ticket and loses and Millard Fillmore in 1856, who had been the vice president for Zachary Taylor, who died in office and Fillmore had succeeded to the post. He runs eight years later in 1856 as the candidate of the American party. The no nothings, the anti immigrant party. Didn't Teddy Roosevelt run again? 1912? Yeah, and he did run again. You're right. I'm sorry. I left him him out, but you're absolutely right. And of course, gets 88 electoral votes while the incumbent Republican president Howard Taf gets eight, William Howard Taf gets eight electoral votes and 435 go to Woodrow Wilson, who becomes the first Democrat president after Grover Cleveland and is the last one until for FDR in 1932. Back to 2024 Super Tuesday is tomorrow, March 5th. Is this the day for president Trump can essentially lock it up? Do you think? Well, his campaign says that he will have a majority of the delegates by the end of March, and I think that's right. He's got some work to do to unite the party and the question is how good a job is he going to be at that. It's one thing to say, I'm turning my attention to the general election. And I'm healing and uniting the Republican party. But if Nikki Haley goes over 16 on Super Tuesday, then what? Well, she's probably likely to do that. But on the other hand, think about this. People are voting for her not because they think she's going to win, but because they want her to win. This is not game of thrones. This is a democracy. And he's got to take steps to unite the party as previous contenders have done, and face to a tough contest. And having been through this process in 2000 with George W Bush having beaten John McCain, I can tell you, it's not easy, but it's absolutely critical to winning the general election. Great to talk to you. Thanks for bringing us back 131 years. We appreciate it. You bet. Thanks for the trip back in the time, capsule. Here's a look at the week ahead. Tuesday over a dozen states will be voting in their primaries, also known as Super Tuesday. It's when most of the delegates are up for grabs, overwhelming victories for both President Biden and former president Trump could see their nominations all but secure. Also Tuesday trial begins for James Crumbly, his son opened fire at Oxford High School in Michigan in 2021, killing four injuring seven. Crumbly and his wife Jennifer were charged with involuntary manslaughter for not doing enough to prevent the killings. Jennifer was found guilty in all four counts last month. Thursday, President Biden will head to Capitol Hill to give his third state of the Union address fulfilling a constitutional mandate. Alabama Senator Katie Brett will be giving the Republican response. Friday marks the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of MH370. The Malaysian Airlines flight took off from Kuala Lumpur headed to Beijing with nearly 240 people on board. The search for the missing plane became the most expensive in the history of aviation. Jared Halpern and Jessica Rosenthal bring you the results as they happen. Scott Brown. What's on your mind? More than a year after their spy balloon nearly launched an international incident, China hits hit a rough patch, slowing growth and aging workforce and the aftershocks of their zero COVID policies have fueled their economic woes with foreign businesses direct investment falling to a 30 year low. That certain explicable decisions from the White House represent a lifeline to a country who has made no secret of its desire to supplant the United States as the world economic superpower by 2035. In here are three of them. First, President Joe Biden used Super Bowl Sunday to debut as campaign on TikTok. In doing so, he implicitly defied the orders of 34 governors, including many Democrats, who have explicitly banned the app on government devices. That issue are too competing interest, political versus security. On the former Biden is desperate to win over young voters, normally a reliable Democratic voting block, but where recent polls show him behind former President Donald Trump by a considerable margin. Yet there are major concerns about the privacy and data security on TikTok. Not even a year has passed since TikTok CEO faced withering bipartisan criticism from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. His answers failed to persuade lawmakers or the general public, but were apparently enough for the Biden campaign. Second, as Beijing touts its approval of more than 40 AI models for public use in the last six months, the Biden administration wages war on American tech firms. Lena Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, rose to prominence on the political left as an abound critic of free enterprise. And as expected, she has aggressively targeted America's leading tech companies, including landmark and I trust lawsuit against Amazon. In a recent inquiry involving compulsory orders to five tech companies regarding their investments in AI. But she has also broadened her ideological attacks on private businesses to include grocery stores and even sandwich shops. When American companies are getting sandbagged by their own government as their Chinese counterparts gobble up market share, it's a sign of upside down priorities. Finally, as Biden continues to dither on taking executive action on immigration, a jarring report from 60 minutes found that Chinese migrants are the fastest growing group crossing the southern border. According to the US Customs and Border Protection, 37,000 Chinese citizens were apprehended crossing illegally into our country last year. That's a 50% increase from two years earlier. At the same time, FBI Director Christopher Ray is sounding the alarm about China's efforts planting offensive malware inside US critical infrastructure networks, describing the issue as, quote, a scale greater than we'd seen before, unquote, Ray labeled the actions a defining national security threat and laying the groundwork to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right. During his successful campaign to pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill in 2021, Biden used that to warn that China was, quote, going to eat our lunch and quote, it made for a snappy sound by then, but would be better served guiding his administration's policy decisions right now. This is former US Senator and former US Ambassador to New Zealand and Somala Scott Brown.\",\" Sunday March 3rd, 2024, I'm Jessica Brosnthal. In just a few days, 15 states and one territory hold primary elections on what is called Super Tuesday. And while former President Trump will look for continuous victories, Nikki Haley will work to make the margins as tight as she can. This is not necessarily a unified Republican party, and in a normal set of circumstances, a frontrunner would want to try to unite the party. But Donald Trump is not your usual candidate in a whole bunch of different ways. I'm Tanya J. Powers. President Biden will deliver his annual State of the Union address on Thursday evening, touting his accomplishments to millions of potential voters during a high-stakes election year. My hope is that you got a thorough review of the accomplishments of the last year, what the Biden administration has been able to deliver. But with a strong emphasis on the work isn't done. I finished the job. It's Super Tuesday and a few days, 15 states and one territory will hold their primaries, and the results from Iowa's multi-week-long Democratic vote by mail will be revealed. While Biden is favored as the incumbent easily when the Democratic primaries, former President Trump has had a relatively easy go of it in the Republican primaries thus far, racking up wins in six states. Though his former ambassador to the U.N. and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley has stayed in the race, saying after her loss in her home state, I said earlier this week that no matter what happens in South Carolina, I would continue to run for president. Then in Michigan, Trump trounced, winning 68% of the vote to Haley's 26.5%. He called into a Michigan election night watch party supporting him. We're going to make America great and get greater than ever before, and I just want to thank everybody who's been incredible, and I'm so proud of the results of their far greater than anticipated. For example, on a unity ticket courtesy of the centrist No Label's political group, which has said it will make a decision next week about whether to move forward. I have not talked to any other organization. I have not put a second or of thought into an independent run because I'm a Republican. That's what I've always been. I've been a conservative Republican my whole life. I'm not going to switch over and have a Democrat vice vice president. That's not something I would do. Super Tuesday will see many of the delegates allocated. One needs 1,215 to clinch the nomination. Super Tuesday offers 874 delegates. And so far, the former presidents racked up 122 Haley's got 24. And in Super Tuesday's states, Trump far outpoles Haley in Texas, for example, he's at 82% to her 12%. It's 77% to her 15 and a half percent in Colorado. And in Virginia, nearly 80% to 16 and a half percent. Traditionally, Super Tuesday is when the nomination pretty much gets locked up. Jim Guarady is a senior political correspondent at National Review and a contributing columnist at the Washington Post. I think it's safe to say that with Donald Trump having won all of the primary so far, he is extremely well ahead and barring some meteorite strike or health crisis or some other really unexpected black swan scenario. He's going to be the nominee. Now, the interesting question has been, you know, and pretty much since DeSantis dropped out after Iowa, it looked like Trump was extremely likely to be the nominee. And Haley has done reasonably well in New Hampshire and, you know, 40% in South Carolina, her home state, not great, but, you know, she represents anywhere from about 30% we saw in Michigan to probably in somewhere 40 some percent of the party that is not comfortable with Donald Trump that does not want to nominate him for what would be a third time, that, you know, for whatever reason, whether it's reasons of January 6th or the stolen election claims or just the general erratic circus that goes with him, there's a chunk of the party that wants to go in a different direction. The bad news for Nikki Haley is that it's not a majority so far anywhere and it may well not be a majority in any state, maybe in the District of Columbia, but nonetheless, like that's, that's not nothing. And ordinarily, this is the sort of thing you'd want to win is get as many delegates as possible and head into the election and get some sort of consolation price. Jim, what about that? Because in Michigan, Trump won, right? Haley, just like you've noted, has said that as well when you look at the amount by which Trump won an Iowa New Hampshire has signaled that there are plenty of Republicans who do want someone else, but at the end of the day in a primary, how much does that matter? Like how much should we be paying attention to those margins of victory on Tuesday? The big picture, it's not going to change a ton, but I would note that in a normal presidential election in primary environment, usually the frontrunner, when they were underperforming a bit and wanting to unify the party, would want to figure out, okay, how do I get that candidates, you know, supporters to jump on board? And in an ordinary political environment, the frontrunner might look at the runner up and say, hey, why don't I make you my running mate? Well, unite the party and we'll all go on the great victory in November. I don't think that's going to happen. I think it's pretty clear that Donald Trump has said publicly he's not interested in having Nikki Haley as his running mate. Haley has been pretty tough on Trump. For a while, there was a stretch where she was not outright denying it. I think it's safe to say they've the bad blood between the two is probably too much to overcome. So, and we've seen her, she was the, you know, a bastard to the United Nations on the first Trump administration. I don't think she necessarily be interested in any other cabinet appointment or any other gig in a second Trump administration, where I think she, you know, so I'm not sure if there's a clear sense of what exactly Nikki Haley expects to get out of this, but when you do have, as I said, anywhere from 30 to 40% of the party, usually you'd get a prime time speaking gig at the convention. Usually, I reassign that you have some future in the party. Now, I don't know if this is also kind of a glaring warning sign, I think, to the Trump General Election campaign, that there are Republicans out there who are not certain to vote for Trump in a general election, and that his numbers amongst independence, and yes, there have been some crossover votes in places like New Hampshire and South Carolina. I don't think you can dismiss Nikki Haley's numbers so far as just being crossover votes and not something that Trump needs to worry about. And also, by the way, traditionally, you'd like to have some independent votes. You'd like to have some crossover votes as you head into a general election. Look, he's winning. He's got, you know, at this point, 120, 22 delegates and she's got 24. He's going to be the nominee, but this is not necessarily a unified Republican party. And in a normal set of circumstances, a front runner would want to try to unite the party, but Donald Trump is not your usual candidate in a whole bunch of different ways. Yeah. Well, we do know there are places, I mean, a lot of places this super Tuesday holding contest, Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia have open primaries, but even places like Colorado, Maine, and Massachusetts, they're not open for say, but unaffiliated and independent voters to your point. They could choose whichever ballot they want. Given that there are so many super Tuesday votes that are open to some degree, does that vote well for for Nikki Haley? Or have we seen enough like have we, you know, as they as they say, has he seen enough? Is it sort of in the bag as you've already sort of indicated? It probably is only worth a couple percentage points, but I'm sure if you're Nikki Haley, every little bit helps. And yeah, the vote of an independent does it counts as much as a Republican, particularly the general election. So it's not like you want to say, oh, Pishposh, we don't need to worry about those folks. I would note though that one of the things that makes super Tuesday a bit more challenging and why you usually see a front runner solidify their lead on on this is that it's what you know, there's always some candidate who thinks that they can win the nomination through retail, uh, politics and campaigning. That usually means shaking hands and diners and places like Des Moines, Iowa and Manchester, New Hampshire. Well, at some point you stop having one, you know, state per week or one state per, you know, in a period and you got to scale up, you have to compete in, you know, 10, 12, 13, 14 states at a time and you just can't. The only way you can do that, you can, you can, you can only be in one place at a time and you need TVS and Haley's got a decent funding for a second place candidate, but I think this is where it will probably catch up to her. But again, the number of Republicans and, and, and independent who aren't comfortable with Trump so far has been around 30% as a, as a floor. I think you'll probably see a lot of that on super Tuesday. And so she'll come out of this with a decent chunk of delegates, not enough to really challenge Trump for the nomination, but it's a better consolation prize than a version of our home game, so to speak. Let's talk about some of the states. I wonder if one of the more interesting states to watch Tuesday and you can tell me if I'm wrong, will be North Carolina. If we're looking for T-Leaves, like to see the margins, Trump only beat Biden by a little more than a point in 2020. He beat Clinton by three and a half points in 2016. I wonder if there's interest not only in the margin between Trump and Haley, but how many Democrats bothered to take the time to vote for Biden? Like, is that of interest and will people be looking at those numbers? I know people will be shocked that there is not enormous interest in the Democratic primary. All those Dean Phillips listeners out there who are diehard Dean Phillips fans, but yeah, the other thing that Haley has going for her is that Democrats, they may have all kinds of misgivings about Biden. They may tell pollsters that he's old, but so far, there's been no sign that they're willing to unite behind Phillips or are Mary and Williamson apparently jumped back in in a demonstration of how to sex or she is. And yeah, look, so the Democrats are like, I can either vote for Biden in a primary way, I already know where it's going to be, or I can make this gesture of opposition to Trump by voting for Nikki Haley. And I think you'll see that in a bunch of those states. North Carolina is interesting. The Biden campaign is convinced that they're going to make this competitive state in 2024. It was close in 2020, but I would note that Republicans tend to win. They have a Democratic governor. They, you know, Democrats, John Edwards, you know, they can win every once in a while, but this is a generally a red state. I would be very surprised. And I also see like, you know, from what I'm hearing about Georgia, it was, you know, Biden won very narrowly last time. I don't know if you'd say 2020 was ideal circumstances for Joe Biden, but I think it's safe to say that Joe Biden is less popular today than he was back in 2020. And I think, you know, of all the ones that were narrow, you know, Biden wins last time, I think Georgia looks like one that's most likely to flip. So I, you know, the other thing we should keep keeping an eye on is just total number of turnout in these primaries. Our Republicans fired up an enthused or is there, you know, Iowa had the caucuses had a significant drop. Now caucuses are a little bit different. I was there and it was negative eight. Yeah, terrible weather. I was there the week before. Apparently the snowiest week they'd had in Iowa in 40 years. They saved it all up for when I was arriving. So there's reasons. They think, okay, maybe you, maybe it's possible that one out as an outlier. But I think, look, there's, it'll be interesting. The other thing which I've, it's been on my mind. I'm a resident of the state of Virginia. Yes, I was just going to ask about Virginia. Yes. Sure. So last time around, you may recall, when I say last time, 2016, not 2020 when it was actually a fairly competitive Republican primary well into the contest. This was, I believe, it's not the first, it was, you know, the first really big state that Marco Rubio had won. I think he might have won Minnesota as well. But in other words, it was a, you know, there's, it's a little bit of an outlier. Northern Virginia is a, people think it was being heavily democratic. Now you look back at the governor's race is Bob McDonald, most recent, the Glenn Youngkin, a Republican can either, if they don't win Northern Virginia, they can like keep it close. And then you clean up in Southern Virginia. So if Nikki Haley is running for more of a white collar professional old-fashioned, Mitt Romney, button down, you know, establishment Republican, Northern Virginia is where, where you're going to find those. So I kind of wonder if Virginia is one of her better shots. Again, he would not surprise me if Nikki Haley did not win any states in this primary. And I believe that somebody said the RNC has rules where you got to win at least five states to be the nominee. So at some point, like, it's not just this one, she's got to find other ones to have a serious shot at being the nominee. Right. Whether or not her campaign wants to admit she's running a protest campaign, that's kind of what she's doing right now. But as far as I'm concerned, that's fine because as noted, there's about a third of the party that wants to vote for somebody not named Donald Trump. Okay. So then to that point and to wrap things up, after her, after her South Carolina speech, you see lost, right? And then she said, but I'm not going anywhere. And I heard some pundits say, oh, that sounds like a no-label speech. You know, that sounds like she's sticking in no matter what. And she told our own Martha McCallum, I'm not interested in a unity, unity ticket. I'm not going to have a Democrat as my vice president. I'm a Republican. But what is that should we be on the lookout for her to make some sort of path for herself beyond Super Tuesday? I know no labels has said, well, we'll figure things out after Super Tuesday, right? That's that was their sort of marker of time, time limit their benchmark. So what I guess what happens after Super Tuesday, or I imagine it depends. But if things seem like relatively a foregone conclusion here, then what do you think is going to happen after Super Tuesday, whether it's no labels, Nikki Haley's path, and Trump being in court? I'm glad you asked about that because as you noted, no labels seems very interested in Nikki Haley. The other names that have been mentioned around, Joe Manchin says he's not interested in running for president in 2024, the Democratic Senator from West Virginia. Now, I suppose he could change his mind on that, but he seemed pretty definitive in that. Larry Hogan, the former Republican governor of Maryland, a lot of people had been talking about him being a potential part of a no-label ticket. He's running for Senate in his home state of Maryland. So he's off the list. So you look at all that, and you're like, okay, well, Nikki Haley might be one of the certainly she's got name recognition. Certainly she's demonstrated she can get people to vote for her in, you know, not winning numbers, but significant numbers in these primaries. And she would make a attractive prospect for no labels if they want to be seen as a serious player in the 2024 election. But there is a challenge. One of the problems is that there are several states that have a, with a call, sore loser laws, in which if you've lost a primary for a major party, you're not allowed to run as an independent or as the nominee of another party. Some of these states are really big meaty ones where you'd expect to be, you know, a lot of competition. Michigan is one of them. And also, I, you know, we talked about this a bit earlier. One of them's her home state of South Carolina. And the other one is her Georgia, which you I mentioned, like these are big states you'd usually like to compete in. Now, I've, there are some people who argue that these sore loser laws are unconstitutional because the constitution lays out what the criteria is to be president and that states can't put on additional criteria. So I imagine people would want the Supreme Court to weigh in on that quickly. So this is a little bit of an X factor. The, if you're no labels on the one hand, you've got Nikki Haley with this high name recognition and proven ability and a fan base and all that. But on the flip side, do you want to compete in just 42 states instead of 50 because of these state laws that would theoretically bar her for running as a no labels candidate. So it'll be interesting. I'll be keeping an eye on that as well. I, the other thing which is worth noting is that if, you know, it's one thing, Rikki Haley to say, I don't want to do that. It's another thing when you're actually offered and with no labels is, hey, we've actually gotten on the ballot in a whole bunch of places. We're willing to finance a serious independent, you know, third party bid for you. It's another thing to turn that down. So we'll see how it shakes out. But I think this is not we have not heard the last word on this subject. Is it only 14 states so that they've qualified for no no labels thus far? It's not it's not. Yeah. I'm a pro jumped in late and managed to get on the ballot. You know, I think just about all 50 states. So conceivably, I think they can do this. I mean, RFK is also getting on a bunch of them. So, you know, yeah. But I believe by the way, some of the states they've gotten on are the states that they would bet the states where they are on the ballot are states where there are also sewer loser laws. So an interesting question is you put all that effort to get on the ballot and then you nominate somebody who's ineligible. I think that would be a perfect irony, I suppose. Interesting. Jim Garrett, senior political correspondent at the National Review and a contributing columnist at Washington Post. Thank you so much for joining. Always enjoyed, Jessica. Thank you. And don't forget to spread the sunshine. Thank you. President Biden will deliver his annual State of the Union address on Thursday evening, where he's expected to touch on a range of topics, including infrastructure accomplishments and getting rid of junk fees. But President Biden's team is hoping to turn the prime time event into a message to voters, showing them why he is the right and stable choice for the country. As recent polls have shown, many voters are concerned about the current president's age and critics of the president are anticipating an uphill battle for the commander-in-chief as he faces multiple issues, including a crisis at the southern border, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the complicated aid package yet to pass for allies in Israel. The speech will be delivered two days after Super Tuesday during a high-stakes election year. So what can voters expect from President Biden's address? My hope is that you got a thorough review of the accomplishments of the last year, what the Biden administration has been able to deliver. But with a strong emphasis on the work isn't done. Right, finish the job is the kind of tagline with all of this. And we'll see how much they use that going into the campaign. But for now, we're working with finished the job. Jessica Tarlov is a Democratic strategist and co-host of the five. And there is still a lot more work to do. I think specifically the president will focus on the economy. What has been accomplished, what is yet to come, especially as a lot of his big policies that he was able to get past, come into play, what the inflation reduction act is getting you, what the American Rescue Act has been getting you for the average American. And then my expectation, building off of his trip to the border is that there will be a discussion about the bipartisan border deal, how it's imperative that we pass it, and how important that issue is to Americans left, right, and center. So those are kind of the buckets, the economy stuff that I'll really want to focus on. And then the stuff that he wants to focus on a little bit less with what's going on with illegal immigration, but is a must, plus the usual tones of, we've got to keep democracy alive. And then of course reproductive rights, which has been a focal point for Democrats and has really just turned out, every time it's been on the ballot since the DOPS decision. Oh, absolutely. You mentioned some of the past accomplishments that his White House has had, the messaging for a lot of this does not seem to be sticking with the general public at all. How is he going to break through and go, no, no, we've really done some stuff, y'all. Yeah, I think, well, in general, the economy usually takes six months to a year for people to actually start feeling good about it. That's just kind of a historical trend with all of this. And you are seeing an uptick and optimism about people's finances for the next year. We know about the consumer sentiment index shooting up, I think, by the highest percentage since 2005, which obviously a big deal. But I think that the administration really needs to focus on talking about individual policy rather than the fancy name for all of it, right? Like, Bidenomics was a bit of a failure, right as a term. And they have shied away from using it now. And now they're talking about practical things like Medicare recipients. Now they're insulin is $35 a month. They want to expand that to everyone. Republicans had blocked that Biden administration says we've got to do that. Talk about access to rural broadband. That's a huge deal. Talk about the brass tax of what the infrastructure deal has gotten people like, are your roads better? Are your airports better? Manufacturing jobs. I was at a chips factory. This is not me. I'm being the president now, but you're saying I was at a chips factory in Texas. These are the amount of jobs that we brought to X community. So kind of making it discernible little pieces versus these kind of big umbrella terms like IRA. That's not going to work for people as well as your prescription drugs cost less because of Democrats. One of a couple of the other things that I expected, and I want to get your take on this, is of course the situation with Russia and Ukraine, the invasion of Ukraine, just past its two-year anniversary, as well as the war in Gaza. We've learned that he said the US is going to start air-dropping humanitarian aid into Gaza. That is obviously a huge topic. What do you expect him to say on those two fronts? Well, I assume that he will talk about Alexei Navalny again. Absolutely incredible to see millions risking God knows what kind of punishment from the Russian government to come out and to see the casket drive by. So he'll talk about that again. He'll talk about how important this aid is, and that Democrats are waiting to sign, whatever deal can be brought to them. I don't think because it's the state of the union that it will be as antagonistic as a regular day where he'll call people out by name and say, Speaker Johnson said he'd do this, but he hasn't been able to because Matt Gaetz is a lunatic or whatever he's going to say. But he will definitely make it clear that these fights for democratic countries, and that will include Israel as well, are important to us and to our safety and to the safety of NATO countries. Talk about what a big deal it is with Sweden passing that final hurdle, going through Hungary to be able to join. And then I do expect on the Israel front that he will talk about what's going on in Gaza and make a plea not only to return the hostages, but for us to be cognizant of the humanitarian disaster that's going on there. So preserving democracy, bringing the hostages home, but also highlighting that things are a little bit different than they were back in November, December. I know that he'll call out Netanyahu by name in any way, but there will be an implication that things have gotten kind of out of control there. The pressure that is now on, of course, the president for ceasefire, which if you've watched the footage of protests, there have been so many of them that have really kept the pressure up. And as well as in the Michigan primary, just a few days ago, we saw with the uncommitted voters trying to send a message to him about how they feel about his policies there. Totally. I mean, I happen to think that the Michigan primary was not that big of a deal in terms of Biden's campaign or his electability come November 5th. There's always, you know, Obama got a 10% uncommitted vote in 2012. This was also much higher turnout. I think it netted out at about 13% right was the total. So I think people will come home ultimately, especially when the candidate on the other side as someone who would reinstate a Muslim ban. But it's definitely something that's top of mind for the administration. No doubt about that. For those of us who got our state of union knowledge from West Wing reruns, talk to me a little about what goes into creating this speech. This is a usually a long speech. It is about an hour. Yeah, I mean, it's comprehensive. There's a lot as we've already talked about. There's a lot of different things that are probably going to get packed into this. This is not something they started writing yesterday. No, no, definitely not. I mean, the last few days is obviously like trying to go at warp speed right and to integrate everything that's current. But no, it's a long process and it builds off of themes that you've seen show up throughout the campaign. That's why you particularly want to highlight protecting democratic norms, protecting freedoms and stuff like that. But this has been in the works for a long time as with any other presidency. And he'll just be doing the tweaks. The last final day is for whatever is particularly relevant for the moment. You mentioned, okay, you mentioned the campaign. This is for all intents and purposes, you know, a message to the country where he, as it always has been, let's everybody know, hey, here's how we're doing. This is what's going on. How much of this is a campaign speech as well? He isn't incumbent. So he doesn't have tons of formidable challenges or anything. But how much of this is going to be the state of the union as to how things have been going versus, here's another reason why you should vote for me? I think that it's always implicit. And I mean, people generally don't like it when you use the state of the union to campaign. And obviously there are resources issues with that as well, right? Campaign employees are different from the folks that work within the White House. But it is always the template for what the campaign is going to look like. And there have been a lot of accusations that the Biden team has been very slow to launch a full scale campaign. And so this is an opportunity to kind of juice that up as well, to show him being presidential, to show him being coherent for an hour. Remember, it's always the time where even Republicans have to admit that Biden seemed better than they expected because this is also his element. He's with his people. A lot of them have been served with for decades. He's shaking hands kissing a baby. If there's a baby there, I remember a Congressman Mike Garcia had his baby and Biden was all over that. That was two city unions ago or a joint session of Congress. So I think it will be particularly meaningful for a president where everyone is paying attention to his mental acuity, his competency, his ability to deliver something like this. And that's for Democrats and Republicans alike. I'm sure this is a tall order no matter who you are. If you're in charge of writing the state of the union, if you're one of the communications persons or the person writing it or the whoever. But how tough a cell is this to get across to the American people with poll numbers, job approval numbers that we've recently seen for the president? It's really weird because I don't feel like Biden's numbers necessarily mean as much as they have for former presidents. Some of them we just haven't seen before, right? Like his disapproval has gone higher than five or six like going back to Jimmy Carter, which is obviously not a good thing. And there has been a slew of polling specifically in swing to states that shows the Biden isn't in not as good positions, certainly as he was going into 2020. But then you also on the other hand, see how amazingly successful Democrats have been in the Biden era. And I understand that it's not Biden's name on the ticket. And that makes a big difference just like it will when people show up and they see Donald J Trump, right, written on the ballot. But these people, these other Democrats are running on the Biden record. They are touting the accomplishments of this administration. They are talking about the values of this administration and of this president. And so I do consider him to be a bit further ahead than looking at the real clear politics average would necessarily indicate. It's always interesting to me to watch the state of the union, not just for the speech, but for the reactions. And we're going to get to that in just a second. But also for the guests, because it's always I think it's interesting to see who they decide to to bring in to help. I guess highlight parts of the speech, right? Any idea who we expect to be one of the guests for this? I know that or at least it was rumored. I'm not sure if it's confirmed Kate Cox, a woman who wasn't able to get the abortion care that she needed in Texas, is one of the guests. I imagine that there will be someone there who are even the undocumented community, probably both on the NGO side. And then potentially, which would be something that I think quite helpful, someone who has been negatively affected by the migrant crisis. We have that terrible tragedy of the University of Georgia student who was murdered last week by an undocumented man from Venezuela, who was released into the US in 2022, because we didn't have the space to keep him. I think that will be, you know, specific people who have benefited from the core planks of the inflation reduction act, for instance, talk about prescription drug prices. But I think reproductive rights is definitely going to be a huge focal point of who is there. So kind of, and I mentioned just second ago that I wanted to get back to the reactions, because that's the other thing I kind of like to watch for is, you know, obviously the Democrats are going to be on their feet cheering and clapping and whatnot. I'm sure whenever there's a point made, is it, is it possible at all that everybody would clap at anything all at once? It's tough, because even if it's one of those olive branch things, where it's clearly something that's going out to Republicans, then left wingers can't really upset about it. So I don't know, and I don't know if Biden has ever had one. Has he? I don't know. I mean, general, these these days, the idea of getting red and blue to all clap at the same thing is, it sounds like quite the goal. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure. But I always like to see how how the other side is going to react whenever, you know, like I said, a point is made and, you know, it's, there's usually, it's usually a study in opposites. But who knows? Who knows? He might pull it off this time. Is there anything else about the state of the union that just casual viewers may not realize or know about that you find interesting about watching this? What do you watch for? I do watch for the reactions, because like you, it's also just a lot of fun to see the sour poses and the really happy folks. I like watching the Supreme Court justices, the Zee if they ever break character, for the ones who attend. And I guess I doubt Clarence Thomas will come, but I feel like everyone else might, right? It's the usual. I feel like the new ones definitely want to go. Like Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh. Gorsuch feels like a middle termer to me at this point, because he was the first appointee, but he usually goes. So maybe, maybe it will be eight of nine that turn up, which is something. I find that interesting. And then also how my Johnson will behave, you know, this is his first state of the union. There's the famous clap, the Nancy Pelosi. Yes. Sack of Donald Trump's hand. I don't think my Johnson has that in him, but those kinds of moments, I think are really quite interesting. Also, I tend to pay attention to what Klamala is doing, and how in sync she is with the president. A lot of the feelings about him, both positive and negative, are rooted in emotions about Klamala. So I think in that way, she's quite an important person for all of this. And then, of course, your question a few moments ago, you know, who the guests are, what representatives or people they came with, you know, that kind of stuff is always interesting and to learn about the stories, you know, because some of them you'll know, because it'll have been a huge story, but some of them are, you know, the small business owner right in X place that was able to get their student debt forgiven. That's another thing I should have said. I think the student debt relief will also be a focal point of all of this. And of course, there will be the Republican. It's not called the rebuttal. It's from the Republican side on that. Oh, no, no, no claps from that. But they're going to have they'll have a speech afterwards to kind of. Yeah, Katie Brass. Yes, yes, doing it. Which is a big deal, you know, she's new. And also, all eyes on Alabama about the IVF decision. So I think it is interesting that they chose her for this. She's definitely, you know, a star in the making. But it does draw attention, at least commentary wise, to one of the biggest kind of cuntles around Republicans next at this point, which is what's going on with dogs and now shifting that over to are all of these embryos and freezers all over the country going to be at risk. Thank you so much, Jessica. It's been really nice to talk to you today. I appreciate your talk to you too. Thank you for having me. Until then, thanks for listening. I'm Tanya J. Powers from Washington. Far too often, women's lives are cut short as they fall victim to unthinkable crimes, but each week this month I'll be joined by women who fought back, survived, and took back control. You won't want to miss this month's stories of survival, strength, and resilience.\",\" I'm Charles Payne. I'm Martha McCallum. Friday, March 15th, 2024. I'm Chris Foster. 2020 now, 2024. And again, Biden versus Trump. And if the vote were held today at the polls are right, Trump wins this time barely. There is a segment of Trump voters that says if he's convicted on a felony charge, I may rethink my vote. And in something this close, that could actually make the difference. Elisabeth E is a mental health crisis pushing parents away from parenting. Our default must be with kids. You're going to be just fine because if they hear that, they're much more likely to realize it's true and they're much more likely to develop the internal resources to make it true. And I'm Olivia Crochuk. There's Republican caucus in the Northern Mariana Islands today, Guam tomorrow, and primaries for both parties in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio on Tuesday. Well, those people can vote for whoever they want. President Biden and former President Trump already have enough delegates to be nominated at their party's conventions this summer. Trump put out a video on truth social after going over the top Tuesday night. Now we have to get back to work because we have the worst president in the history of our country. His name is Joe Biden. There's a time Florida governor, Ron DeSantis was ahead over close to Trump and Republican primary polls. Then he and everyone else went away only Nikki Haley hung on through Super Tuesday. It is the legal trouble that it seems like helped seal the deal for President Trump. And he rightly predicted that it was going to help him. Would it forced everyone of his opponents to do was to run to his defense every time there was a new round of charges that were leveled. So it really was been kind of impossible primary situation for everybody but President Donald Trump. 234 days to election day. Lock and happen. At the moment, it looks like a very close race again with former president. If you just go by the current polling, it looks like former president Trump, if you go state by state, it looks like he wins a very close race in the electoral college, maybe by ten or so votes. But again, I don't know what that means at this point, but it's interesting. It is. And what's also interesting is as much as we love to dig inside the numbers, there is a segment of Trump voters that says if he's convicted on a felony charge, I may rethink my vote. And in something this close, that could actually make the difference. Now, whether any of these trials gets that far gets to a conviction in a central proven guilty, maybe he's never convicted on any of these charges, but that's a real political liability for him at this point. So for now, all the political gambles are paying off. His rallies are huge. His turning out, they see these not only as prosecutions, but persecutions. So it's working at this point for him. He's one delays in the cases he needs to win delays in. There are more to come. It's just such a tightrope act that he's walking, but he could walk it right back to the White House. How's the money, you know, President Biden has raised a bit more money than former president Trump? Where is he there? Is the deficit enough to make a difference, do you think? Well, they're starting to be chatter that it could be. You know, there are questions about now that he's officially the guy. There's been this whole shake up at the RNC. His daughter-in-law is one of the co-chairs now, Laura Trump. And she, as an individual, is a very sharp smart person. She's a great advocate for him. But the fact that his family is now in some sense running the RNC, there are questions about whether it can pull together the money to also continue as PACs are helping him and others, try to get across the finish line because so much money has been spent on legal fees. And now when you're getting into a general election where President Biden hasn't really had to spend a lot of money on anything. He hasn't had really serious primary challengers. And they are excited. They feel like their coffers are full that they're going to outspend. Trump everywhere they need to. And the president himself is out there in these swing states trying to get it done on the ground too. I suspect that you may see a somewhat nast year attack from the Biden campaign this time around. Not that they didn't, we know that they weren't completely on the attack on the attack in 2020. But I wonder if it's going to get more personal. Where you're going to see videos of Trump stumbling and bumbling over his words every now and then forgetting his words now and then trying to draw it trying to just compare like, hey, you're talking about me. Let's look at this guy too. I do think it's beyond political differences. I think it is very personal for these guys. The president does not love that Hunter has been drawn into a lot of things. He's very defensive of his son. I think he directly blames Trump for that. And so these guys have a lot of personal heat and venom between them. And I do think you're right that these campaigns. And because they have such a long general election campaign period, I think that there's just going to be more and more time for this to get uglier. And everyone's going to be way more bruised by the time we get to the finish line in November. I turned into the Capitol. Colorado House Republican Ken Buck says not only is he going to just retire. He's not even going to finish his term. He's going to quit by the end of next week. That makes their Republican majority even that much smaller. They can now only lose two votes if everything goes party line from now on. As if the speaker did not need more headaches. I mean, trying to hurt the cats is always difficult. But when you only have a couple cats that are in play every single time. And you've got a larger number of cats who don't like anything that you're doing, even though you're in the same party, really difficult. I mean, the Democrats had to do this with the progressives, with the squad trying to keep everybody on the same page is really tough. And so you've got factions, of course, within the Republican party who are demanding that when it comes to spending in the border and everything that Republicans are rolling over if they don't get everything they demand. But when you only have a two vote leeway, it is really difficult. There is chatter that more resignations could be coming. Is it possible that enough Republicans that it won't take many enough Republicans are sick of their jobs that could that they would actually allow their party to become the minority in the house? I think there's enough of loyalty to the party that you don't lose a couple more and wind up in the minority. It also gives them enormous power to try to extract things from the speaker from others in leadership when they're unhappy. So really tough problems for the GOP all the way around. But I don't see them giving up seats that would leave them with nothing to cling to that the GOP controls in Washington. There's a special election for in New York for a seat that was occupied by Brian Higgins, a Democrat. Now that's April 30th. If Democrats regain that seat or take another Democrat wins that seat, then it becomes even smaller than it becomes 218 to 214. That could hold until this special election for Buckeye comes up in June. There's some intrigue there explaining the whole Lauren Bobert situation. She's not happy. I mean, there are so many nightmares in New York. Republicans and she has been a firebrand and she has had plenty of controversy and the voters out there seemed not as enamored of her the last time around when she had to run again. So all of the timing of this and Buckeye leaving and her district changing creates all kinds of new headaches for the GOP. So can they pull it together and keep it together through the summer? Now none of us think they're going to get major legislation done, but they do have to get things done like funding for Israel funding for Ukraine. They have to make decisions on those fronts they're not going to get a big immigration bill done no matter what happens with these special elections, but they do have other stuff that got to get across the finish lines, including those appropriations bills too. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. back in the news this week running as an independent. Now he was a Democrat. He is a Democrat, but he's running as independent. There's talk of him choosing New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rogers as a running mate. Now at first, wow, that seems weird. But then you think about it. Why not? I mean, they're both famous guys. They're both sort of politically offset it with some provocative views. It might be a good match. It might be. And you know, if RFK Jr. alone, the Kennedy name wasn't enough star power for you, you bring somebody in like Aaron Rogers who again, very controversial people love or hate him. And I got to say when I watched, but you know, they did the preseason hard knocks thing with whatever with the NFL teams. And I watched Aaron Rogers. I was like, huh, this guy is more likeable than he's been portrayed in the media. Now I think most mainstream media hates most of his positions. And you know, I'm not defending any of them. And I don't know all of them. But he has a certain following that is really into him. And it would definitely generate star power for the ticket. But the question is, does it become too much of a gimmick? I don't know. We got a couple weeks to wait and find out. I should have the TikTok vote to ban it in the house if it's not sold by his Chinese ownership was not close. 352 to 65. I wonder if this classified briefing the other day, the day before the vote can convince more people that TikTok is a national security threat. Well, think about it coming out of committee 50 to nothing with this fully bipartisan vote. Like nothing gets out of committee 50 to nothing, even like naming a post office. I feel like you got 49 to one. Like there's somebody. So there is very serious alignment on this. But you do have critics pushing back, including on both sides of the aisle who have real questions about the longer term implications of the government getting to make decisions about which social media platforms do and don't survive. I mean, those are real questions the far left and far right have. But the fact that this thing is barreling to the house floor gets through there. And it's interesting to me that President Trump, you know, he gets credit or blame however you look at it for killing the Senate deal that was coming together on the border. But it's interesting that most people don't seem to be listening to him on this TikTok thing. The people who have had to vote on it so far are convinced there's got to be that divestiture. Now that you got to be in the the app, but there's got to be that divestiture regardless of what President Trump is saying publicly. I mean, the people behind TikTok have long denied that we're a tool the Chinese government party. They've said we've never shared user data from Americans with Chinese authorities. And if they asked us, we wouldn't do it. But there are plenty of people who say that well, yeah, you're full of it. And that there is evidence that you've, well, and isn't it, and I'm no Chinese law expert, but this is the argument I always hear is that by law these Chinese companies do have to share their data. They cannot block it from the Chinese government. If that is the case, then bite dance who owns TikTok cannot make that argument. So they may say, oh, it's stored in a different place and the Chinese government can't get to it. But my understanding is by law Chinese government, the Chinese government has to have access to it. Now if bite dance can show that's not true. That's an inaccurate report. Here's how we siphon and silo the information. So it never gets to them. Whatever arguments they've made on that so far have not convinced the people who've seen the classified briefings on this. Any sense of where the sentence is going to go with it. If it all even come up soon or if there's momentum for a vote for against or not of Odal, we'll say, but I've had senators from the left and the right, GOP, Democrat, on the show numerous times to say, we are committed to getting this done in a bipartisan way. You've got Senator Warner out there cheering in the intelligence committee and working with Rubio as the ranking member. I have had a number of senators telling me we're doing this. Now whether they really mean it because it's sort of like the house has given them this vehicle like, okay, do you mean it now? Sort of like when the GOP said we're going to repeal Obamacare and then when they got the chance, they didn't, we'll see because the Senate is now on deck and they've been given a vehicle to get it done this time. You can also hear Shannon on the live in the green podcast, Shannon Breene. Good to talk to you. Thanks. Chris, great stuff to you. I found a lot of ways around rules and versus learning how to be an empathetic person and think about consequences. I just became a really good liar and really sneaky. Parents like their parents are wagging the tail. We want them to know that it's okay to make mistakes. The National Institutes of Health says nearly one in five children, ages three to 17 in the US, having mental, emotional, developmental or behavioral disorder. That 2022 report, also finding a more than 40% jump in suicidal behaviors among high school students in the decade before 2019, trends that only got worse during the pandemic. This also means more kids receiving treatment for disorders. We've addressed some of these serious issues many times on this podcast. Today, we had a different perspective to the mix as some parents try to navigate very challenging times with a more gentle approach to raising kids. Gentle parenting has been a fad now for at least 20 years and it's the therapeutic approach to parenting where kids' feelings are always front and center. Abigail Shryer is an independent journalist and author of bad therapy. Why the kids aren't growing up and you're always soliciting a child's feelings, considering their feelings and the parent avoids all punishment, tries never to say no and instead tries to coax a child along through a series of options and consideration of how they're really feeling. I don't think it's particularly helpful, but if you go on the parenting chat sites where people have tried this and the kids get more and more and more violent, it'd be hilarious if it weren't also a little tragic. Some people from older generations say we're definitely too soft on kids now. Others say some adjustments were needed that parents were too heavy-handed in the past. Have we just gone too far in the other direction? There's actually incredible research on this going back to the 1950s. It's put out by a woman named Diana Bommer and they have repeated her studies over and over. These are very replicated studies. They're very sturdy psychological studies finding that parents who are authoritative but loving have clear rules but are loving. Their kids have the lowest rates of anxiety, least depression, they're happiest and they are most connected to their parents. In terms of they feel a lot of love for their parents and tend to be pretty successful. That is actually what the research shows. What's popular? What's popular is very different. What's popular is to say that all punishment is cruel, that high expectations are too demanding and that all of it is authoritarian and somehow backwards and causing children emotional trauma. It's not true, it hasn't been true and unfortunately it's not helpful that we're putting this really untrue message into the parents' undermine their confidence. My grandmother used to always say discipline is love and I mean there are varying degrees of discipline obviously but that seems to go along the lines of what that research is saying. How has parenting changed over the generations and how much of that has to do with life in general changing? Both parents having to work for instance. I really think our attitudes changed largely because we decided Gen X went into therapy in greater numbers than previous generations and they liked therapy for themselves and they started worrying that they had had emotional trauma of various kinds and they became determined to make sure their kid never had any distress and that's what we're seeing. We're seeing this dramatic over correction in which kids are tried to keep in this happy state. We're trying to keep them in a permanently happy state at all times and these kids have now grown up. They have almost no ability to get past any discomfort and they're always considering their feelings and it's making them miserable. I know in the course of your own research and in writing your book at therapy you've spoken to many families, kids, therapists. Your book raises a lot of questions about how kids are being diagnosed and treated. Are you skeptical of the basic premise that there's a youth mental health crisis or just about the way it's being handled? It's a great question. So there are basically two crises going on at the same time that we might be talking about. One is the very real crisis on our streets. We have an underserved under-treated population. There's no doubt and some of them are very young but they absolutely need serious mental health care and we have also kids with things like severe anorexia who absolutely require treatment. But then there's the larger cohort and they're getting the vast majority of our resources. These are bummed out kids. These are warriors. These are kids who are a little to one side of the general spectrum of humanity. They're not enough to actually have a serious disorder but nonetheless they're getting flooded with diagnosis and treatment and it's counterproductive. It's making them sick. What's your advice then to parents trying to make the right call on who to ask and what to do? Especially when it isn't an obvious case of a child who's suicidal for instance. Right. So number one parents need authority because they won't be able to make any of the changes in their kids' lives until they have comfortable exerting their own authority in the home which doesn't mean being cruel or unloving. It just means I'm in charge and I know what's best for you. Then they need to go in and subtract all the things that are making kids miserable like the too much social media like the constant neurotic monitoring we're doing of their every move never giving them independence never giving them chores. Kids need to feel competent in the world right now they don't feel they can make a difference in the world and they were not giving them skills. They need to take risks. They need dangerous play. It makes them stronger and more confident that they know what they can handle. A walk home from school or from the school bus. Those things are really good for kids. It makes them feel competent. It makes them feel that they can handle a certain amount of danger and they need extended family. People who love them and they love back over time not hired monitors. You know the supervisors hired by mom the coaches who are there because they're being paid. I mean people who love them and they love back over time that's so good for kids. Another thing is telling them with their own parents and grandparents made it through. They need to know that they come from strong stuff so that when they face adversity I want them to think I can get through this because here's what my grandparents went through. I have to back up for one second though to the phrase dangerous play in case anyone doesn't know what that means. Yeah sure. What that means is don't run to stop them from climbing on a boulder because they might scrape a knee. What that means is teach them how to use sharp knives and let them do it. What that means is let them walk home from the bus. I'm not I'm talking about anything terribly dangerous. I don't say to have them play in traffic but they need to be competent in the world. If you never give them a sharp knife to handle. If you never teach them how to cook. If you never teach them how to do for themselves they're going to feel like they're acting. I mean I call it a veal calf life. They're terrified of the world outside the cage so they never want to leave the cage. Social media isn't only tough for kids to navigate in terms of challenges. It can be tough for parents too. Difficult moments perhaps taken out of context can be recorded and go viral. What effect is that kind of public scrutiny maybe having on parenting as well? You know I love that question because of all the things that kids were we that we all evolved to handle. We didn't evolve to handle the dangers of social media. No none of us is is has adapted to being humiliated by a million people. Okay. So I think it's easy. That's a case of subtraction and we've known it and parents have known this for years what they haven't gotten is support. We have known for the last eight years at least in Jonathan height and Gene Twangy first raised the alarm sounded the alarm about this that social media is not good for kids. We need to get it out of the schools. We need to get it out of their lives. And I think you know that's that's almost a no brainer. It's so important. Is there any chance that gentle parenting or at least some of it is a facade that's happening you know and maybe parents are a little bit harder at home than they are in public in terms of being more authoritative at home. I don't think so because parents when they report say I try I mean that you read any of these or you interview you talk to gentle parents but also you interview them. They often tell you I tried really hard never to say no but I think here's where I think you're right. I think because it's such a disaster and doesn't work then you have parents who lose their tempers with the kids. And that's the worst case of all sending a child calmly to his room because he has just hit his little sister. Okay. Is not cruel but when you get to the point where you have lost your mind because the child's getting more and more violent and aggressive and disobedient well that's not a good place from which to make a decision about you know what what the kids you know punishment or consequence should be. What happens when you do get to that point if you get to that kind of worst case scenario it is that a more appropriate time to seek some outside intervention. I trust people who have raised good kids to adulthood. Not the so-called experts we never know you know very rarely do these parenting experts show you the people that they have raised with all their wonderful skills and tactics. But ask adults they're all around us who have raised good adults to people to adulthood load bearing walls in our society. People you can depend upon to show up for work not claim they need a mental health day off. People who are solid spouses and parents you know anyone who has raised a good adult I'd ask them for advice but but these parenting experts I'd really keep away. Is there a one size fits all type of model for parenting experts you know guidelines that that various experts do agree on along with people who've raised good kids you know sort of a common denominator here and what determines whether a parenting trend you know sticks or not. So what determines in the if a parenting trend sticks it seems to be social media but what actually is good for kids authority is really good for them independence focus on things outside of themselves feeling part of something greater feeling part of community of people who love you and love you back all that stuff is wonderful for kids it's not a series of hacks and tricks and it doesn't put the kids feelings center always and that's the key it's not that you never consider of child's feelings of course or you never consider that a child might actually need an intervention a psychological intervention or even a medication it's that it shouldn't be our default our default must be with kids you're going to be just fine because if they hear that they're much more likely to realize it's true and they're much more likely to develop the internal resources to make it true. Abigail Shryer independent journalist and author of bad therapy why the kids aren't growing up thank you very much for your time oh it's a pleasure thank you and now some good news with Tanya J powers staff members at the Richmond Wildlife Center in Virginia are going above and beyond to feed in care for an orphaned baby red fox that found her way into their care they want to make sure the kit can be reintroduced into the wild someday and doesn't become imprinted upon humans so they're doing their best to act like mother foxes in a video posted to the center's Facebook page executive director Melissa Stanley is shown wearing a red fox mask and rubber gloves while feeding the kit from a syringe the kit sits on top of a large stuffed animal fox that's supposed to look like her mother the post explains that they're also minimizing human sounds creating visual barriers and taking other precautions the kit was less than 24 hours old when she was brought to the center and late February after a man walking his dog found her in an alley in Richmond he thought she was a kitten while life center staff looked for the kids mother but when they found the den site the other foxes had been trapped and removed so the staff have been taking turns feeding the kit every two to four hours all while wearing the fox mask the fox kit will eventually be transferred to the animal education and rescue organization in northern Virginia which has three other kits of similar age and weight they plan to eventually release them all into the wild together taunia jay powers fox news what's on your mind marches women's history month and women are at risk of becoming just that history the most radical voices are pushing to erase women and many of these bullies hold enormous power to force us all to conform i know this firsthand as a student at the university of Cincinnati my gender studies class professor gave me a failing grade on a project proposal for using the term biological woman who knew that stating the truth is unacceptable in today's institutions of higher learning places that once dedicated themselves to discovering the truth our education system is not to suppress the truth it is intentionally and actively attacking it this isn't speculation in an interview with the Cincinnati enquire professor Melanie rose nipper admitted that she had been using her position of authority to four students to conform to her progressive views for years miss using one's power is a textbook definition of a bully professional should be teaching the truth not defining it nipper called my words exclusionary and contributing to heteronormativity that might be true and we can debate it as we showed on a college campus but not while banning a truth men and women are biologically different this assault on truth is bigger and stronger than individual professors using their classrooms as bully poprits young people are hostage to the college degree system that makes or breaks the course of our lives earnings potential opportunities and types of jobs were captive to it and forced to participate and pay for these degrees which is why the progressive left installed diversity

I'm Kennedy. Tuesday March 5th, 2024. I'm Dave Anthony. I should have said super Tuesday. There are contests in 15 states and former president Trump could defeat Nikki Haley and all of them taking a big leap toward the Republican nomination. Just looking at the map and how the math works out. Some of these are proportional. Some of them are winter take all and if he does very well, he could be in position to mathematically clear and show the 12th. I'm Jessica Rosenthal. Super Tuesday, maybe Nikki Haley's last stand as the Trump team feels a tailwind from yesterday's Supreme Court decision. Joe Biden does not have a base. Nikki Haley doesn't have a base either. So she should focus on winning voters within her own party before she even talks about a general election. And I'm Janice Dean. It's super Tuesday with voting in 15 states. Plus there's a Democratic caucus and American Samoa. But with President Biden facing very little challenge on that side, the focus is on Republicans. We need each and every one of you to get the patriots from your family, your friends, everybody get them out and turn them out to vote in record numbers. That was for President Trump at a rally in North Carolina. He also told supporters in Virginia on Saturday not to worry about all his indictments. He calls election interference. I don't know what's going to happen. I really don't know which all going to work out. We're going to come out so good. I'm more popular than I ever was because of these people. In addition to those two states, there are also primaries or caucuses in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Vermont, and in Colorado and Maine, where the former President will be on the ballots after Monday's Supreme Court ruling rightly or wrongly chaos follows him. And we can't be a country and disarray in a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. We won't survive it. That was Nikki Haley in Portland, Maine Sunday. The same day she won the Washington DC primary, her first victory. The Trump campaign dismissed it saying that Washington inciders crowned Haley queen of the swamp. But she may have a tougher time today when more than a third of all the Republican delegates are up for grabs. 11 of the 15 states in the US have opened primaries to independence and Democrats could vote. And so that would be potentially something for Nikki Haley to tap into. But so far she's only won the DC Washington DC primary and the prospects of a big win, some place. It's tough to see, but you know, it depends on who comes out. Now as far as her campaign, she has vowed to stay in this race. She hasn't said much though about beyond super Tuesday, correct? Right. And there's some reporting and we're trying to dig it out about whether there are ads or appearances post super Tuesday. And so far, it seems like there is not a big road map of what's happening after super Tuesday. So I think, you know, that'll be something to watch tonight or her speech whenever it happens throughout the evening. Yeah, we watched in South Carolina. I watched your coverage that night. Former president, Trump went first. He did not in New Hampshire. And he was angry about what she said in New Hampshire, but he went first in South Carolina like minutes after the voting was over there. Do you expect him first, her first? Do you know? Do you have any idea? I don't know. I think he does like the going first thing. I wouldn't be surprised if he gave a speech early. I think everybody's going to be waiting for her speech to see exactly where this is going. I mean, a lot of the messaging she gave in the last speech in South Carolina, obviously, her home state, which she lost significantly was more about keeping going and that America needs a choice and 70% of the people pulled don't want Biden or Trump. I mean, it sounded like a no labels third party kind of run, but there's no indication that she's doing that either. Well, then she shot that down. She said, I'm not going to I'm a Republican. I'm not an independent. She seemed to say that's not going to happen. So if she's right and she sticks by that, would she potentially be like the others like Tim Scott Doug Bergen, who dropped out of the race that finally would endorse the former president? She's been very strong. Speaking out against him, raising the debt and limiting, you know, doing a lot of things in office. Chaos always follows him. Yeah. She's definitely sharpened Dorel Bose in recent weeks. And I don't know that an endorsement would be forthcoming. She may, you know, want to spot on the stage and at the convention, you never know what's happening. I don't think she's in the position for a VP pick, at least from Trump world's perspective. And so what happens next, I think, is anybody's wonky. But you've you're a student of history, Brett. You know, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush ran a tough race in 1980. Didn't look like they were going to be a ticket and they ended up being a ticket. Right. And that is something that does happen. And she would have the second amount of delegates heading into the convention. So she could make a case. But I don't think Donald Trump is thinking in the way Ronald Reagan is. And everything he says is that VP doesn't matter. Until it does, you know, in case, you know, if he was in a position where he needed something, he could be transactional in that way and decide that he needs that to win. But there's not a sense that he does at this point. At least he's had a couple of good weeks of storylines and polls and hardpress to see how he thinks he'd have to be backed into a corner to take Nathie Haley. Of course, on Monday, the Supreme Court rules that he is going to be on the Colorado ballot. He's going to be on the main ballot in Illinois. It also had a decision to remove the Trump name over the 14th amendment, disqualifying him for leading an insurrection with a Capitol riot, but the justice is through cold water on that whole movement. That was unanimous decision. Is that what you thought would happen? I think after listening to the oral arguments that that was in the cards, either 8, 1 or 9, 0. The fact that it was 9, 0 is significant. You know, this is across the board, the wrong thing for a state to do. And it's only Congress, the ruling says, that could operate on section 3 of the 14th amendment. I expect all of that to be kind of expunged. The main, the Illinois, Colorado, all of that will be out of the game. There is another big Supreme Court ruling that will affect the former president's future and that is the community ruling that dealing with the January 6th case. Remember, we need a float chart based on all of these different cases. And you've got January 6th, you've got the documents case, let alone the cases in Manhattan. Yeah, New York, Georgia, too, which is still up in the air as well, but the Manhattan, the New York City one starts in a couple of weeks. And that's the first one. That's the one that will, that they expect no delay there. Move forward. And if there's a conviction, we're an uncharted territory, correct? We are. We are an uncharted territory, but there's nothing in the Constitution that says convicted felon can't run. There's nothing, you know, politically, you wonder how that affects independence and suburban women, but the former president has done a pretty good job of characterizing this as the witch hunt as he talks about it. And because all of the cases lined up the way they did, it was easy to paint that picture for even independence who overwhelmingly think he may have done something wrong, but that this has a political edge to it. Of course, son, and I like this with so many votes, so many states, you'll be looking for trends, what kinds of things will you watch for? Well, I think some of the polls that we will take ahead and during, it's not really an exit poll, it's kind of a rolling poll, we have a survey. We'll tell us a lot about what people are thinking. If it matches what we see about concern about the president's age, about his ability, I think that that's where really the vulnerability and the weaknesses for President Biden as well as the issue of immigration. We've seen immigration be the top issue in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, and I bet we're going to continue to see that across the board. Yeah, and of course, there are Democratic primaries on Super Tuesday. Biden is expected to win. In Michigan, there were 13% of Democrats there that went uncommitted and a protest vote against the president's support for Israel and the war in Gaza. I know there's a call for some to do that again on Tuesday. Do you think that'll be a story as big as it was? I don't think as big. Michigan has a pretty interesting contingent, obviously in there and led by Congresswoman Rashida Taleeb. It's a little bit concentrated in a place like Michigan and Minnesota, but in many of these Super Tuesdays, it's not as concentrated. I think you'll have some uncommitted vote, but it won't be as big a story as Michigan. Are we going to hear from the president? What if he might win all the contests? Will he speak? I doubt he'll speak. I think he'll leave his speaking to the State of the Union on Thursday. I wouldn't be surprised to hear some changes in immigration executive orders. I wouldn't be surprised to hear a State of the Union that is left about the shopping lists and more about the threat to democracy and kind of laying the groundwork for what he sees the second term being if he was to be elected. Now, as the speech writers, they're going to be aware that people would be watching him. It'll be after nine o'clock, Eastern time. Is he going to be sharp? Is he going to be, I mean, does he have to address his age in the State of the Union or not? I think it pretty soon. He's going to have to make a pretty direct addressing of that since it is overwhelmingly popping up in every poll. I'm not sure the State of the Union is the place to do it, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are some references to that. I think that his campaign speech is probably going to have to address that. And, you know, politically, part of the vulnerability for President Biden is that vice president Harris's approval numbers are lower than his. And that's a real weakness when you look at someone who maybe people think is too old, who would be next. And that's part of the problem with that ticket. The big story coming out of Super Tuesday, maybe all a lot of victories for former president Trump. He, if he does as well as people think how close is he to securing the number of delegates he would need for the nomination? Well, 1215 is what's needed. And it is possible if he runs the gamut that on the 12th, he could clinch if not the 12th and then definitely the 19th. Just looking at the map and how the math works out. Some of these are proportional. Some of them are winter take all. And if he does very well, he could be in position to mathematically clinch on the 12th. Brett, great to talk to you. Thanks so much. All right, you bet. I'm Dana Perino. Join me for my brand new podcast Perino on politics. It's Super Tuesday and former president Trump leads former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley in polling, but he's also already won several state contests, the latest being Missouri and Idaho, though Haley did not try first win in the district of Columbia. Most of the states holding contests today either hold open primaries like Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia, and independent or unaffiliated voters get to pick which party ballot they want in Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, and North Carolina. And those voters are who former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley is appealing to. We have some internal numbers that we're looking for and that's what we're going to focus on. I'm not going to share those today, but our goal is just to be competitive. But what will she do after Super Tuesday if Trump wins most delegates? 70% of Americans don't want Donald Trump or Joe Biden. 60% of Americans say they don't want that they think Donald Trump and Joe Biden are too old. I'm a conservative Republican. I always have been, I always will be. I'm not going to do a third party. That's not anything I'm interested in. But these voices cannot be ignored. Former President Trump said Monday, I want to win based on my policies are better. We're going to cut taxes. We're going to get interest rates down. You're going to be able to buy homes again. I mean, you can't buy home today. The interest rates are so high. I want to win on safe borders. I want to stop wars. He blamed his many legal cases on President Biden. Fight your fight yourself. Don't use prosecutors and judges to go after your opponent to try and damage your opponent so you can win an election. The Biden campaign issued a statement after Trump spoke titled statement on Trump's unhinged drabbelings at his country club. Trump did speak from Mar-a-Lago after legal victory. The Supreme Court unanimously agreed that states cannot keep Trump off the Colorado ballot. The state Supreme Court had found he'd engaged in an insurrection and should be barred from the ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. But the U.S. Supreme Court found the Constitution makes Congress rather than the states responsible for enforcing that against federal office holders and candidates. This was a huge win for President Trump and for our campaign. Caroline Levit is the Trump campaign's 2024 National Press Secretary. But most importantly for our great country, the Supreme Court was unified in their 9-to-nothing decision that partisan judges from one single state cannot determine who millions of Americans in the rest of the states get to vote for. And so while they were, while the Supreme Court justices were unified in their decision on this ballot election interference case, President Trump will remain focused on unifying the American people to make this country great again to secure our southern border to rebuild our economy and our military to end the wars that have began under Joe Biden's leadership. And as President Trump exemplified in his press conference yesterday after the ruling, you know, he said that Joe Biden needs to stop using political law fair to win this electoral battle. Let's win it on the issues that matter to American people. That is the border in our economy and these wars overseas. Caroline, there are a lot of delegates up for grabs today. But there will still be some work to do after Super Tuesday, right? You need 1,215 to clinch the nomination. There are a little over 870 delegates, I believe, up for grabs today. So he's he'll be well on his way. But most of these states are not, I don't think any of the states are winner take all, right? So there will still be unless you get over 50 percent, I think in California or in some states. But so what is the, I guess the plan just to keep on keeping on after Super Tuesday and continue doing what he's been doing or is there a shift? Well, Super Tuesday is going to be a delegate avalanche for President Trump. We are expecting that this will be a pivotal day that brings him very close to achieving the necessary delegates to be the official nominee based on our polling, our most conservative estimate of receiving the necessary delegates required is March 12th. And so we are just about a week away from the president officially becoming the Republican party's nominee. And we're very excited about that. We're going to continue doing exactly what we have been, which is focusing on the general election in Joe Biden, painting a very clear contrast between life and Joe Biden's America and life in President Trump's America. And when voters think about whether they were better off four years ago under Joe Biden under Donald Trump or today under Joe Biden, there's a very clear answer under President Trump. Our border was secure. He was the first president in the modern era not to get us into new wars. Unemployment interest rates mortgage rates were all a record low under his leadership. And we've seen all of that change drastically in the last three and a half years under Joe Biden. And that's why Joe Biden is the weakest president in American history based on recent polling that shows that he is trailing President Trump. So we feel as though we have the momentum coming out of Super Tuesday. And we're well on our way to President Trump being named the official party nominee. And we're going to keep fighting around the clock to paint that contrast to the American voter. Okay. So Nikki Haley is still standing. She says she's the alternative. And she and you know this. She says Trump will be wraps up in court this year. And that's partly why she's still in this. What is the campaign's response to that because it sounds like she's saying, look, we don't know what will happen with Donald Trump. But I'll be here with the second most delegates. And she it sounds like she thinks that will count for something. Well, that's wishful thinking on Nikki Haley's behalf. That must be the Democrat donors who are contributing to her campaign whispering sweet nothings into her ear that are never going to come to fruition. President Trump has the truth on his side. And we're seeing the truth slowly but surely being revealed in all of these Biden led witch hunts against the former president. The president has the best legal team in the business. They are working around the clock to fight each and every one of these cases. We are winning as proven once again by the Supreme Court's major nine to nothing victory against the election interference cases, which are now dead because of the Supreme Court's ruling. And we'll continue to tackle these cases one day at a time while the president simultaneously makes his pitch to voters and is out on the campaign trail far more than Joe Biden. President Trump gives speeches every week in states across this country in front of thousands and thousands of people while Joe Biden can hardly read off of the teleprompter. So he'll continue to work hard and outreach to as many voters as he possibly can. And the Democrats want him in a court room, but that's not going to stop him. Getting 50% to Biden's 42%. It's like an eight point lead. And with independence, she's ahead of Biden by 15 points. But Biden is ahead of Trump by eight points with independence. What is the former president going to do to make the case independence as he moves through the year? Well, there's several polls far more that actually show President Trump beating Joe Biden with independence. There's many polls that show President Trump winning over his spanic voters, which no Republican candidate at this stage in the race has ever done. There's also significant polling that shows President Trump winning a historic margin of African-American voters more so than any other Republican candidate ever. And that's an earth shattering number in itself for the Democrat party and for Joe Biden's electoral chances. Joe Biden does not have a base. Nikki Haley doesn't have a base either. So she should focus on winning voters within her own party before she even talks about a general election. But Joe Biden's base has completely abandoned him. 70% of Democrats wish that they had another option. 60% of Democrats don't think Joe Biden has the mental or physical stamina to be president for another four years. While President Trump's base of Republicans has never been more fired up or enthusiastic about his candidacy and ready to vote for him. We've seen that proven in his massive electoral victory throughout this primary everywhere from Iowa to Nevada to Nikki Haley's home state of South Carolina. You can't win without your base. You can't win without enthusiasm. President Trump has enthusiasm. Joe Biden does not. And when it comes to independence, our message is very clear. Again, are you better off today than you were four years ago? Any rational logical American, which most independence are, will think to themselves and think, no, absolutely not. And we're very confident that will be a winning message on November the 5th. Former President Trump has said that President Biden, as you already noted, would do better if he stopped these prosecutions against him. That the prosecutions only seem to strengthen Trump. But there is some polling that indicates a big chunk of people, including Republicans, would not vote for someone who's convicted of a felony. Is that on the minds of the campaign? No, what's on our mind is fighting these legal witch hunts that are led by the Biden White House and the Biden campaign. What's on our mind is making sure President Trump can be out on the campaign trail as much as possible, speaking directly to voters. Because that's where he wins voters over. Something Joe Biden himself cannot do. And so again, we will continue to have our legal team fight all of these cases, expose the truth about them. And we will continue to ensure President Trump is making his message and pitch to voters very clear. Okay, finally, there is a world of time, as you know, between now and November. But a lot can happen, right? And the economy is the big issue other than the border. I know that's very low, but it's actually better than it has been in two years. So it's climbing. It's going up, even though it's still obviously very low. If the economy slowly but surely gets better or people even just perceive it is, how does the campaign navigate that? I mean, that will be good for Biden. The president is not. Former president is not going to want to root for, you know, bad economy. So how do you how do you all, you know, navigate that? voters won't forget what has happened to them over the past three and a half years. The highest inflation in a generation has rocked American households across this country, robbing them of $20,000 every single year, $20,000 more just to have the same quality of life that they had a few years ago. 70% of Americans say that they are getting behind, they're falling behind. They're not getting ahead. And so sure, if inflation comes down, gas prices come down, that doesn't mean that people are still not suffering from the catastrophic impact that the record high inflation that we've had and the record high gas places has had on their pocketbooks and their households, buying a home and importing a family is the American dream. And just in three short years under Joe Biden, that dream has become completely unattainable for so many. And you compare that to the booming economy that we had, especially pre pandemic, where unemployment was a record low, jobs were returning back home from overseas because small businesses and even large companies in this country felt as though they were able, they had the bandwidth to hire people because they were making more money. And so the confidence in our economy under president Trump was highest ever under Joe Biden. It's lowest ever. And there's no way that Joe Biden will be able to make up ground on this very important issue. Caroline Levin, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you so much for having me. It's been 20 years, but detectives in Florida believe they have found the remains of autumn Lane McClure, a 16 year old girl who vanished in 2004. In May of that year, Autumn's grandmother reported her missing, telling police, her then-boy friend dropped her off at the mall and then they never heard from her again. A few months later, the Sheriff's Office received evidence that she was staying with 31 year old Brian Donnelly and his girlfriend Jessica Freeman. They worked with Autumn at Windixie. At the time, they claimed a teenager stayed with them for a few days and then left. In 2021, police received a tip that Freeman and Donnelly were involved in Autumn's disappearance. After Donnelly died in May of 2022, Freeman called police, asked for immunity and revealed that teen was in a sexual relationship with the much older couple and that she saw Donnelly strangle Autumn. Last year Freeman told detectives, Autumn was buried in the Orman Beach area of Florida. And that's where the remains were found. Police say it'll be difficult to determine a cause of death. When it comes to what happened in New York back in the spring of 2020, if we were to have another pandemic tomorrow, how would our current leaders handle it? Without a thorough investigation into the decisions that were made during the height of the COVID-19 epidemic, I fear we will once again be putting lives and livelihoods in jeopardy. This was a catastrophic event that has never been given a thorough post-mortem to evaluate and dissect decisions made by the highest levels of government. Looking back at the worst disasters our country has been through like 9-11 or Hurricane Katrina, there were studies after action reviews, hearings and investigations to reflect on and learn from. I'm holding out hope that the Pandemic Response Study Commission, Act A, 8053 and S, 8168, being considered by legislators in New York State, will begin the process of trying to provide answers and accountability. Because for many of our families, this is deeply personal. We lost my husband's parents in late March and early April in 2020, after a reckless order was issued to admit thousands of COVID-positive patients into adult care facilities. Over the last few years since their deaths, I have taken part in countless rallies, hearings and advocated for the passage of legislation, but until now nothing has ever been done. We the people of New York have every right to know how and why these decisions were made and who signed off on them. The one thing that was known very early on in the pandemic is that our elderly were the most susceptible to contracting the virus. Some of our questions include finding out the origins of the March 25th order that flooded nursing homes with COVID patients, were doctors and or scientists involved in these decisions, and why weren't the makeshift hospitals consisting of those setup at the New York City's Jacob Javits Center and the USS Comfort ever used. Access to this information will only come if there is subpoena power. Without it, we won't have the data, communication and testimony to help us better understand how these life or death decisions were made. To this day, we still don't have an exact count of how many seniors we lost or a comprehensive after-action review developed by the state agencies on the COVID-19 response. The pandemic is much bigger than the flaws of any one single official, but the overall system was broken to begin with and needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. COVID killed more than 80,000 New Yorkers with over 15,000 of those being our seniors. With exception to the controllers audit and a report in January 2021 from Attorney General Latisha James, confirming nursing homes were ill-equipped and ill-prepared to deal with the pandemic. We have not seen anything to show that our government is making the proper adjustments or establishing protocols to ensure that this won't happen again. A category five disaster which took the lives of tens of thousands of New Yorkers should be a priority for everyone who cares about the safety of our state and its citizens in the future. These issues need to transcend partisan politics. It's up to us to remind our leaders that if we don't learn from the past and the mistakes that were made, then our loved ones will have died in vain. That is why I'm urging lawmakers and all of New Yorkers to join together and support the passing of Pandemic Response Study Commission Act, A8053 and S8168. There have been proposals and well-intentioned hearings in the past, but I pray that this one makes it past the finish line. Because every day that goes by without answers means we get further away from finally uncovering the truth.\",\" I'm Jerry Willis. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Shannon Bream. Monday, March 18th, 2024. I'm my command. Well, House lawmakers are expected to hear from former Hunter Biden business associates this week. But after saying he would testify publicly, President Biden's son now says he does not plan to participate. Leading Republicans say their investigation has uncovered plenty. We've found millions of dollars that the Biden's have taken in from bad people in bad countries. We speak to House Riverside Committee Chairman James Comer. I'm Prisphaster. Starcoa's athletes are paid now for the use of their name and a genlikeness. And chaos has caused, as some people saying I told you so. Do you want a environment where somebody goes to the highest bitter? I know it's the American way to the grid. And I'm Carol Roth. Many are convinced action must be taken to get a handle on the crisis at our southern border. But President Biden says it's Congress's problem. Mr. President, when is an important executive action coming? An executive action on the border? Coming on the border action happened by itself, the posse. The Congress can come to an agreement. Well, they haven't yet. They haven't yet. It's a pretty fun on how to help them. President Biden's son Hunter was supposed to headline a high profile congressional hearing this week. But Hunter Biden has had second thoughts about appearing on Capitol Hill. Florida Republican Congressman Byron Donald says Hunter should answer questions about Biden family business dealings. We can clearly see that Hunter Biden was the backman that he did take money from CFC that he did text the chairman, chairman Zau sit next to his father back in December, Hunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill to speak with reporters, but didn't want to go inside to speak to House lawmakers. Republicans do not want an open process where Americans can see their tactics. Expose their baseless inquiry. Or here would I have to say. What are they afraid of? I'm here. I'm ready. The border problem and its impact on border states and many major American cities is likely to be a red hot campaign issue in this year's election. Part of the Biden argument is the country cannot go back to former president Trump being in power. Folks, it's not hyperbole, you see, guess our freedoms are literally on the ballot this November. Donald Trump and the migrant Republicans are trying to take our freedoms away. And by the way, not all Republicans that say his ain't your father's Republican party. These guys are different. Former president Trump and battleground Ohio raised some eyebrows with this comment. I don't get elected. It's going to be a blood bath for the whole. That's going to be the least of it. It's going to be a blood bath for the country. That'll be the least of it. Trump campaign a say Mr. Trump was talking about the economic impact on the auto industry. The stakes are high at the top of the ticket, but also in the house where Republicans are hoping to hold on to their tiny majority. Some suggest Trump on the ballot will help the GOP. When he's on the ticket, the turnout is significantly higher. It's not even close. Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, James Comer. So we always have a dip in turnout when he's not on election, when he's not on the ballot. I think him being on the ballot is a huge positive for us. And I think the Republicans will retain the majority. Mr. Chairman, you're set to lead another hearing this week investigating what you call inconsistencies and testimony in the Hunter Biden investigation. What can we expect from the hearing and who will we hear from? Well, we hope to hear from Hunter Biden. I mean, he said for months he wanted a public hearing. The media attacked me for wanting to do a deposition. And accused me of not wanting to have Hunter Biden testify in public that how he said, after the deposition, we'd have the public hearing. So this is the week for the public hearing. We're going to have three of his former business partners with him. The reason we're going to have those four panelists is because what the three business partners said, Hunter dead and Joe dead is vastly different than what Hunter testified under Oden is deposition about his knowledge and his father's role in their business scheme. So we thought that we would just have a public hearing, let the American people see for themselves and see if they can make a decision on who's telling the truth. Tony Babalinsky has criticized Hunter for not testifying before Congress how pivotal will Bob Balinsky's testimony be to this investigation? Pretty significant. I mean, if you look at all of the people that Hunter Biden was in business with, Tony Babalinsky is the one guy who is never in trouble. He's the one guy who's credible. He's the one guy that's never been indicted or incarcerated that Hunter Biden was in business with. I mean, the media and the Democrats are trying to attack me for some of the people that we've been deposing. They say, oh, they're criminals. Well, it's not a reflection on me. That's a reflection on the Biden. That's who the Biden's wearing business with. Bob Balinsky is the one guy that's clean. And I'm looking forward to hearing from him, because what he says, Hunter and Joe did is vastly different than what Hunter testified under oath. So there's a huge discrepancy. And we just felt like it would be best for the American people to hear with their own ears and see with their own eyes. Hunter Biden's high profile DC attorney, Abby Lowell has called this investigation a carnival side show. What would you say to that in the critics of the investigation? Well, Mr. Lowell has represented Senator Manendez. He's represented Hunter Biden. And he's representing very good. So he's very good and credible at representing people that many in Congress have accused of influence peddling. But at the end of the day, I think this has been a very transparent, very substantive and very credible investigation. Now, he may not like that. The outcome, because he's representing Biden and Manendez are both pretty guilty of a lot of serious crimes, federal crimes. So I just disagree with Abby Lowell. He gets paid a lot of money to get people that break the law out of trouble. And he's got his own opinion. I just disagree with it. If Hunter Biden's a no-show, do you think the public will be able to get a full sense of what went on with Biden-ank business dealings? I think so. I think so. And there would probably be other opportunities. I'll just say this. I fully expect Hunter Biden to testify in a public hearing. He's got enough time to come to this public hearing with his business partners. So I'll leave it at that. If I were Hunter Biden, I would show up for this public hearing that he demanded. And the media, the terrible media, the corrupt mainstream media that has attacked me throughout this investigation for having the audacity to investigate the Biden's and their public corruption, accused me of being afraid to have Hunter Biden in a public hearing. Well, here it is. And the media is completely tibeted. They've completely done a 180. I think, oh, well, he's already testified. He's already testified. No, no, no. He hasn't testified publicly yet. And that's what they wanted. So we'll see what happens. There's two occasions where Hunter was supposed to be in front of our committee. And he didn't come, but he had public signs outside. So I, he, you know, it's not like Hunter Biden has a job or anything. When he's sitting there living off of that Kevin Morris in a $40,000 month apartment, I don't know if he's still got his Kazistaki Porsche that he got when Joe Biden was a vice president, but he'll, Hunter has the means to show up on our date of the hearing. So hopefully he'll be there on a related topic reports suggest that the House Republicans are now looking at passing influence peddling legislation. Give a sense of what that would look like. And do you think it could gain bipartisan support? Absolutely. And if you go back to November 14th of 2022, the midterm elections had just happened. We flipped the house, but I didn't become chairman until January. So at this point in November, the Democrats are still in the majority, but I'm the chairman elect, so to speak. I had a press conference, a 33 minute press conference. I announced the investigation with Jim Jordan, Nancy Mays, Byron Donald, there were a few of my oversight colleagues standing beside me. And I said the object, the objective of this investigation is to get the American people to cruise about what the Biden has done with our adversaries around the world and to pass influence peddling legislation that would prevent this from happening in the future. And since that press conference, we've found millions of dollars that the Biden has taken in from bad people in bad countries. And most of it happened while Joe Biden was vice president. And no one knew that. And the narrative was always two things. So none of the money happened while Joe Biden was vice president. And Hunter Biden is like Jared Kushner. He has a real business. No, Jared Kushner has legitimate assets through this whole investigation. I'm a finance guy. I've never found a legitimate business that Hunter Biden had. This is one of the most serious, if not the most serious crime that any presidential family has ever committed. And I think that despite the awful, partisan weaponized media, I think that we've been successful in getting the truth to American people. And now we're to the point to where it's time for accountability. And that's why I can't emphasize enough the importance of Hunter Biden and his lawyer showing up for that public hearing. Congressman Ken Buck is retiring from the house this week. I don't need to tell you the house majority is slim and shrinking with his departure or how much more difficult does that make the job for House Republicans? Well, my message to Ken Buck is don't let the door hit you in the butt on the way out because he's been that's about an obstacle. So really, he was a pretty consistent vote for the Democrats. It really doesn't affect it any. He was gonna vote no on anything. Although he did vote for the impeachment inquiry and I appreciate that, I told him that. But Buck's disgruntled, unfortunately, I don't think it's anything. We have a lot of disgruntled members in our conflict. There's a lot of animosity over those eight Republicans and Buck was one of them that joined with the Democrats to get rid of McCarthy, which totally disrupted the conference because you had to get new staff. You brought in a speaker, and that's got a good guy, came in with Mike Johnson, but you know, never been in leadership before. And you know, we had to, everybody had to update him on what their committees were doing and it just really set us back. And it caused a lot of hard feelings. And so Buck's been nothing but an Instagram or his whole Congress. I mean, I think, I don't think we'd lose much there, but we have to be unified. And the only unifying vote we've had on any major bill that I can remember in a long time is the vote to go to the impeachment inquiry phase. So despite the media saying that Republican Conference doesn't support this investigation, there's overwhelming support. Everybody in our conference supports the investigation of the Biden-Inflink pedaling and they realize there's some very serious crimes that have been committed by this family. The crisis at the border showing no signs of lighting up. The Biden administration is not taking executive action on the issue. Are you hopeful Congress could take action before the election? I don't see what Congress can do. The president has the authority to secure the border. He has a military. He has the Border Patrol agents. And he says he needs more Border Patrol agents. That's below me. We've been to the border. He hasn't. We've been to the border numerous times for Republican and Conference. The Border Patrol agents say that Biden has changed their job from securing the border to changing dapper and doing paperwork instead of securing the border, the Border Patrol under Joe Biden has become the welcoming agency. And Joe Biden wants all these illegal things. That's the Biden policy. That's the Biden border policy is an open border policy. They want to fundamentally change America. And I think the American people see that. I think that Joe Biden has demonstrated that he wants an open border. We have an immigration crisis because of Joe Biden. He doesn't need a bill to secure the border. That's his job. That's Mayorkas's job to protect the American people. He's the chairman of the House Oversight Committee.

The men's college basketball tournament starts tomorrow since the Supreme Court ruling in 2021, those athletes have the opportunity to make money licensing the use of their name, image and likeness, for example, and ads and video games. The video game company EA Sports says more than 10,000 players have accepted an offer to appear in an upcoming college football game, getting a minimum of 600 bucks in a copy of the game. So a lot more money to be made than that, though, and star athletes are out there looking for it. I want the quality of life or student athletes to be the best it can be. And I think they should have a seat at the table. And I think they should share in some of the revenue. But I think it needs to be, you know, equal across the board so that a school that kind of forward more can't create an advantage for themselves, just because they have more money to spend. What's happening now has been compared to the Wild West. There's no question. It's chaos. Fundamentally, why do they have it? Well, for the longest time, you see 110,000 people at the University of Michigan. And you're saying all those people paid 50, 70, 200, $500, $1,000 for good seats. And the only people not benefiting are the players. And the only people indispensable, you could argue are the players. So something had to change. I get it. I understand it. Stipens, that's it. And Chris, I think you know, with the demands of Division I player, Division I athlete. I don't care if you're swimming lacrosse, non-revenue volleyball, soccer, football, especially, you really don't have your time. You don't have your summer. So you really can't get that side job. You can't get it. You're not doing, you're not a time for a work study job. So they said, OK, what about name and engine likeness? It wasn't a short time ago. Johnny Menzel got suspended. Yeah. Because he went to a autograph show where he signed his name and his picture. So they said, this get ridiculous. Well, I mean, it's a question of fairness. I mean, it's not the school's paying you, but if you want to do a commercial, who's to stop you from doing a commercial? Here's the question. So I go to do a commercial at the University of Texas. I go to Texas and the coach says to me, guys, I thought you want to meet our very successful alumni, some of which have some card dealerships and they own some TV stations. Then you can be a contributor here. I think you can appear in a dealership. So all of a sudden, the University of Texas, it's not because of the majors they offer or the size of their campus. But they're going there because they're getting more money. Do you want a environment where somebody goes to the highest bidder? I know it's the American way to a degree, but should there be some regulation? We can only make so much money. There can only be so much interaction where we know you register. Chris, so you have to go and register your company with a major body that says, this is how much you're gonna give. This is the regulation and this is what you're gonna do. And when you go to sign the quarterback at Georgia, we're gonna write you down. Okay, here's the quarterback. How many are you gonna do? Right, fine. But then the courts just rocked it and said, no, this nothing. And now it's down to the Wild West again. And we saw Nick Sabin, the most successful coach in college football history, say to his wife or his wife said to him, you don't like this anymore. He said at the end of the season in which they lost in the finals, I believe, or semi-finals, he said kids were lined up not to find out what they were gonna do next year. Say coach, if you don't give me more money, I'm transferring. Yeah. I mean, it's almost like it is. It's free agency essentially because now it's become easier for kids to transfer, no sitting out of year. Right, right. Which used to be the rule. How much money do the biggest stars making? How much can I... That's a great question. It's virtually undisclosed. And I'll give you an example, Arch Manning, who is at Texas. I don't think he's taken a snap yet. And he says he wouldn't collect it, but he's got like $5 million in I.L. money. I don't know if they have the ranking, but are you talking about millions of dollars? Now what's good about it? Kind of get to see these guys and these women for four years. So that's remember how we got to know Patrick Ewing and Akima Laiju on on these guys. Because kids stay in school longer because they're going to make money instead of just jumping right to the pros. Right. And kind of good. So now if I'm CBS, and I get to roll out a bunch of players, I kind of know, I remember Bobby Hurley fight four years at Duke. He plays one year, Zion plays one year at Duke. I don't even remember he went to college. So it helps sell that and sell everything. So that I kind of like, kind of wait. So you'll have to people be 21, 22 before they go pro. And just keep in mind, the conversation we're having, most people will not do this for a living. This is their moment. And I think a lot of people can't get their head around. Why can't they just wait to make money? The money's not waiting. They're going into the real world. And if they didn't get a chance to study and get that degree, I don't know what you're gonna go in with. This kind of reminds me of marijuana laws where guys who used to spend time in prison or get kicked out of college or get kicked out of their college program for doing something that's now completely legal. Very similar. Yeah. It's interesting. I call in the government, believe it or not, to Joe Manchin's talked about this, believe it or not, college teammates with Nick Sabin. And they've been working hard on this. If everyone is the same objective, get the kids some money, though this is their moment, but I just think you got an offensive lineman here you go. You know, you're at Alabama fine, but if you're at East Stroudsburg State, Division two, right? You get 4,000 people at your game. So everyone's like, well, where are we giving them? I don't know. I can't write a check to them. I don't need the answer, but they're writing a check, but that's something to think about. Maybe there's fundamental, if I'm a Division one athlete, I am getting $25,000 a year volleyball player, Nebraska. You do sell up in arena at Hofstra. You're not selling in arena. So maybe there is a Division one, Division two, Division three. Well, there's a pool of money and the kids get it. But just to show you how complicated it is, but fixable is Nick Sabin said, you know the money at Alabama? We're basically paying basketball and football, pays for all the other sports. Sure. So just so you know, if I have to pay my players, we're gonna lose sports. And isn't the goal to have us be a student athlete? As I wonder if it's gonna hurt smaller sports, if you're just saying overall booster at the University of Texas, and you're throwing, here's money for the athletic program. Now I'm not gonna give you money for the athletic program, I'm gonna give you money for that kid. Should you? Yeah. I mean, that's it. I want to spying to Orange Manning. I love the family. I love the commercials. This guy's gonna be gold. I love to know that he would show up with my banner in the backdrop. All right, he's not starting. You know, so is that right? You're picking a player. Now as a coach, you're gonna feel pressure to play that. You absolutely have coach of the impression to play. Recruiting was already a big part of the job. And now you've got to recruit high school kids. You're gonna recruit the transfer portal because that's so easy now. And then you're gonna recruit your own kids to stay. Great point. And Chris Rick Patino said that is St. John's. So people don't know, 70 years old to be coaching for 45 years already in the Hall of Fame. He said that some of his best teams at Kentucky and Louisville, my best players didn't play for two years. So they just trained. Now I will lose that kid. Coach, I'm not sitting again. I got somebody else. You know, Eastern Kentucky wants to give me more money and I'll get off the bench. So now as a coach, I might have to sacrifice a game to put that raw rookie with a lot of talent to make him feel more part of it. So he doesn't transfer. So what, like people listening to us right now go, so what, let the coaches adjust? I don't know. I don't know if I want a 17 year old holding up a program, changing substitution patterns. I want a coach putting the best team out there to be most successful out there. So everything's in flux. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think the only people with the power since the NCAA lost in courts to come in and set this up is the government. Yeah, I mean, people think of crazy stuff. You've got to be torn. I'm sure you're like your fundamentally a free market guy. But I don't know what the guardrails are going to be. Well, I didn't grow up in a college football environment. Where'd you grow up? Not a college football. It's Northeastern, it's the same as you. So not a college football. But BC, Rutgers. But if I go south, they don't even know that they're probably, I mean, they don't have pro teams. So they don't care about the Panthers, nearly as much as Northern South Carolina teams. So, so how many people would go watch Auburn, Alabama if they knew those kids weren't in class? If they knew those kids were mercenaries, just out there playing, they don't care about the Crimson Tide. The reason why they're out there is because they got paid more. And all I could tell you is, the only thing indispensable is the majesty of the league you're playing in. Semipro football gets no one. You watch the USFL, XFL are coming together. They're going to begin to build a legacy, but that does not pay the bills. The thing that pays the bills is looking at Alabama and seeing the black and white leather helmet person from 1930 and seeing how far we've come in 2024 and saying I'm part of that legacy. Instead of I'm a mercenary that came there one year because Nick Savin found a way to get me more money. I don't know. I think you might be blowing up what you love so much. What does this also, I wonder, look, there's always been big schools, medium schools, small schools. I wonder if this makes the big schools bigger, the medium school smaller, and the small schools, of course, just a small. Yeah, I think it was happening with the consolidates here in the conferences and the collapse of the pack 12 now. So when these use USC and UCLA go, yeah, I don't really, California. I really want to stay here. I'm going to go play against the bigger teams, more revenue. But wait a second, coach. I got to go 1700 miles to go travel. I got class on Thursday. I got to go travel there and get there on Saturday. Oh, yeah, forget about class. If you forget about regions now, I want to go to the conference. It's going to get me the most revenue to give me the best shot at a national championship. So the one double A, it's always tough drawing, historically black college. Oh, and let's see on Sanders' coach, he's going to be a new, tough going. But I do think it's going to hurt those second level good schools. And I guess you'd put, you know, Tulane in that category. And again, where does the volleyball player from Eastern Connecticut state come into this? Who isn't making revenue for the school? I guess, oh, well, you're not making revenue for the school. That maybe that's where the free market comes in. Right. We're certain sports and certain divisions and certain conferences get more. You got to go tap into your alumni in order to supply the athletic program in order to get some sponsorship. I remember I played Division II soccer, and we almost had no revenue. The new coach came in after I graduated and said, yeah, forget about no new revenue. I'm going to go sell sponsorships. So we literally went and sold sponsorship and tied him to the fence and the program boomed. So I ask you, even though it might be a smaller school, East Kentucky, East Stroudsburg State, Nova University, over in Florida, there are people that will support it. But you're going to have to go sell it, and you have to be prepared to give the players money. But I like your idea that you brought me into is give categories. One, if you're in those power conferences, here's your offensive lineman. Here's your defensive lineman money. Here's your running back money. And then maybe give them a certain section to go. You got a great personality, great smile. You're the sugar ray Leonard of your class. Right, everybody wants interview. Give them that category. But I just think everything's got to be disclosed. No more under the table. Don't tell me what actually I had. Everything's disclosed. And I do think there's got to be limitations set it up and revisit whatever you come up with. Put it in in two years. Revisit in in five years. Keep the same panel in place. Like Tommy Tuberville is doing all this sports stuff because he's a foreign football coach, who's in government now. But there's a lot of people that would love, like there's a lot of people that would love to play a role in this. They just love this sport, to play by play people. The athletic directors, they're retired especially. No worse in the race. The active people are consultants. The experts from sports casting to former players, to management, athletic department, managers, to former sports executives of Gatorade, of Nike, of Reebok, Under Armor, also playing a role. And just say, how do we figure this out? Everyone should put their hand in and no one should feel as though they've been locked out. With fundamentally giving players what they need to be able to play and go to school. Yeah, I mean, now that the box is open, let's see what this is in five years. If there's no regulation, I hate to see what's going to be left of it. It is going to be... Or see what the regulation is in five years. Right. I just hope that Joe Manchin, before he leaves, he's leading this at a couple of conversations with him. He's passionate about it. And now they just leave and he's really gotten a horse in this race. I know West Virginia, college football, college basketball means a lot there. I don't know how you remember your family's names. Right. I see the pictures of them. All right. Brank Hillmead, thanks, man. Thanks, Chris. Here's a look at the week ahead. Monday, a pair of first amendment arguments are heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, including a lawsuit by the state of Missouri, alleging the federal government colluded with big tech companies to suppress free speech. Tuesday gets your brackets ready. March Madness begins. 68 Division I men's college basketball teams play an essential role in the game. The first two teams are in the game. The first two teams are in the game. 68 Division I men's college basketball teams play in a single elimination tournament leading to the championship game in April. Wednesday, the federal reserve will wrap up a two-day meeting and announce their decision on interest rates. In remarks to Congress, Fed chair Jerome Powell's at the Central Bank would not lower interest rates until inflation goes down. Friday, Congress needs to pass a second set of spending bills in order to prevent a looming partial government shutdown. This final group of funding would go toward the Department of Defense, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security among others. And that's a look at your week ahead. Far too often, women's lives are cut short as they fall victim to unthinkable crimes. But each week this month, I'll be joined by women who fought back, survived, and took back control. You won't want to miss this month's stories of survival, strength, and resilience. Carol wrong. What's on your mind? During his entire tenure, Biden and his mouth pieces have tried to blame just about everything for inflation, except the actual culprits, which include his fiscal policy, alongside damaging fed monetary policy. We were told there would be no inflation, that it would be transitory, that it was good for you and only hurts the rich, that it was consumers fault, that it was businesses fault, that it was Putin's fault, and it was backward looking, among other nonsense, trying to justify the erosion of the middle and working classes purchasing power. Biden has returned to trying to single out corporations as the cause of inflation. When Sesame Street's beloved cookie monster tweeted his own exasperation with inflation and the form of shrinkflation, leading to smaller cookies, yes, even fictional characters are being impacted by it. Biden's team blamed corporate America and greed for this outcome. Biden's talking at a bull's sides of his mouth. When he claims the economy is doing better and the GDP is growing, well, wouldn't that mean the corporations are growing as well? And when he highlights that wages are increasing, that obviously creates higher costs for businesses, that they then pass on to consumers. It's all related and he can't claim economic victory and then chastise the businesses for their growth. Moreover, corporate profits aren't increasing at a material higher rate than during other times. When prices increase, that drives sales growth. Keeping margins constant, more nominal earnings will be had by corporations. Again, downstream outcomes of inflation. According to facts set, Q3 2023 marked the seven the consecutive quarter that the S&P 500 reported lower profit margins. At the same time, Y charts shows lower US corporate profits after tax as a percent of GDP than when Biden took office. And Guru Focus using Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows a shrinking corporate profit margin during the time period inflation was raging under Biden. The idea that corporations just decided to become greedy is always a stupid talking point. If someone is charging too much, another company would come in and sell at a lower price at the same quality to take market share if they could. Also, why would they just become greedy now? Particularly in the last couple of years, as the purchasing power of consumers has dwindled you to inflation. It's as Biden likes to say, malarkey. But that's not stopping Biden's authoritarian ways. Instead of taking ownership of the masses created, he is using his gas lighting as an excuse to move us further away from free markets. Biden announced a task force by both the FDC and the DOJ on corporate pricing. Notably absent is any focus on government spending in pricing, by the way. The focus of this endeavor is not only to crack down on illegal pricing, but quote, unfair pricing, whatever that is. As we know, the concept of unfair is completely subjective. In terms of government, unfair is a weasel word to allow them to further pick winners and losers and do more stupid things that would ultimately hurt the economy, like institute price controls, which always leads to bad outcomes like goods rationing. Customers aren't stupid and gas lighting them adds insult to injury. We all know what caused inflation and who's to blame, whether we are on Main Street or Sesame Street.

They call it Super Tuesday for a reason. This is a big one. Plus, investors await Fed-chair Jerome Powell's comments on the state of the U.S. economy as he heads to Capitol Hill. And why Ukraine is taking its fight against Russia all the way to Sudan. It's Wednesday, March 6. This comes just hours after Super Tuesday handed hundreds of delegates to Haley's rival, former president Donald Trump, who won all of the night's GOP contests except for Vermont. Ben Tellus, what do we know at this hour? So later this morning we expect Nikki Haley will suspend her presidential campaign. She'll do it in remarks in her home state of South Carolina. People familiar with her plans tell us. And most importantly, I think she won't immediately endorse Donald Trump for the nomination. She's going to say that she wants Donald Trump to try to win the support of her supporters. And then I think down the line she'll make a decision about whether she actually wants to go ahead and back in. Ben, you have covered primary fights before. Is this setting up some sort of potential reconciliation? Maybe something that could happen at the Republican convention this summer? It's a good question. You know, back in 2016, Ted Cruz famously didn't endorse Trump. And at the convention kind of dramatically said, oh, you should vote your conscience. It was a big, a big split that you don't see almost always people who lose and these primaries end up endorsing the nominee. And it's pretty notable that Haley's holding back on that. And I think it's a good indication of just how raw this race got at the end. Yeah, was that her motivation Ben for getting out of the race to avoid widening any fissures within the party? Or was this, I don't know, out of necessity, a lack of resources? Do we have a sense? There wasn't any path for her to keep going forward. You know, her team was really watching the Super Tuesday results to see if there were any glimmers of hope places where she overperformed a path forward. And she only won one state and she came pretty short everywhere else. And she had some money. But there was just no sign that it was going to get any better for her next week or the week after. Trump was going to lock up the nomination, whatever she did. I think it made sense for her at this point to just decide to bow out. Ben, you mentioned earlier this race getting kind of raw near the end. And Haley's speeches did get increasingly heated in recent weeks where any bridges burned here in the final stretch of the primary for her early on in the race. You saw her try to take a balanced approach and maybe not alienate Trump supporters because she knows that's a big chunk of the party. And later on in the race, she really got emboldened to say, look, this guy can't win. I can be Biden and he can't his legal problems are a huge burden on the party. And we all have to be sort of honest about it upfront. And she kind of relished the role of being like a truth teller in the party. Ben, thank you so much. Thanks for having me. Let's turn back now to the super Tuesday results and Donald Trump's near sweep in 15 different contests last night. Molly ball is the journal's senior political correspondent. She's been stand up tonight looking at results coming in from all over the country. Molly, the main storyline here has got to be Trump's success pretty much across the board now in a position to look past this primary fight. Trump's victory speech was quite significant because we really did hear him pivot toward the general election start to make that general election argument really lay the groundwork for the campaign that lies ahead against Joe Biden. We heard him focus on the issues focus on the economy focus primarily on immigration. We know those are the issues that are on top of voters minds and issues on which voters broadly trust Donald Trump more than they trust Joe Biden. We heard him talk about unity both in terms of unifying the Republican party, although he did not mention Nikki Haley or really even allude to their being any competition within the party. And then also talking about unifying the country as he claimed was the case when he was president. The polls would suggest otherwise his tenure as president was quite divisive, but he's talking about something that a lot of voters are yearning for in terms of bringing the country together. And we can expect to hear him make that argument as he campaigns against Joe Biden. So with this speech and with Joe Biden state of the union speech on Thursday, it's really this week represents the moment when I think both candidates are pivoting toward the general election and starting to make that case to the electorate as they look toward November. Turning to the other side of the aisle here, one thing we've been looking at coming out of Michigan's democratic primary last month was whether president Biden's vote share was suffering at all. If there are any signs we could spot of internal frustration among Democrats around his handling in particular of the Israel Gaza war did that show up at all last night. It showed up a little bit. You know, not every state offers this uncommitted option in the ones that did it was a pretty small share of the vote with the exception of Minnesota where it looks like Biden may have lost as much as 20% of the vote to that uncommitted option. That is a state somewhat similar to Michigan, obviously geographically and demographically. And Michigan, there was a quite organized campaign on the part of Arab American voters to get people to vote uncommitted as a protest vote against Biden specifically in protest of his Israel policies. That may have reared its head as well in Minnesota, but we don't see broadly across the board that Biden is facing significant dissent from within his party rather ironically given that we see in polls that many Democrats wish he weren't the nominee. We still do not see a large chunk of his party either gravitating toward another option such as the Minnesota Congressman Jean Phillips or coming out to make that protest vote against him. And Molly, let's quickly type a few other loose ends from the night, both the House and Senate back in DC are hanging in the balance and there were a number of races around the country that those watching Congress closely had their eye on last night. Take us through any of the highlights that jumped out to you. Well, the big game here is the California Senate primary where we've been watching to see whether the front runner Democrat Adam Schiff, who is a congressman from Southern California, whether his competition in the general election would be a fellow Democrat or Republican. California has a so called jungle primary where the top two vocators, regardless of party advanced to the general election. And there were a couple of other well known House Democrats competing with Schiff, but a late surge by a Republican candidate, Steve Garvey, a former star baseball player for the LA Dodgers. He made a late surge into contention thanks in part to a lot of help from Adam Schiff's campaign. And that was a successful gambit shift will now face the Republicans, Steve Garvey in November that I think will lead Democrats to breathe a sigh of relief because it means that in such a solidly blue status California. Schiff is the overwhelming favorite against a Republican and likely won't have to spend a lot of money freeing up those donors to spend on other races. The one concern, I think, for Democrats is that may mean that there are less coattails for shift down ballot. California also has a number of competitive house races. Most of those are still out as of early Wednesday morning. We don't know exactly how they're going to shake out in terms of the candidates emerging from the primary. Molly, thanks. Thank you.

It's just that easy. In other news moving the world today, Australia could be heading toward recession as its economy continues to slow. Market reporter Anna Hurtinstein said the country's 0.2% growth number for the fourth quarter adds to concerns that a hard landing is coming, especially if the reserve bank of Australia delivers on its plans to hike interest rates. The Australian Central Bank's treasure told reporters that the risks to the Australian economy are actually shifting from inflation to growth. So this is a rising concern. According to an economist where it's actually seeing some signals of this already on a per capita basis economic activity has slowed over the past year, the most in 33 years. He is in stark contrast to the strong US economy, which Fed chair Jerome Powell will be giving his take on later when he begins two days of congressional testimony. So what people are looking for is signals on timing. One could we potentially see interest rates start to come down for this particular testimony. Economists are broadly expecting him to deliver the same message that we've heard from a lot of officials recently. And that is that there's no rush to cut rates at this time. The situation is still at an elevated level. And we're hearing that they're looking for more proof, more data that's showing that it's coming down on our system all the way. Powell's statement is due at 10 a.m. Eastern. We are exclusively reporting that the front lines of the war between Ukraine and Russia now extend to Africa. According to several Ukrainian soldiers involved in the operation, Ukrainian commandos have been sent to Sudan to support the country's military ruler in a bloody civil war. And General Ukraine reporter Ian Levit told me about Kyiv's rationale for doing so. So Ukraine had several reasons for sending troops into Sudan. First of all, they've had a relationship with the Sudanese military since shortly after the Russian invasion in 2022. And so for a time, they were getting a significant number of weapons from Sudan, which is one of the most heavily armed countries in Africa. That was before Sudan's own civil war broke out. But more importantly, the Wagner paramilitary group has been mining gold in Sudan and in neighboring countries and using that to fund the war in Ukraine. So for Ukraine, this was an opportunity to really cut off the supply of gold to Moscow that's been helping fund the war in Ukraine. And to make it more costly for Russia both economically and militarily to pursue these kinds of interests. Though Ian, this is a strategy that's not without risks. The US has said that both sides, including the one that Ukraine is supporting, have committed war crimes in Sudan. And they've pretty explicitly warned other countries against getting involved. Egypt has been sending weapons to the Sudanese military and the United Arab Emirates has been sending weapons to the rebels. But as far as I'm aware, Ukraine is the first foreign country to actually send troops into the conflict. This obviously potentially risks alienating allies. In an interview, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency declined to comment on whether he deployed troops to Sudan. A spokesman for Ukraine's president didn't respond to requests for comment, nor did Russia's defense ministry. Meanwhile, Venezuela has announced that it will hold an election in July with current president Nicholas Maduro likely to seek a third, six-year term. Opposition candidates, however, some of whom are in exile are banned from running or prohibited from holding office, with analysts saying that Maduro wouldn't call an election without the certainty of winning. This comes as the US in October agreed to lift sanctions against Venezuela's oil industry in exchange for democratic concessions that the Maduro regime has since backpedaled on. Those sanctions are up for reconsideration in April. And in a seismic move in the college sports world, Dartmouth's men's basketball team has voted in favor of forming a union. The National Labor Relations Board says 13 of the team's 15 players voted to join the service employees' international union yesterday. After an NLRB official concluded the players are employees, given Dartmouth's ability to control the work they perform and because the players perform that work for compensation. Dartmouth immediately filed a request for that decision to be reviewed with the spokesman saying that, quote, Classifying these students as employees simply because they play basketball is as unprecedented as it is inaccurate. But as journal sports reporter Lane Higgins told us the debate about whether college athletes are playing or working for their schools is far from over. There is another NLRB case that is currently ongoing in California against USC, the PAC-12 conference and the NSTAA that could potentially be broader than this case at Dartmouth. Because right now the Dartmouth ruling, if it is upheld all the way to the Supreme Court, would only affect a handful of private universities and the athletic programs they have. And the vast majority of universities in DB-1, especially at the top level, are public. But the case out in California could potentially apply to every university in the country. While the NCAA has long insisted that college athletes are unpaid amateur students, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in 2021 that strict NCAA rules. And that strict NCAA limits on compensation in the form of education-related benefits, violated antitrust laws. And that is what's news for Wednesday morning. Today's show was produced by Kate Bullivant and Hadi Moyer. We will be back tonight with a news show. And until then, thanks for listening. It's Biden vs Trump again after Nikki Haley exits the race for the White House. Even though we've had a long period of people not liking their presidential candidates, our polling shows that the intensity of dislike is stronger, the antipathy toward either man is higher than we've seen. And Troubled New York Community Bank Corp gets an investment of more than $1 million. Plus Fed Chair Powell says the central banks on track to cut rates this year. It's Wednesday, March 6th. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. We reported it exclusively this morning and now it's confirmed. Nikki Haley, the first major candidate to challenge Donald Trump for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, has suspended her campaign. Haley lost all but two of this year's nominating contests. The former South Carolina governor was Trump's first ambassador to the United Nations. But in announcing her exit from the presidential race today, she declined to immediately endorse her former boss. It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that. At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people. After Super Tuesday, the path was further cleared for Trump to become the Republican standard bearer for the third consecutive presidential election. On his social media platform today, just before Haley made her announcement, Trump boasted that he'd quote, Trump's turn on Super Tuesday. Meanwhile, Trump picked up an endorsement from outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, despite years of acrimony. McConnell's decision to back Trump comes after weeks of negotiations aimed at repairing the rift between the two. McConnell blamed Trump for the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, though he did not vote to convict Trump in his impeachment trial later that year. And then there were two. After Super Tuesday, the country is moving into a new phase of the 2024 presidential election and an expected matchup between President Biden and former President Donald Trump. It may be a rematch, but it's an election unlike any other. President Biden is the oldest presidential candidate ever, and Trump is only slightly younger. Both are essentially running as incumbents on already established White House track records, and they're pitching to a very polarized electorate. Great to have you back, Aaron. Hey, good to be with you. Let's start there, Aaron. What the candidates have in common. It may seem to voters that not much, but they do share some similarities on age, on an existing record voters can look to. What else? Well, that's right. These are two. Well, Biden is the oldest president we've ever had. Trump isn't that far behind him. He's age 77. Biden is 81. And these people are universally known. We're going to go through the next months of this election, and for a lot of people, they're not going to learn a whole lot about these two men that they didn't know before. They're also very strongly disliked. And even though we've had a long period of people not liking their presidential candidates, our polling shows that the intensity of dislike is stronger. The antipathy toward either man is higher than we've seen. So given all of that, how are they going to be pitching their messages to an unenthused, and I imagine in some cases, we re-electar it. Well, that's right. I expect to see from Joe Biden a lot of negative advertising. He's got to make this a choice rather than a referendum on himself, because his job approval numbers are pretty weak. And I would highly expect his campaign to focus on raising the negatives of Donald Trump on at least three things. One is abortion, fortified by this IVF opinion that came out of Alabama. Two, I think you'll see them use the Trump tax cuts to argue that they went disproportionately to the wealthy and to corporations. And three, of course, is the fragility of democracy in our democratic institutions and what happened on January 6, 2021 after the election. Trump, of course, has been running against Biden for a long time and demonizes him. He's a very unusual candidate in that he has such an intense amount of loyalty among his supporters and continually fortifies that loyalty. What's been interesting to me with Trump lately is at this point in a campaign you would expect the candidate to move to the center and try to enlarge your group of supporters. He until very recently has still been out there demonizing Nikki Haley supporters, saying that their donors are not welcome in the Republican Party, saying we're running the Mitt Romney's out of this party. You know, Aaron, it also strikes me that a lot of what we're used to seeing during elections, the debates, the conventions are changing a lot too. That's right, the kind of rhythms that we've become accustomed to, really have changed. As you mentioned, we just had a series of debates that never heard from the leading candidate. We just had a series of primaries and caucuses which most people suspected were over before they ever started. Now we move into a general election in which, you know, can an 81 year old candidate barnstorm the country? How much can they put him on the campaign trail? We don't know if there are going to be debates. There's an argument for Joe Biden to participate, to try to put to rest, any questions about his mental acuity. But if they occur, I suspect that Americans are going to be watching them less for what policies each man would bring to the White House, because these are people who already have track records in the White House. Then for whether they're going to show that they have the mental acuity and physical robustness to handle the job. We talked a little bit earlier about the debate over abortion and access to reproductive rights. What else has shifted for voters over the past four years? Well, one of the main ones is inflation and immigration, particularly immigration. Our polling finds a rarity in politics, which is that an issue other than the economy is now top of mind for voters. And that is immigration. We still have this overhang of inflation. But as the economy and inflation kind of wane as issues, immigration has come to the fore. And it's just more prominent and more problematic than we've seen. And you're seeing large shares of independence and even Democrats say that immigration is a problem. And overall Americans are not satisfied with how Joe Biden is handling it. And finally, Aaron, we talk a lot about this being an unprecedented election. And there's really not a better word I can think of for it. One of the candidates, Trump, of course, is facing criminal trials. What are the next couple of months hold? Well, that's right. We've never had this kind of split screen election where events in the courtroom are playing out at the same time as events on the campaign trail. And Americans are going to have to sort through what they think about this and what it might mean that even once elected their new president of its Trump could be hampered by civil cases where he's had serious adverse judgments against him. That could cripple his family business and criminal cases that could still be ongoing while he's in office. We've just never seen that before. Coming up, Fed Chair Jerome Powell says the feds on track for rate cuts this year. So when will we see them more details after the break? Hey, what's news fans? Listen up. That's right. But that's not all. So we know they definitely have something for you. And it's already included in your prime membership. That's Amazon dot com slash what's news? It's just that easy. New York Community Bank Corp is getting an investment of more than $1 billion from a group of investors including former US Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin. The group led by Mnuchin's Liberty Strategic Capital also includes Hudson Bay Capital, Reference Capital Partners and some of the bank's management. The banks said the investors have agreed to buy common and convertible preferred stock. And YCB also announced an overhaul of its management. As we've been reporting, the bank has been in crisis since it showed signs of trouble in its commercial real estate books in January. Swung to a fourth quarter loss and slash its dividend. Last week, it disclosed that it had found material weaknesses in the way it assesses and monitors loans, triggering several credit downgrades. The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved a new climate disclosure rule that requires public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions. But the amended rule stopped short of requiring them to report certain indirect emissions like those from their supply chains and customers use of their products. Environmental groups argue leaving them out misses the biggest chunk of greenhouse gases. Adoption of the new rule caps a contentious two-year process of intense lobbying from some of the world's biggest industries and influential climate groups. Corporations and Republicans had fought against it, arguing the SEC was reaching beyond its authority. Companies will need to start reporting emissions for fiscal year 2026. Some smaller companies won't be required to disclose them. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the Central Bank is on track to cut rates this year, in remarks today before the House Financial Services Committee. Powell said January inflation and hiring data haven't changed the expectation of rate cuts, but that the Fed wants to see more evidence that inflation is slowing sustainably. I'm joined now by our Chief Economics correspondent, Nick Timoros. Nick, what exactly does that mean, a sustainable slowdown? What is the Fed looking for? Well, what Powell said today is they basically have had six very good months of inflation and they just want to make sure it's more than six. So he said a little bit more data. The markets are pricing in a June rate cut and he said nothing today to really rule that out. So it looks like we're heading towards a June rate cut. Maybe they will push it back if the economy continues to surprise with stronger growth data and firmer inflation. But he really didn't seem to react to the fact that inflation in January had been higher than expected. So on track for June, the big question has been basically when these cuts are going to happen. Yeah, I mean, he didn't say June and he didn't say May. They have pretty much ruled out doing it at their next meeting, which is in two weeks. You know, they'll have more data by the time of their early May meeting. They'll have even more data by the time of their June meeting. And if it looks like it has, you know, late last year, economy doing fine, but inflation coming in cool, that could keep the door open really for a June cut. You know, the risks for the Fed haven't really changed over the past few months. If they stay at a very high interest rate as inflation comes down, it's possible that their policy stance will be tighter than the economy needs and you'd have a bigger slowdown, then you really need to get inflation down. The other risk is that they ease too much or too soon and you have inflation progress, stall or reverse. Any other insights from Powell today on the state of the economy? Well, the big surprise today was that he pretty much, you know, threw the white flag up on this bank regulation proposal that has met with a lot of pushback from the industry. He suggested there would be broad and material changes to it. That's something the industry has been pushing for. And so it means that it'll probably delay when these rules take effect. And finally, sports gambling has exploded in recent years. The US Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on the practice in 2018 and since then most states have legalized it. Wagers are especially popular among men and younger Americans. In a civic science survey, 47% of millennials and 58% of Gen Zers admit to betting on sports games. Now some young betters are taking their chances on gambling to help pay back their student loans. Our finance reporting fellow, Kaelin Rowan, looked into it. With the resumption of student loan payments and still low in debt rising to more than 1.7 trillion over the past decade, more young men and more young people are turning to sports money. My source, Kael Daniels, who was a 29 year old hospital patient transporter, who was able to pay off his $7,000 dollar student loan debt. But even he says he's very lucky and has recommend people to do this, and they're not disciplined. While there's no data on how many people are doing this to pay off student loan debt, since sports gambling became legal in the sale of Ohio, the problem gambling network of Ohio knows more young people are calling his hotline a side 55% increase in that first year. Of course, consumer advocates warn against gambling to pay your monthly bills. And that's what's news for this Wednesday afternoon. Today's show was produced by Pierre Biennium and Anthony Bansy, with supervising producer Michael Kusmedi's. We'll be back with a new show tomorrow morning.\",\" Super Tuesday sees 16 states holding primaries for both parties presidential nominees. It's often a contest that seals the deal, especially for the person challenging the incumbent. This year, both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are well out ahead as their parties preferred candidates. So, we decided to fast forward for this weekend podcast. And look past Super Tuesday to what we know so far about the voters who will decide the general election. In America's complicated electoral college math, certain demographics and issues will play an outsized role on November 5th. Join me and members of our U.S. elections team as we dig in to some of them. I'm your host, Christopher Walgespur, in Chicago. This episode is brought to you by Paramount Plus, an unlikely friendship begins in the Paramount Plus original movie Little Wing, starring Brooklyn Prince with Kelly Riley and Ryan Cox. Reeling from her parents' divorce, Caitlin steals a valuable bird to save her home, but instead forms a bond with the owner, leading to a new outlook on life. Rated PG-13 First up, let's welcome White House editor Heather Timbins. Heather runs the Reuters team that covers the Biden administration's inner workings on a daily basis. And she's also leading them on his campaign trail. Heather, thanks for joining me today. Thank you. I want to start out by talking about women. We've heard a lot about how women voters could make or break either candidate. Why is that? Because we all know we shouldn't talk about any voting block in America as a monolith. And the women's vote in America, while it does mean overall democratic, white women voted for Trump in 2020 by 55% to 43%. And so what we've seen a lot when we go and we talk to people that are supporting Nikki Haley, is there does tend to be a lot of women at her rallies. And there's a lot of women there who say, I voted for Trump. I held my nose. I voted for Trump. Thank goodness I don't have to do it again. Or I don't want to do it again. So a really big focus for both the Biden camp and the Trump camp is getting those Haley voters over to their side. And we're going to probably see for the next few months, both sides trying to convince them to come over to them. So what issues do the parties think they can use to do that? Right now, and particularly from the Biden campaign, they are looking at abortion rights and reproductive rights. And maybe more broadly, women's ability to have agency over their own bodies. It's one of the biggest advantages that Democrats think that they have. And they do have polling that shows that yes, democratic women believe that women should have a right to decide whether or not to have an abortion, but also independent women too. And that's something that anecdotally we see a lot is that voters that we talk to that consider themselves independence don't want the government telling them what to do about a lot of things, including again, what to do with their own body. So this is something that Democrats absolutely think they have an advantage. And how does that compare to the Republican strategy? Well, it's obvious that the Republican Party scrambled really quickly and Donald Trump scrambled really quickly to try to come out against that Alabama Supreme Court ruling. Trump said he supports the availability of IVF. We've seen Congress members proposing various different bills. I think we're seeing someone like Nikki Haley on the campaign trail talking about how she pragmatically would like to see the Republican Party address abortion and abortion limitations. Maybe she personally says I would be in favor of some sort of nationwide long to limit abortion at a certain number of weeks, but we can't win on this. So what we need to do instead is to figure out a way that we can win on it. We're going to see the state of the union next week. Democrats have picked a relatively young Congresswoman from Alabama to do the rebuttal on and she's a mother of young children. And I think they've specifically highlighted her to do that so that they can be talking to women. And women, they play an outsized role in the actual number of people who turn up to vote, right? It's interesting, you know, women register at a higher rate to vote in America than men do. And then those registered women come out and voted a higher rate. So there have been more female voters than male voters in every US presidential elections since 1964. What I think we saw recently come out from the ARP is that women age 50 and up play an outsized role in that voter rate. There's about 62 million of them and they cast about one third of all ballots in 2022, but they're just a quarter of the voting age population. One of the things that we've seen that have been very interesting when we talk to women voters, particularly about support for Joe Biden is there is an age gap right now. We talked to a lot of voters recently, young women who are very upset about his stance on Israel, about his failure to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Their students are out there protesting and these women tell us, but they're talking to their moms and their moms are like, if that man isn't elected, you're going to lose your reproductive rights. So there's this interesting sort of gender discussion happening among women on the left in America. Are there places where women will be more influential in November? The big swing states, you know, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Democrats are trying this time to win North Carolina. Georgia, Arizona, we already saw women coming out in those states in the midterms to vote pretty strongly for Democrats, particularly and in 2020, Michigan particularly had a huge rate of young voters. A lot of those young voters tend to be women. We're going to see Democrats looking to focus on women in some of the states that have big college towns. Michigan is a really good example for that. Wisconsin is another place that a lot of young voters came out in 2020 through various sort of social media and other organization kind of things. That's the kind of thing that we're seeing the campaign talk about. Now you mentioned young women voters. How are either party trying to extend that outreach to the younger voting population in general? Well, we just saw the Biden campaign join TikTok. Don't know how that's going to do, but you know, if you look around at social media right now, the young person's political conversation is happening online right now on TikTok. So there is nowhere else for them. Again, we're going to see them do a lot of college campus stuff. And that is definitely true for the Republicans too. We'll definitely see them try to do a lot of do a lot of college appearances. And beyond reproductive rights issues, what are some of the things that might motivate those Nikki Haley women voters that you mentioned to ultimately pick a new candidate? You know, that is a really good question. I mean, I think comfort about the economy. We see Republicans and Democrats both talk about crime. The latest polling that I have seen that looks at the issues that they care about is their reproductive rights and the economy. So we're talking about, can you afford your rent, your housing, your food and things like that? You know, super Tuesday is going to make this into most likely a Biden versus Trump race. And so what you're going to see everybody do after that is scrambled to go after these Haley voters and the people that are able to capture them might very well be the people that are able to capture this whole election. Are you in LA? Are you in San Francisco? Where? A lot of times you list. Omar Eunice is one of our video producers here at Reuters and has reported around the world for more than a decade. He's spending most of 2024 crossing the US to cover candidates and voters. Well, first of all, Omar, thank you for chatting with me today. No worries. Of course. Anytime. You recently traveled to Michigan for the primary and we saw a big protest vote by some Democrats about Biden's stance on Israel. What can you tell us about the voters you spoke to and how they could impact a general election? So when I was in Dearborn, which is more than 54% Arab, I spoke to Democratic Voters of all ages and different professions and almost all of them said that Biden's handling of the conflict in Gaza would possibly make them decide not to vote in November because they were so upset about it. One young Democratic voter that I spoke to Adam Abusala who's a 23 year old Palestinian American in 2020, he actually campaigned for Joe Biden. Muslims in Michigan voted for Biden, which put him over the top really. And when we look at it, we helped this guy get over the finish line and he was going house to house in his neighborhood. We donated him, we knocked on doors for him. But now he's actively campaigning against Joe Biden. He's definitely not committed to the Palestinians and their concerns. So we're going to vote uncommitted because we are not committed to this president and we're not going to be committed in him winning for another four years. We also spoke with the mayor of Dearborn Abdul-Lahamud, he's the first Arab-American mayor of the city. For us, it's this alignment with Benjamin Netanyahu and the most right-wing government Israeli history is truly a sense of betrayal to this community. He's a Democrat and I asked him if he was going to vote in November and he just kind of laughed it off. You know, I very much am operating on a day to day right now. Now, that's interesting. What compelled this community to vote Democrat in the last elections? Well, I think there's about 300,000 Arab-Americans or Muslims living in Michigan. In the last election, the majority of them overwhelmingly voted for Biden. That comes after former president Trump's Muslim ban, his fiery rhetoric. Trump was very pro-Israel also when he was president. He moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He upset a lot of Arab-Americans in the process. So Trump's rhetoric toward Arab-Americans while he was in office was incredibly problematic. And now President Biden's record in the Israel Gaza conflict is also a challenge. Where does that leave this community come this November? Well, it really, it really exposed depends on what Biden does in the lead up to November. He has said that he's hoping a ceasefire will be in place by Monday. And he has kind of upped his criticism of the Israeli military's response. And with Biden having one Michigan with only about 155,000 votes last time and there being 300,000 Arab-Americans, you know, it could really lead to some problems for him at Cominover and but things don't change. To give us a sense of what's going on in Michigan and beyond really, let's bring in Kat Stafford. She's our race and justice editor and is actually based in Detroit. Thanks for joining me today, Kat. Thank you so much for having me. So Kat, we just heard Omar talk to us about why voters in Michigan were disillusioned and chose to vote uncommitted in the Democratic primary. How did this uncommitted movement grow beyond just the Arab-American community there? So what we saw on the ground was really, and I think this is an important point, is that this was a multi-racial, multi-generational movement. It wasn't just Muslim and Arab-American voters who decided to come out and vote uncommitted. They were able to galvanize people across racial alliance to really send this message. And one thing that I heard in particular from a black advocate was that she said that she's hearing on the ground that black voters are also frustrated in seeing what has happened with Gaza. They also want to see a ceasefire happen. And in fact, she went as far as to say that if President Biden cannot understand the plight of Palestinian people, how will he ever understand the plight of black Americans? So I think people really wanted to come out and send a strong message to President Biden that they expect in our demanding to see more from him on this issue. What is it about the conflict in Gaza that is resonating with that community? I think people are seeing a commonality, a similarity they feel between the two sides. They see this as a version of oppression that they feel kind of as it was described to me a kindred spirit looking at the legacy of racism and how things have happened here in America, looking around the world when they see this happening elsewhere, what they perceive as being similar to what's happened to them, they feel a sense of kinship. And so they said, we can't just fight for the rights of black Americans and citizens here in this nation. This is a worldwide struggle that they view for civil rights and the rights of people. They're really trying to take that and use that as a way to unite people again across racial lines on this. Now in 2020, President Biden did very well in democratic led cities, right? Milwaukee, Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, and black voters were a big part of that coalition that he built. Do we see what happened in Michigan as a bell weather for some of the other states in future primaries? And potentially the one thing I do think that's also interesting to point out about the Michigan primaries that in the city of Detroit, the largest city in Michigan, which is about 77% African American. We did not see as significant amount of voters coming out to vote uncommitted. So some of the experts that I've talked to see that as a potential opening for President Biden and Democrats to get there, get on the ground and really try and raise awareness and get that support going again for this very, very key group of black voters in Michigan. Because I think the reality also when you're talking about black voters is there are a significant amount of issues that are resonating with them that are important to them. So while we are seeing a significant amount of support among some aspects of the black community and various cities on this topic, there are others that are really focused on other key issues impacting their communities on the ground. What are some of those topics? Well, if you think back to 2020, when we had the racial reckoning after the police killing of George Floyd, Brianna Taylor and so many other black Americans, people were really expecting and fighting for sweeping criminal justice reform. So we saw people demanding that Biden, the Democrats really take up these issues in a lot of other communities, they are really taking up the same kind of issues that are really important to them. And so there are a lot of other topics that are important to black voters. If you think about reproductive rights and health equity, that is something that is very important to black women in particular, which have been touted as being kind of the backbone of the Democratic Party as much as for black children, high blood pressure, black people have some of the highest rates of health and equity. So these are things that matter to them. Going beyond that, a lot of the people that I've talked to, they're also saying that we cannot forget about the threat of white supremacy, white nationalism and how that has manifested into real outcomes, such as the Jacksonville shooting that we had, the shooting in Buffalo, New York at the grocery store that killed several black Americans. So there are a range of topics that are resonating with black voters and they are not going to be that are resonating with black voters, including the economy and inflation. I just talked to a woman who mentioned that she was on the ground doing a focus group with black voters in this key swing state. And this woman said, listen, I cannot put food on the table for my children. That is what matters to me in this moment. So I think what we are seeing and what we're hearing from advocates is Biden has a lot of work to do in terms of galvanizing these key voter groups. How have Republicans found success in reaching out to black voters on some of the issues you just mentioned? So we are seeing Republicans trying to identify key places where they can try and show up a good number of black voters. I think the reality is is black voters have been the most consistent voter base for Democrats. So I think it's safe to say we're not going to see a significant amount of voters suddenly switch to the Republican Party, but what they're hoping for is can we get just enough to flip somebody's key states? So they're trying to get on the ground, get into somebody's communities and particularly make inroads. We're seeing some black men who are saying, hey, Biden isn't speaking to me, but I'm kind of interested in what the Republicans are saying. So let me hear them out. But others are saying it's kind of hard for us to separate the party from some of the inflammatory, racist rhetoric that they have seen. So I think we can't say yet for sure how that's going to turn out, but they are definitely on the ground in these communities trying to build up at least some semblance of a voter base. But I think they have to answer some tough questions in regards to how are you actually going to do something for black Americans when you have this history that a lot of people are quite uncomfortable with. Then I just want to say one other point on President Biden, while I think that there's a lot of frustration and anger in this moment for a lot of reasons, there are also a lot of people out there who are ready to get out the vote. They are organizing right now. A lot of voter advocates are getting the buses ready. They're talking to the churches, trying to figure out how to get out in the communities to galvanize voters in the same way that they did in 2020. So while there's a lot of skepticism, anger, frustration on the ground on the flip side, there are people who are excited and they really see this election as the determination of what America's democracy is going to be in the future. And reporter Ted Heson was on the southern border this week when both Biden and Trump faced off. They desperately need more resources, need more agents, more officers, more judges, more equipment in order to secure our border. These are the people that are coming into our country and they're coming from Jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institutions. The dueling visits reflect how immigration is playing a big role in voters concerns this year. And for a growing number of Latino voters, that issue is even more complicated, but it's not necessarily the only one that will decide their vote. Ted, you spoke with Latinos in Nevada. What are some of the things you're hearing? So Nevada is one of a handful of key battleground states in the coming presidential election. And President Biden beat President Trump there by a narrow margin in 2020. At the moment, former President Trump is leading in the polls and it's an area of concern for Biden. He's taken on this tougher immigration messaging and the idea is that nationally he wants to perform better with voters and show that he's addressing the issue, but there's also a risk associated with that too. And he could potentially alienate more progressive voters, Latinos who care about the immigration issue and would like to see policies that protect asylum seekers. That's one of the things that came out in conversations with one community organizer, Rico Alcombo, who's with an organization called Make the Road Nevada. This is not the way that we thought he was going to perform the immigration system. And they regularly go out and talk to people in immigrant communities, people in Latino communities, and have conversations about voting at times. And during some of his conversations, what he's hearing is that people were turned off. Latinos in Nevada in particular were turned off by the tougher stance that Biden was taking. He changed and changed and changed the way they yes we can. And now he's essentially chanting through his decisions, no, we can't know what's up with it. And I think there's a frustration element that comes with that, with the voters that we're speaking to. And also that President Biden hasn't done enough on the issue of immigration for them. So, typically what they'd like to see is more affirmative relief for people that lack immigration status, more protections and ways to be in the country legally and to work legally. So he's really got to thread the needle here, do enough to reassure both sides without losing either. It's a balancing act and it'll be a balancing act for Biden in the general election. And specifically in a state like Nevada, where there's a 3.2 million residents in Nevada and a third of them are Hispanic, one in five of them are foreign born. And in particular, there are several powerful unions that will turn out the vote for democratic candidates there. And one, for example, is the culinary union that has 60,000 members based in Las Vegas. And the majority of those members are foreign born. Immigration is a huge priority for that union. And they've said they would like to see more deportation relief for people that are here illegally, support for programs that allow people to get work permits if they've been in the country and they're following the rules. They're supportive of President Biden, but energizing their voters and getting people out may be more of a challenge if presidents out there with this tougher message saying that the border needs to be shut down. And Republicans are making inroads with Latino voters are, are Democrats concerned at all about that? I think what you see is that in recent election cycles in the last 10 years or so, Republicans have made progress with Latino voters across the US and in certain states that will be key to this election as well. One thing we noticed when we looked at Nevada, we looked at data from this liberal data and analysis firm called catalyst. And even though they saw that Republicans were making inroads with Latinos in Nevada, they saw that from 2020 to 2022, Latino support for Democratic candidates held steady at about 60%. And I think that from the Biden campaign perspective, maintaining that is almost a baseline at this point towards victory. And when you look at current polling and you see President Trump with an edge in those states, you could easily see why the campaign may want to energize Latino supporters there and turn out more. I think it's a tricky equation because Latinos are not a voting block. It's not a monolith. It's not that all Latino voters are going to come out and vote for one vision of immigration policy. So just like many voters, President Biden is trying to play two sides of the same coin and say that he can be tough on the border, but he can also be humane and not be as hard line as his opponent here, Donald Trump, when it comes to people who are in the country illegally now. Right. Right. And to your point, these voters, they might be more focused on the price of food or gas or maybe education, right? It's not just all about immigration policy. That's right. And I've seen polling on the Latino electorate that shown strong support for say a path to citizenship for people in the country, legally, but also significant support for stepping up controls at the border. So it's possible to hold both views to want to say that people who are here already should have a way to find work permits and stay legally. And then also we do need more control and we need a better way to manage the border. And I think President Biden is trying to find the sweet spot there. It is a tightrope act and he still has months to go before the election. Some of that could even be defined by what actually happens there. Crossing rose in December to the highest number for a single month on record and then fell by about 50% in January and have remained slow since then. I think if things remain on the quieter side, this issue is easier for Biden to manage. If levels rise back to record levels are beyond, it becomes much more challenging. Now the voters we talked about today are in no way intended to be an exhaustive list. There are other demographics, states and even counties that will be key to who becomes our next president.

Thursday March 7th, 2024. I'm Dave Anthony. President Biden goes prime time tonight, delivering a state of the Union address in an election year ahead of a likely Trump rematch. But it's not supposed to be a campaign speech. He's supposed to appear as a statesman. I mean, you've got all the pomp and circumstance of the presidency, all the power of the bully pulpit. You know, you don't have to grade that through pure politicization. And Lee Subradi, some progressive policies are falling by the wayside in liberal areas, but is it permanent or just politics? It's pretty amazing what an election season will do to politicians who have previously spent a lot of their political capital moving us in a direction that I think a lot of people would say has undermined policing and public safety. And I'm Jason Chafetz. Well, it's that time of year when Congress gathers for the state of the Union address, something that dates back to 1913 when President Woodrow Wilson started a new tradition delivering the speech in person. Until then, presidents only delivered a written report annually as mandated by the Constitution. Last year, President Biden said, under my plans, as long as I'm president, nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay in additional penny taxes. Nobody not one penny. Tonight, it's expected he'll focus on his efforts to lower prescription drug costs and protect Americans freedoms. In particular, abortion rights, a key issue for Democrats. And this year, it may feel even more like a campaign speech with former President Trump's last Republican challenger, Nikki Haley, dropping out of the race. It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that. So President Biden goes on prime time TV tonight with a Trump rematch near certainty. Well, the state of the union is always important because it is the most watched speech that the president gives. And he knows all about the state of the union. He was the lead speechwriter for two of president George W. Bush's addresses upwards of 20 million to 30 million people tune in and watch this speech every year. And it's a critical opportunity for Joe Biden in that he is the most unpopular president in the history of presidential polling and is going into an election in a few months behind Donald Trump with Americans deeply disapproving of his policies. And so he has to ask them for a reset and make a case for himself. Now that the Trump Biden rematch appears inevitable, Nikki Haley dropping out of the race the day before the state of the union. Does that affect this at all? I mean, the Biden campaign has been reaching out to Haley supporters suddenly after this drop out. I mean, does he mention her tonight? What does he do? His focus shouldn't be on Donald Trump. It shouldn't be on the Republicans. It should be on the trying to convince the American people to give him a chance for a second term. And the problem he faces is that what Biden tends to do is he tends to tell the American people that things are better than you seem to think they are. Does anyone think the state of the union is strong? Every president says that in their state of the union address, but I don't think, you know, 65% of Americans think the country is headed in the wrong direction. I think 43% plurality of Americans say Biden's policies have made their lives worse. And so if you say things to the American people that don't comport with their lived reality, they just tune you out and you look ridiculous. You said that this is the most watch speech. So maybe he could convince some of these people that they've just heard the wrong message about the economy, that if they just pay attention to his accomplishments on climate initiatives, hey, job growth has been terrific since he took over after the pandemic, that inflation has come down a lot since its spike in 2022. Do you think that that would work? No, because people know what's going on in their own family finances. Credit card debt just topped a trillion dollars for the first time in history. So if you're an American, you look at Joe Biden's inflation and you see that you went from having a savings account that was full of cash to maxing out your credit cards. And now he says, well, now inflation's better. It's like, I'm sorry, but I'm maxed out on my visa and my master card and my discover card in order to pay for the inflation of the last three years. I'm not giving you credit because finally it's slowed and the prices, by the way, haven't come down. They've just stopped growing as fast. You have to always take into account the lived reality of the people who are listening to what you're saying. If you talk about your foreign policy, it's a success. They see that their war is raging in the Middle East. They see there's a war raging in Europe. They see American ships being fired on with impunity by the by Iranian back rebels and you and and terrorist groups. They see Americans being killed in the Middle East and nothing being done about it. So you know, they see with their eyes what's going on in the world. You can't tell people don't believe your lie and eyes. Things really great. Things aren't great. No one thinks the state of the union is strong. On that note, there are always invited guests at the state of the union's speech. The president sometimes honors them by name and they get praised and cheered and by members of Congress. Well, lawmakers also have their own guests. So I want you to listen to Michael McCall, the Republican chair, the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Well, I'm taking the Christie Shambon who whose daughter, Nicole G was killed by a suicide bomber at Abigate in Afghanistan. As you know, I am conducting a thorough investigation as to what happened in Afghanistan. Mark, that troop withdrawal that went so wrong in 2021 is further in the rearview mirror now. You talked about the Gaza and there's Ukraine. The terror attack that killed 13 American service members. I imagine the president won't even bring that up tonight, right? You won't bring it up, but actually the congressman McCall is right in the sense that it is the reason why he's going to lose the election. And I'll tell you why. I don't think a single very many voters are going to walk into the voting booth thinking about the Afghan withdrawal. But that was the moment when Joe Biden's numbers tanked before the Afghan withdrawal. He had been above 50% approval in every single poll. And it was only after the Abigate bombing and the withdrawal from Afghanistan and all the lies he told Americans and telling Americans that that it was a huge success and that no one advised him to keep troops and all the rest of this. All of a sudden his approval tanked and it never recovered. And on top of that, the hits numbers for the poll started showing that people thought he was incompetent. All of this started in Afghanistan. He's our oldest president ever. There he is addressing the nation prime time, nine o'clock PM Eastern time and beyond. You have been a speechwriter. You wrote as a lead two of these state of the Union speeches for president, George W. Bush. How would you handle that tonight because it's the elephant in the room, right? People are going to be watching to see. Is he going to stumble? Is he going to look old all that? Here's the problem is that there's not really a good way you can handle it. Ronald Reagan handled the age issue by making fun of himself. He used to joke, you know, if I've given strict orders that if there's ever a crisis that people should wake me up even if it's in the middle of a cabinet meeting. He said, I'm not going to make my opponents youth in an experience and issue in this campaign. The reason he was able to do that is because it was morning in America because things were going well in the country. No one would care about Joe Biden's age or his stiffened gait or whatever if the economy was humming and the border was under control and crime was under control and peace was breaking out all over the world. But it's not the border is in chaos. The economy is not doing great as in the estimation of most Americans. Crime is everywhere and you know, the world is on fire. And so that's why people are concerned about his age. And so there's nothing, you know, speech writers are talented, but we're not miracle workers. There's no clever line you can come up with to contextualize all that. Now you dealing with this speech, let's just go to how long does this take to put together? Oh my gosh, months. I mean, months, you start working on, I mean, our state of the union addresses, if I was ever a call, we're a little bit sooner than this. Yeah. Well, this is the latest state of the union speech ever. We would start outlining the speech after Thanksgiving. We'd present the president with an outline roughly before Christmas. And then in January, we would start writing for January as soon as we got back after New Year's start writing an earnest after a few weeks, you put it through the White House staffing process, which is an opportunity for everybody to kid to comment on it. And that's enormous task in a state of union address because everybody wants to get their line. That has to be frustrating. That has to be hard. It is. And then you sort of fend off that. Then you have meetings in the Oval Office of the president where he decides what to put in, what not to put in. He starts editing the speech. And then once you got a draft that he's happy with, you go to the family theater and the residents, they have a movie theater down on the first floor of the residents. And they set up a lectern and a teleprompter in there. And he starts practicing the speech. Those start out as editing sessions, but over time, he doesn't want any more edits. He's just practicing and memorizing and working on delivery. And by the time the president delivers it, he's been, you know, he's delivered it probably 20 times. Do revisions happen up until the last day? Could they? Every president is different. There was one state of the union where Bill Clinton actually, they had been working on it so late that they loaded the wrong speech into the teleprompter. So the first 10 minutes, he just had lived the end of the union, got the right speech. That would be really, really, that would not necessarily go well if that happened to president Biden tonight. I don't think I don't think that would be a recoverable moment for him now. Now that we have talked about what you think the president can't do, right? He can't tell people what they think is different. It is a campaign year. Why not do? I mean, there's reporting that he is going to go after former president Trump and he's going to try to make him go crazy. You know, he thinks that the former president's wobbly, intellectually, emotionally, and dangerous and unpopular. Maybe just making a campaign speech and go after Trump. Can he do that? The problem is, is the state of the union addresses in a campaign speech. It's a, it's, he's supposed to appear as a statesman. I mean, you've got all the pomp and circumstance of the presidency, all the power of the bully pulpit. You know, you don't degrade that through, through pure politicization. So I'll take a perfect example as a Ukraine. If you're looking at it from a campaign perspective and you want to hit them for not supporting the Ukrainians, which the majority of Americans do, then you do what he did in that press conference a few weeks ago, he says, the Republicans in Congress needed to decide are they with freedom or they with the, with the Russian time rate? Are they, are they for the, with the Ukrainian people or are they with Donald Trump? And you sort of attack the Republicans. That's not going to help get aid passed. If you were approaching it as a statesman who wants to get aid passed, what you do is you say the Republican party has a long history of supporting freedom fighters around the world. Ronald Reagan stood at this rostrum, you know, 30 years ago and called on Congress to support freedom fighters across the world who are fighting Russian expansionism. And I call on the Republican party to live up to that great history and that great tradition when we united as a party to confront Russian expansionism. Let's do it together. This is a cause that's bigger than partisanship. This is a cause that's important for the peace of the world and the, and the security of the American people. So it'll be very telling which approach Joe Biden takes. The news reports seem to indicate he's going to take the political approach. That would be absolutely disastrous and counterproductive, but totally in character with what this administration's incompetence is like. Mark, thanks very much for joining us. My pleasure. Thanks for having me. Super Tuesday wasn't just about candidates and what happened in one California city may reflect a more widespread shift. Voters in San Francisco passed two ballot propositions aimed at addressing persistent problems, rising crime and drug use, including addiction in the homeless community with critics often blaming current conditions on progressive policies. And it all goes back to many of these new conflicting policies that have not helped with reforms. They have only made San Francisco less safe. That's mayor London breed a Democrat announcing in December she would go straight to voters. What we are introducing today is a change that is necessary, a change that recognizes that we have evolved, a change that recognizes that we want safe streets. Her proposals that want approval include drugs screening for some city welfare recipients and treatment to keep receiving cash assistance through a county program. Those sobriety is not a requirement. Changes in police policy and procedure were also approved giving officers more leeway allowing them to chase someone believed to be committing a felony or violent misdemeanor. Also allowing police to use drones facial recognition technology and to install public surveillance cameras. The San Francisco vote coming just a day after the Washington DC city council passed a crime bill that also has the effect of rolling back some progressive changes. We don't want to lock up our kids, but we might have to if they're using guns. All right, it's just that simple because not only are they using guns, they're victims of guns. DC mayor Muriel Bowser calls it common sense legislation that recognizes the importance of accountability. The DC bill makes it easier for judges to keep certain violent suspects behind bars before trial expands the definition of carjacking and creates a new crime for organized retail theft. It also allows DNA collection after arrests, but after much debate, that's limited to suspects and violent felonies and sexual assault misdemeanors and only after a judge finds probable cause. Opponents of these shifts in San Francisco and DC have some concerns and common, including of focus on penalties instead of help and the potential for disproportionate impacts on minorities. But in both cities, the votes weren't even close. Look, I think it's an important recognition of, you know, that the last few years have not been working. Raffa L. Mongual is the Nick O'Neill fellow at the Manhattan Institute. You know, the cynic in me wants to say that the election season has something to do with it, but, you know, we'll take what we can get whenever we can get it. You know, I do think these are moves in a positive direction as it as far as I would like to see these places go. No, but we got to start somewhere and I think this is a, some positive motion. There is a headline in one piece in the San Francisco Chronicle that says voters make it clear that San Francisco can no longer be called a progressive city. Is that overstating what's happening at this point though, at least in terms of, you know, reversing some of the policies that critics say have helped fuel more crime? I'd say so. I mean, it sounds to me like that headlines really just an attempt to redefine progressivism, you know, to include, you know, to sort of restrict it to anarchism, right? Even the most progressive people understand that public safety is an important component of how cities function, right? You can't have a functioning society if people cannot take for granted that they're not going to be assaulted or accosted when they leave the house. Otherwise, the economy doesn't work, right? You can't go out and participate. Everyone's stuck in their house. One of the changes in San Francisco is something that Republicans have historically proposed. A drug testing requirement for welfare recipients, it applies to single adults, no dependents. They would have an addiction specialist and treatment options if they test positive. What about the argument from opponents that this will have deadly results that some people will end up not getting benefits anymore because they just don't want to do that? Yeah, I'm not sure there's any evidence to suggest that, right? I think what they're trying to do here is we align the incentives with more positive outcomes, right? You know, here's, we're having trouble getting people into treatment, right? What can we do? Well, we can give them an incentive structure that, you know, really pushes them in this direction and say, hey, if you agree to get the kind of help that you need, which is probably going to save your life and make the city better, more habitable, et cetera, we're going to help you in these following concrete ways. You know, I actually think that makes perfect sense. Another proposal that passed in San Francisco reduces the powers of the Citizen Police Oversight Commission. The mayor says they've been micromanaging the department, but there's some other things that go along with this that are generating some controversy. For instance, more vehicle pursuits will be allowed, drones, surveillance cameras, you know, these raised safety and privacy issues for some people. Could this end up swinging the pendulum back again, then, or at this point, it really depends on whether these changes are effective? I think it depends on the degree to which the changes are effective. I think it depends on the degree to which these privacy concerns actually arise out of, you know, the use of these technologies. But, you know, provisions like that are really just a recognition of the fact that we're living in a situation in which police departments are running shortages. They are having terrible time recruiting new people into the ranks. They're having a terrible time retaining current members of the forest. And so they need to augment their efforts in every way possible. And that means, you know, taking advantage of some of the benefits that these technologies, whether it's drones or surveillance cameras, et cetera, can have. So yeah, again, this is another example that I think makes perfect sense. Are there potential, you know, privacy concerns that might arise in the future? But that's what legislatures are for, right? That's what policy makers were there for. They're there to keep an eye on things and tweak where necessary. What I think we've seen over the past several years is that whenever these concerns arise, right, the political calculus has been that, you know, well, the only political value, the politically valuable thing to do is to just blow it all up. That's what's going to, you know, drive fundraising or whatever it is. And I think, you know, we're seeing the lasting effects of that. And that ends up bringing us back to where we started in some ways. And in Washington, D.C., the city council is basically rolling back some of what had been done, giving the police more tools and therefore more power is what it boils down to, including allowing DNA samples to be collected before suspects are convicted. So they could be run through a database. Right. And there's actually good research on why that will help. The Manhattan Institute published a paper by Jennifer Dolly-Ack, who formerly of Texas tech. And now is the VP of policy at Arnold Ventures, a criminal justice reform shop, just doing a review of the literature showing that expanding DNA databases, you know, by expanding the offenses for which an arrest can result in a DNA swab actually produces crime in the long run. So, you know, these are all positive developments that are backed by evidence. They're evidence-based, as progressives like to say. You know, so again, I mean, you love to see it. It's a shame that it took this much to get us moving in this direction. But, you know, again, I think it's a positive step and I'll take what we can get. It feels like a lot's happened in a short time, though, in terms of the things that are leading to some of these reversals and partial reversals, right? I mean, it hasn't been that many years. If we go back to all the racial injustice protests of 2020, I mean, okay, we're getting to the four-year mark now. But still, does it, is that a relatively compressed time frame for things to go back and forth like this? That's nowhere near as compressed as the time frame for all the changes that took place post 2020. You know, the New York Times didn't analysis in April of 2021 showing that since the death of George Floyd between then and that point, April 2021, so about a year, something like 30 states had passed over 140 police reform bills. That's an enormous amount of movement in a very, very short period of time. I mean, in June of 2020, a governor Cuomo signed 10 different police reform bills into law just a month after George Floyd was murdered. In New York, you know, in less than a decade, we've seen bail reform in 2019, Discovery reform in 2019, raised the age in 2018. You had the parole bill, less is more in 2021. At the City Council level, you had the right to know act. You had the diaphragm law, you know, the the the stop and frist litigation. All this is like within the last decade, you know, the rewriting of the Rockefeller drug laws. I mean, the list goes on and on and on. So there's actually been quite a lot more movement to the left within the criminal justice and policing policy space that happened in a much more compressed time frame. So I would say this is really a much smaller step in in that, you know, direction to where we were compared to all the movement that's taking place. I mean, this does this doesn't come anywhere close to, you know, erasing that progress is, you know, a word I think that they would use for that. But you know, it doesn't come anywhere close to to erasing all that's been done on the reform front. New York's current Democratic governor, Kathy Hogel has championed revisions to the state's bail reforms aimed at giving judges more discretion to keep some suspects in jail. But yesterday, she turned her attention to transit crime unveiling a five point plan that includes deploying hundreds of national guard members, state police and transit police checking bags at busy New York City subway stations after a conductor was slashed in the neck last week. Let me just be very, very clear. These brazen heinous attacks on our subway system will not be tolerated. She's also proposing to ban violent offenders from the transit system. Well, again, I mean, it is, it's pretty amazing what an election season will do to politicians who have previously spent a lot of their political capital moving us in a direction that I think a lot of people would say has undermined policing and public safety, not just in the subways or in the city of New York, but in the country writ large. I mean, again, you know, she deserves credit for recognizing that there's a problem and taking affirmative steps to address that problem. You know, I do worry about the degree to which, you know, national guardsmen who aren't really trained police officers, you know, don't have been trained within the subways system right? Don't necessarily understand the intricacies of the subway system. I'd much rather see a larger investment in the transit bureau of the NYPD to hire more high qualified officers who are going to be specifically trained to do this kind of work. Commissioner Bill Bratton, who first came to New York as chief of the transit police department when there was a separate department from the NYPD recently tweeted, while he commends Governor Hogan's initiative here, you know, it's important to understand that the NYPD's transit bureau is operating with something like a thousand fewer officers than he had when he was chief of the transit department in 1990. So, you know, I think the problems that we have are very clear, they're very clearly traceable to two things and that is an undermining of the efforts of the police that we have both through a reduction in their overall four sizes, but also just in the additional restrictions that they have to face, right? Again, you know, police officers can make an arrest anywhere in the city are still subject to criminal penalties if they simply put pressure on somebody's diaphragm back or chest or neck in any way, even if they didn't mean to do that and even if that suspect is actively resisting. On the issue of police tactics, I did want to ask you about the revision in the DC bill. They revised the definition of an officer chokehold. That is something the police union wanted. How did that come to fruition when there's still so much tension on that issue? And do you think that that is indicative of, you know, other changes that could be coming? Yeah, I mean, my understanding of the revision, it's it's it's not, you know, it's just addressing the vast vagueness in the in the provision as it stands right now. So, it's not legalizing, you know, all all neck restraints. But the reality is that there's actually a good bit of research on the use of neck restraints. They're not particularly deadly, they're not particularly dangerous. They're a very effective grappling technique that could actually help deescalate and yeah, that that sounds weird to people, right? When they hear, well, how can a chokehold deescalate right? Isn't that escalated? It's like, well, if you don't effectively grapple a resisting suspect, that suspect may be able to get to a gun or to a weapon. And that interaction may now devolve to a point of more serious force than a chokehold actually being used where you could have avoided all that by effectively holding that person down. You know, so, so I think this is one of these examples where we have to trust the men and women who are actually tasked with arresting people. They know what they're doing. They know what they're talking about. Does that mean that, you know, they don't ever abuse their authority, of course not? Does that mean that there shouldn't be any oversight? Of course not. But we should be guided by research and evidence. Raphael Mungual with the Manhattan Institute. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Made the American Who First Achieved Staten Hood. Elizabeth Ann Bailey was born August 28, 1774 in colonial New York City, despite being a melting pot of new settlers. New York City was on the brink of rebellion and battling infectious disease. Bailey's parents were prominent members of the Episcopal Church and her father Richard was the city's first chief health officer. In 1794, Elizabeth married William McGee-Setan. And shortly after he fell ill, a few short years later in 1803, the young couple traveled to Italy with their eldest daughter, Anna Maria, to hopefully aid his recovery. However, Setan died of tuberculosis two days after Christmas. Elizabeth and her daughter returned to New York as devout Catholics to the horror of her close friends and family. On March 14, 1805, Bailey was received into St. Peter's Church and made her first communion 11 days later. At the time, St. Peter's was the only Catholic Church in New York City. After being ousted by her friends and family, Elizabeth moved her five children to Maryland where she devoted her life to Christ. She would go on to form a Catholic school for girls and the first sisterhood in the United States, sisters of charity of St. Joseph's, who would go on to send missions across the United States. In 1934, her sister Gertrude Corzendorfer of New Orleans made a full recovery from pancreatic cancer deemed inoperable by doctors after besieging the aid of mother Elizabeth Anne. Then, Anne Teresa O'Neill, just four years old, was cured of acute lymphatic leukemia in Baltimore on Easter week in 1952, most famously in 1963, a 61-year-old Carl Callan awoke from a coma after a sliver of Elizabeth's bone was brought to the hospital to reinforce the prayers. She died on January 4, 1821 in Emmett's Burg Maryland at just 46 years old. 201 years after she was born, mother Elizabeth Anne Ceton was canonized on September 4, 1975, after becoming the first woman saint. The incredible acts of healing, each one unexplained by science, propelled her to st. hood more than a century after a brief life filled with incredible drama and achievement. The obstacle course facing President Biden's state-of-the-union address tonight presents a formidable challenge. It may prove difficult for the 81-year-old President to navigate. Expectations could not be lower. Biden faces the usual challenges of exaggerating his poultry policy winds, justifying his substantial missteps and attacking his political opponents. But those questions may be overshadowed by more basic ones. Can he make it from start to finish gaff-free? Will we be able to understand his words? Will this be one of the shortest addresses ever? Will he even be able to find his way offstage? Keep in mind, if you have a senior moment, this time, the Easter Bunny won't be there to save him. We need a commander-in-chief who can negotiate. In this case, negotiate the steps to the podium, a smaller teleprompter, and staying awake after sundown. But there are also very real questions about his ability to negotiate to avoid war in the Middle East, deescalate conflict in Ukraine, stop millions from pouring over our borders, including countless criminals, and preserve our access to affordable energy and healthcare. Perhaps he pulls it off, but a two-minute video released on his ex-accounted February raised eyebrows when readers identified at least 29 jump cuts. That raises the question, can Biden still form coherent sentences in a live setting? And for how long? Will he ad-lib and start dishing out a Kamala Harris-style word-salad? Despite more ciferous assurances from the press secretary Karin John Pierre that he passes a cognitive test every day, he likewise seems to generate new questions about his competence, nearly as often. His obvious cognitive decline is being lampooned around the world, including a recent viral skit from Italy. The justification to elect President Biden was supposed to be his ability to work with Congress, where he served for decades. We were told he could bring the nation together, working with world leaders he claims he knows so well. But on all those fronts, after three years, President Biden has failed. No doubt Biden will predictably point blame at Republicans. They'll take numerous shots at Donald Trump. That's cheap, easy, and definitely going to happen. It is an election year after all, but Biden's biggest obstacle will be his tenuous relationship with reality and truth. Gaslighting is his best hope. Biden will claim a vibrant economy, but no matter what his manipulated statistics say, Americans know their own budgets. Biden will blame climate change for everything, including the flood of illegal border crossers. Americans know that is not true. He will say democracy is under attack, but America is aware that Democrats are the ones trying to prohibit his opponent from even being on the ballot. Biden will use the best of what his speech writers have to offer. They will attempt bold, verbal gymnastics to gaslight Americans about his Israel policies, his equity agenda, his open support of censorship and more. But it will all be at odds with truth and reality, and increasing numbers of Americans see it. And despite his shouting, mixed with occasional whispering, Americans will recognize that the guy first elected in 1972 is out of gas.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"3_biden_know_president\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"3_biden_know_president\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[8.099884033203125,8.015508651733398,8.184502601623535,8.355164527893066,7.335470676422119,8.560647010803223,8.506172180175781,7.784471035003662,8.10522747039795],\"y\":[9.92094612121582,10.10131549835205,9.680861473083496,9.895111083984375,9.400321960449219,9.759871482849121,9.835028648376465,9.966680526733398,9.820016860961914],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"Hey what's news listeners, it's Sunday March 3rd. I'm Luke Vargas. This is what's news Sunday, the show where we tackle the big questions about the biggest stories in the news. We reach out to our colleagues across the newsroom to help explain what's happening in our world. This week, we're answering your questions about how social media is affecting kids. What platforms are doing to limit known harms for young people's mental health, and whether the government needs to intervene, and if so, how. You ready? Let's get right to it. When we asked you to share your concerns about social media's influence on kids, we heard back about a wide array of issues, from bullying and constant screen time to the formation of potentially addictive habits. And add to that, reporting on how social media can worsen teens' body image, make them targets of sexual harassment, and increase their exposure to content related to self-harm and racism, and it can feel overwhelming to parents to consider what ought to be done to make social media a safer place. Social media companies, including Meta and TikTok, have said they're committed to making sure their platforms are safe for kids. Meta told us it wants to help teens have safe, positive experiences on its apps. TikTok, X, and Apple did not respond to our requests for comment. As for government regulation, that is on the table. More on that later. But first, I'm joined by Julie Jargon, the journal's family and tech columnist, and reporter Jeff Horwitz, who covers Meta and led coverage of the award-winning Facebook files investigation. Jeff at a Senate hearing in January met a CEO Mark Zuckerberg, said the following. Mental health is a complex issue, and the existing body of scientific work has not shown a cause-a-link between using social media and young people having more mental health outcomes. Jeff, that comes after the US Surgeon General last year issued a public advisory warning about social media's risks for young people, citing this growing body of research on the detrimental effects for adolescents amid a national youth mental health crisis. So, to what extent are social media companies aware of those concerns? So, while I can't speak for everyone, there is unquestionably a large body of publicly available research outlining some of these issues, and then the stuff that we have obtained from inside Meta Facebook and Instagram research into things like notifications that, you know, Meta would sort of send. Basically, if they hadn't been checking the app enough per Meta's sensibility, those things were sort of geared toward increasing a fear of missing out and of kind of side-tracking kids from what they've been doing. And then there's also things, and the body image front as well, they did a lot of research into beauty filters, which the research found was bad for both the people posting them because they knew they didn't actually look like their online persona, and also bad for the people who saw them, because they definitely didn't look like the enhanced image of the people they were viewing. In terms of the techniques, Jeff, that social media companies use to drive engagement, you talked about systems built to maximize attention, to trigger FOMO, and I want to play a question that we received from one of our listeners, Mateo Guillemont. Here it is. Given that we've seen the research shows they're using addictive strategies to hook miners onto their platforms, you can consider these companies almost like gaming companies as a casino, for example, or online betting platform. Jeff, I should note, Mateo goes on to ask about regulation, but just on that claim about the use of addictive strategies to hook miners. Is that something that has been proven? The platforms themselves have been by their own acknowledgement, designing products to be stickier to involve people spending more time on them, and that is going to definitely involve some of the same interactions and dopamine rewards that slot machines provide, right? The analogy is not a bad one. It's actually part of a multi-state lawsuit claiming that meta designed its products to capitalize on how young users, brains, work, meta told us it doesn't design its products to be stickier and to encourage users to spend more time on them. Nevertheless, social media does have an impact, something you usually have reported on extensively. What has jumped out to you in the course of your reporting about how all of this is impacting families? Well, I think in terms of families, the major concern is that parents feel fairly helpless here. They feel like they're competing against an algorithm that is more efficient and effective than they are in shaping their children's online behavior. And they don't know how to get around that, short of not allowing their children to be on any of these platforms at all. So, once the kids are on social media, they're at a loss to figure out how to limit the time that they spend on these platforms and also restrict the type of content that they're seeing. It can be very confusing for parents to understand what an algorithm is showing their kids, and even though there are tools that the social media companies have developed to try to assist with this, it could be very cumbersome to set up. And of course, nothing is foolproof, and kids can find workarounds to anything parents do anyway. And on what Julie said there just to follow up, a lot of platforms make a big deal about the parental controls. It's true they exist, and they should exist. That said, the widely understood secret inside of most of the companies is that the idea that even the most helicoptering parent is going to be able to keep track of their child's digital footprint is fairly implausible. Julie, let me follow up on that because we heard from a listener, Nathan Beechy, who had this question about tools out there to help kids and really anyone control their experience on social media. Let's play that. I was wondering if there'd be a way for social media companies to use screen limiters or timers to enforce that individuals couldn't be on their platform for more than certain time each day. When you're reporting, you've referred to these types of tools when they're used to regulate children's time on social media as childproofing tools. Just remind us if you could what tools are out there and if they're considered safe. Well, the social media platforms themselves do have a number of tools, some of which can limit the amount of time. Kids spend on them, some are more in the lines of sort of content filtering where you can go in and pick certain hashtags that would be contained in videos that you might not want your child to see. They have a lot of tools that are not necessarily inherently bad, but like Jeff was saying, they're hard to use. They're hidden in the settings. They're not intuitive. And you're talking about several different social media apps that your kids might have across different devices. Then there are also device level settings that parents can use such as on Apple devices. And those have not worked very well either. Everett and about Apple's screen time settings, which allow parents to set time limits for their kids and do some other filtering. And there have been sinking problems across the parents devices and their kids devices that have made those settings come undone. So there's no certainty that parents can have that anything that they set up either sticks or that their kids can't find workarounds to. And Apple has said it will continue to make updates and improve that situation. Meta says that it's added 30 different tools and features to help parents and teens. But Julie, beyond these types of tools, what else are our social media companies doing in response to many of the concerns we've been talking about here? One of the recent moves that Meta has taken with Instagram is that they are going to automatically filter certain types of content from teen accounts. So certain body image related, like eating disorder related content, graphic violence, things like that. They're going to filter from getting to teen accounts. And again, teens can get around that if they feel like they're not seeing the stuff they used to see on their feeds. They can create a different account. They can lie about their age. And that gets into all of the kind of the big picture questions about how do you regulate this? For their part, social media companies like Meta, Jeff, have indicated they would like the government to take the lead on any regulations. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Senators at a hearing in January, he supports quote, setting industry standards on age, appropriate content. But Jeff, beyond what we've been discussing here, are there additional steps that social media companies could take if they wish to? Oh, vastly. There are steps that could be taken here. Look, this stuff wasn't designed for what parents would want. Or even what teens necessarily would want if you asked them. It was designed for the benefit of the companies. So a few things that definitely could be considered. First one is just what level of contact with the outside world you want to have. Do you want kids trying to go viral and being reached by basically anyone in the world? That is a product design choice. There's the question of what type of content gets recommended. And if you're doing it without much of an idea of what actually is being pushed. I mean, Julie mentioned the goal of not recommending awful things to kids. But the systems inside these companies are not good enough to reliably do that. There are a bunch of ways that you could make the product something that most parents would probably be more comfortable with. But it also would not be as good for usage of these products. And that's something that it's very hard to imagine the company is wanting to undertake voluntarily. Reporter Jeff Horowitz covers meta and social media platforms for us. Jeff, Julie, thank you both so much. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Coming up, we'll shift this conversation to Washington to see how lawmakers are approaching potential regulations around kids and social media with the Brookings institutions Nicole Turner Lee. That's after a short break. Hey, what's news fans? Listen up. That's right. But that's not all. So we know they definitely have something for you. And it's already included in your prime membership. That's Amazon.com slash what's news. It's just that easy. Well, we've heard your concerns now about how social media is affecting children and some of what social media companies are or aren't doing to address those issues. But what about the role of regulators and lawmakers? Current federal legislation protects children's personal information lays out rules for what you can or cannot do online and sets out some expectations for how companies handle data. But that said, most of these laws were implemented before the proliferation of social media we see today. Nicole Turner Lee is the director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the nonprofit Brookings Institution where she steers research on tech policymaking. Nicole, we are going to talk about the potential for new legislation regulating social media. Many of these companies have said that they want the government to craft regulations. Is that something lawmakers could actually look to do? There's a general understanding today and quite obvious among some of the previous legislation that a threshold of a minor at 13 and under is basically one that most people buy into. The challenge is without age assurance a 13 year old could be online on a site that is designed for an 18 year old. There have been calls to sort of raise the age limit to 16. Like my daughter says it's like the driving limit of online platforms, right? But the challenge with the online space is that somebody has to verify that, right? There's going to be a parent that's going to be able to come on over and say, oh yeah, baby, let me push this button for you because you are at the right age. We're finding that that's not the case. There's some legislation that is suggesting we should have documentation. And then there's another interesting discussion that sort of has entered the stage here, which are young people who are going to the internet for protection and safety. Young people from the LGBTQ community who may not have told their parents that they're out but yet are going online to find a comfort group, trans kids. You know, these are like real issues which suggest to me this is not your grandmother's family household anymore, right? Not at all. And we actually heard from one listener Nicole Jordan who is wrestling with a very contemporary concern, wanting her kids to be tech savvy but also not exposed to content that would keep them glued to their screens. She told us that her soon to be 11 year old could soon get a paired down cell phone that doesn't include the internet or other apps. And there are a lot of companies out there making devices like this. Could there be something similar for social media? Well, I mean, here's the deal. When I was younger, my mother told me I couldn't listen to certain records and I still did. You know, we can get away with scaled down technology with our toddlers. I'm not sure if we can get away with that when we start dealing with our adolescents. We once did a podcast at Brookings where we bought young people on one of them, which was my daughter. And we asked them like, who's responsible for this? Do parents need to do more? Do we need to scale it down? And essentially they said we spend most of our high school education learning how to drive, but we don't learn about media. We don't have the digital literacy training. We won't give people the tools that they need to properly engage. And more importantly, we may actually intrude on children's rights. They're right to be able to be creative and ideate and other things that comes with these new technologies. Alright, so more education, more awareness needed here, but just going back to what you said earlier. If you can't regulate kids usage of the record playher or in this case, social media, how much can really be done here? We had one listener, Zoe Butler, Colin wondering what is actually politically feasible? I'm skeptical about bipartisan support for regulating social media for teens. I want to know the ways that these pieces of legislation play into the larger appetite for regulating big tech and social media algorithms. Nicole, be honest with us is bipartisan regulation on social media for children realistically within reach now. I mean, I think the ecosystem in which we have now when it comes to tech policy is still pretty disparate. We have various agencies asserting jurisdiction over parts of the ecosystem. You know, I think there is possibly more interest in children's privacy, believe it or not, than we're actually acknowledging. We've seen several bipartisan bills hit the floor. If we really want to hit children's privacy, we've got to hit privacy in general. Compared to the EU, the United States doesn't have a comprehensive data privacy standard. And that then allows for a wild west in terms of what can be collected on people in general. We do need to look at our outdated children's privacy laws, some of the things that are already pre-existing, and see if they actually function well in a 21st century economy. My point is, legislators can do something, the challenge that we have, and the Congress that we have, it's still under term in what they will do. Nicole Turnerley is the director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Nonprofit Brookings Institution. Nicole, thank you so much for taking on these big questions with us. Thank you so much and I'm glad we got through it because these are really difficult questions. And that's it for what's new Sunday for March 3rd. Today's show was produced by Charlotte Gartenberg with supervising producer Sandra Kylhoff. We got help from Jonathan Sanders, Anthony Bansy, and Kate Bollivan, as well as Deputy Editor Scott Saloway, and Chris Sinsley. I'm Luke Vargas, and you'll hear from me again with a new show right here tomorrow morning. Until then, enjoy the rest of your Sunday. Thanks for listening.\",\" Today, Putin wins in a landslide and issues fresh warnings over Ukraine. Malaysia McDonald's takes a boycott Israel group to court. And Japan prepares for an historic change of direction on interest rates. It's Monday, March 18th. This is Reuters World News, bringing you everything you need to know from the front lines in 10 minutes every weekday. I'm Kim Van Al in London. This episode is brought to you by UI Path. Today, 90% of the Fortune 500 are accelerating human achievements simply. With UI Path, the world's number one AI-powered business automation platform, UI Path, the foundation of innovation. Vladimir Putin has won a landslide in Russia's election, cementing his tight grip on power. The victory gives him a new six-year term as president, and we'll see him overtake Joseph Stalin as Russia's longest-serving leader for more than 200 years if he completes it. Good evening. Please. Putin won almost 88% of the vote, the highest ever in Russia's post-Soviet history. According to an exit poll by the Public Opinion Foundation. He told supporters in Moscow that he would prioritize what he calls Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, and that he would strengthen the Russian military. I think that's all possible in the modern world. But I've already said that it's clear for everyone. He also told the journalists that the presence of Western troops in Ukraine could push the world to the brink of World War III. He added he did not think that anyone was interested in such a scenario. The White House said the elections were not free or fair with Germany calling it a pseudo-election. So what does this mean for Russia and the world? Andrew Osborne has been covering the election. On the face of it, another six years of Putin means more war in Ukraine, because there's no sign at all that Putin wants to stop. In fact, the demands, if anything, the territorial demands seem to be growing. We're also going to see a continuation clearly of this confrontation with the West, which is certainly the most tense it's been since the Cuba missile crisis in 1962. And what it also means we're going to hear and see a lot more of this nuclear tension and saber-attling, which is obviously destabilizing and worrying. I think the only wildcard in all of this is, of course, the American election, the US election in November, because if Donald Trump were to win that election, it's quite unclear right now how that could, for example, affect the war in Ukraine. Trump has clearly made some statements suggesting he would not be as supportive of Ukraine as Biden would. And that, of course, could mean that the course of the war is different and therefore that Putin himself might behave in a different way. But that's an unknown and we'll have to wait and see clearly. Overvoting weekend, Ukrainian forces killed at least four people in shelling and missile strikes in and around the Russian border city of Belgorod. Rotis could not independently verify all of those reports. Ukraine, like Russia, says it does not target civilians. But scores of Russian civilians have been killed in Belgorod in the two years of war, and air raid sirens wail almost daily. Here, like in Ukraine, civilian groups collect supplies to send to the front line. Galina is among them. She's collecting hygiene items and tools for digging trenches. And she says that while she wants the water end, she, like many others, still supports Putin. Israel is offering a six week Gaza truce in exchange for 40 hostages. It says it will send a delegation to Qatar for talks with Hamas. The negotiations are expected to last two weeks. Meanwhile, Israel has raided Gaza's al-Shifa hospital, killing several people, according to Palestinian health authorities. An Israeli army spokesperson says the hospital was being used by senior Hamas leaders. The hospital is one of the few remaining health facilities left in the enclave. Vietnam's parliament is set to meet this week amid speculation the president may step down. The communist-ruled country will hold a special session to discuss, quote, personnel matters, according to a letter seen by Reuters. China's kicked off the week with better than expected economic numbers. Industrial output and retail sales were up in January and February. A bright spot even adds weakness in the property sector still drags. Beijing is aiming for a 5% GDP growth target this year. The US-China Sea Across the East China Sea in Japan, a significant economic shake-up is on the cards this week. The Bank of Japan may raise interest rates for the first time since 2007. If it does, it will mean Sianara to the world's last negative interest rate and a big jolt for Japan Inc. Lake Ikahara has been following every twist and turn at the Bank of Japan for some two decades. So, Lake at how significant would a rate hike be? Yeah, Japan has been seeing interest rates stucca, essentially zero for a very long time. So people here are so used to not having to pay any money to borrow. So even though the interest rate hikes might be very small, it could have a huge psychological impact on households or companies because they might fear that their mortgage rates might rise or their lending costs might rise. Why is it taken Japan so long to get to this point? Because companies and people are so used to having very low growth and very low wages. But that's finally changing because inflation has been up for a long time and the labor shortage is really intensifying. And companies are now finally offering pretty big pay hikes to compensate employees for the rising cost of living. What are the risks for the Bank of Japan and Japan generally from this potential move? The move could cause a big market reaction and disrupt markets such as pushing down stocks or pushing up the yen. And volatility always isn't very good for companies doing business. Mediation talks are set to continue after a lawsuit brought by McDonald's Malaysia against the local chapter of the Boycott Israel movement known as BDS. Shortly after the October 7th attack by Hamas, McDonald's locally owned Israeli restaurants donated meals to the Israeli military. But the company says that's up to local branches and it doesn't have a stance in the conflict. It wants $1.3 million from BDS saying the Boycott has damaged their business. A hearing on Monday failed to reach an agreement. Wailon Cunningham covers fast food. Wailon, have these Boycot's hurt McDonald's? Yeah, these Boycot's have been a really big deal for McDonald's. And actually a couple of days ago, its chief financial officer said the company expects its international sales to drop in this current quarter, doing part to these Boycot's again. What's McDonald's corporate saying about all this? McDonald's corporate says that they can't really control what their franchises do. McDonald's corporate has tried to really stay out of taking a stance on Israel's military offensive in Gaza saying that the CEO said that the company abhor is violence of any kind. So they're really trying to signal to the consumers and investors that they are neutral in it. But McDonald's local franchises have put out statements clearly putting them on one side. And other Western fast food chains have seen similar Boycot's over a perceived pro-Israel stance, especially in some Arab countries. What's the strategy of this campaign? What's actually interesting is that BDS Malaysia put out a statement recently that said it welcomes the lawsuit. Because what's more important to a lot of these organizers is raising awareness of their campaign against Israel's military offensive in Gaza. Any news is good news when it comes to getting this stuff into headlines. This Boycott has been really heavy in countries like Egypt, where political demonstrations in public aren't really feasible due to security concerns. But Boycot's are a safe way for consumers to be able to express their dissatisfaction, or even just to express a stance about the conflict. That's it for today's episode. We'll of course be back tomorrow with our daily headline show. If you want to stay ahead of the big news from around the world, listen in for 10 minutes every week day.

Plus federal prosecutors investigate Meta for potentially profiting from drug sales, and China tries to lure back foreigners, but is its charm offensive enough? There's a lot more at stake here beyond just being liked. Foreign investment inflows last year fell 8%, and that's the first decline in 10 years. So Beijing really needs to address this slide. It's Monday, March 18th. The top headlines and business stories moving your world, today. We begin in Russia, where, as predicted, Vladimir Putin has claimed victory in the country's general election, securing another six-year term in office with 88% of the vote. The inevitable result came after a carefully managed re-election campaign that saw opposition candidates sidelined. Putin's most effective opponent, Alexei Navalny, was also out of the picture, having been found dead in an Arctic prison camp last month in circumstances that haven't been fully explained. Political analysts say that Putin's fifth term in office is likely to be taken up by the war in Ukraine and ensuring the continued support from the Russian people. Meanwhile, Ukraine is beginning to report success in exporting grain, following a halt in maritime shipments after Russia's 2022 invasion. And though the UN and Turkey subsequently brokered a Black Sea grain deal, Ukraine said that Russia was using inspections to slow down shipments. Our James Marson in Kiev says that makes a recent increase in exports a bright spot as the country contends with stalled US aid and recent setbacks on the battlefield. Something changed last summer. Ukraine actually managed to blast a path of its own using unconventional sea power, so they used naval drones to attack Russia's Black Sea fleet. The Ukrainians sunk several warships and forced the Russian fleet out large parts of the Black Sea. That created what the Ukrainians are calling a new corridor that's allowed ships to start taking out grain again. And that's brought export levels almost back to where they were before the war. That's a huge boost for Ukraine's economy. The economy ministry estimates it will add about $3.3 billion to exports this year and 1.2 percentage points to economic growth. And while the situation in the Black Sea could change, James said that officials are hopeful that they've put the grain industry on a sustainable path. A key part of getting the grain corridor working has been insurance. The Ukrainian government work with international insurers to help grain ships sailing to and from Ukraine to find affordable coverage. At first, the ships that were coming were smaller ships, but as confidence has grown, the ships have grown in size. This has been a big military success for Ukraine that has had important economic consequences. Andrei Stavnitser, whose company operates one of Odessa's ports, called it a showcase of power that's communicated with Russia in a language that it understands. He also defended plans for a possible invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, citing the risk that Hamas fighters left there could regroup. Speaker 4: That's not going to happen. So we need total victory over Hamas. We're within reach, we should do it. We're going to do it while we enable the civilian population in Rafah to leave, as we've done up to now, but we have to finish the job. Cuba witnessed its largest anti-regime demonstrations since 2021 yesterday as hundreds of protesters took to the streets in two cities, driven by anger over blackouts and a lack of food. Cuba's state-run telecom company responded by curtailing mobile internet service on parts of the island, complicating efforts to get news of the demonstrations out to the rest of the country. The US embassy in Havana urged the government to address the legitimate needs of the Cuban people, while Cuba's president said the protests were the result of the US embargo. And in a blow to the Biden administration's counterterrorism efforts in West Africa, we are exclusively reporting that Niger has cut military ties with the US after Washington accused it of secretly exploring a deal to let Iran access its uranium reserves. A spokesman for Niger's junta, which seized power in July, denied any deal with Iran, and accused the US of trying to prevent it from choosing its own diplomatic partners. A spokesman for Iran's UN mission in New York declined to comment. Since last year's coup, Niger has tightened ties with Russia, as well as with neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso, both of which are ruled by generals aligned with Moscow. The world's second-largest economy is hungry for foreigners. Before the pandemic, China's financial capitals were teeming with international visitors and expats, and students flocked to the country's universities to study Mandarin, with many staying behind to pursue lucrative careers. But as Journal reporter, Liza Lin, reports, China's Allure has faded, with the number of registered foreign citizens dropping sharply in recent years, following COVID lockdowns and a government crackdown on businesses. And that has now led Beijing to roll out a charm offensive in a bid to shed its increasing isolation. Liza, everyone likes to be liked, of course, but maybe the same goes for countries as well. But tell us about why the stakes here are about more than just China's image? There's a lot more at stake here beyond just being liked. Firstly, China could really use the economic boost that overseas investment and tourism brings. Economic growth in China was sluggish last year, and the country is battling a real slump in consumer confidence. To just give you some perspective, foreign investment inflows last year fell 8%, and that's the first decline in 10 years, so Beijing really needs to address this slide. For example, when foreign expats and executives come to China, they bring skills and knowledge to the country that China needs to advance its business and manufacturing sectors. I think more broadly as well, the longer-term expats we've interviewed say a lack of foreign interest could possibly lead to a deepening of mistrust between China and the world, and now's really not the time for it. All right. So lots of potential consequences there. And as you say, China has stepped in here with a so-called charm offensive to try and turn the situation around. What form is that taking? Yeah. So people kind of call this period a post-COVID hangover. China had shut its borders for so long during the pandemic years that tourists just don't think about China anymore when they think about traveling somewhere. And within China itself, you had these really strict city lockdowns, that because of COVID, have paralyzed entire regions, and that's led to a huge outflow of expats and also manufacturing companies who were worried about their supply chains. China recognizes this exodus, and they've been taking steps to address it. I think the biggest one they've taken is really to waive off visa requirements for 15 countries over the past year. So for example, if you were a resident of France or Germany, you don't need a visa to go into China anymore. And to make it more appealing for longer-term expats, China's also extended tax breaks. And for foreign companies looking to expand in China, Beijing has promised to break down market barriers and just do more to smooth out any challenges hindering them there. I would imagine those assurances to businesses will take a little time to actually lead to any changes in business practices, Liza, but I am curious if some of those steps you've talked about are starting to show any effect yet? Yes. We're seeing some really early positive signs. So for example, the number of tourists are up, and not just tourists, the business travelers, too. This group was hit pretty hard during the pandemic, because if you remember, China made all incoming travelers quarantine for two weeks before entering the country, and that was hugely unpopular. The business travelers are coming also because China's hosting more international exhibitions. The other promising thing to note is that the US and China will increase direct flights between the two countries at the end of the month, so it's going from 35 flights each week to 50 direct flights each week. But beyond that, I think there are also signs that it will take a while for businesses to return. Yeah. And not to mention that no less than the US State Department is actively discouraging for an engagement with China. Beijing really facing some big headwinds here. Yeah. So the overall geopolitical situation is really not helping. The State Department has put out a travel advisory on China, basically asking its citizens to reconsider travel to China because of the risk of exit bans or wrongful detention. And in Washington DC itself, the topic of China engagement is now very, very toxic. A lot of US businesses have come under scrutiny over their China ties. So while we were researching this story, we spoke to many people living in China, or people who have left China as well, and I think there was one US business executive in Beijing who really put it best. This person says China has a long way to go before it can restore the broken trust from over the last few years. Liza, thanks so much for bringing us this story. Thanks for having me, Luke. Coming up, federal prosecutors probe whether Meta's social media platforms are facilitating drug sales, and a key free speech case heads to the Supreme Court. Those stories and more after the break. Shares of both Nissan and Honda have risen sharply this morning after the Japanese automaker said they were teaming up on electric vehicles as part of an effort to compete with rivals in China and the US such as BYD and Tesla. People at the companies said Nissan and Honda have faced pressure from Japanese officials to work more closely together to achieve economies of scale. The rally in both automakers comes amid broader gains in Japanese stocks ahead of a hotly anticipated rate decision from the Bank of Japan tomorrow, where analysts and investors expect the BOJ to raise rates. The historic move comes as Japan's economy kicks into higher gear, following years of negative interest rates as the BOJ sought to combat economic stagnation and persistent deflation. Now to a journal exclusive, as we've learned that federal authorities are investigating Meta platforms for its role in drug sales. Salvador Rodriguez covers Meta for the Journal. In my own exploration of Facebook, it's not tough to find a marijuana for sale on Facebook Marketplace, for example, or magic mushrooms. We've heard of situations where folks are selling ingredients to make drugs wholesale, or selling steroids, selling counterfeit pills. It seems to be a pretty wide problem. US prosecutors have reportedly sent subpoenas as part of a criminal grand jury probe, looking into whether Facebook and Instagram are facilitating and profiting from the illegal sale of drugs. A way that Meta could potentially profit theoretically is if someone places an ad, which Meta draws revenue from, to draw attention to their personal account or maybe their page. And then if they are using those pages or accounts to conduct those kinds of sales, that would be one situation where Meta is indirectly profiting. Meta has said that the sale of illicit drugs is against its policies, and that it's working to find and remove such content from its services, while also assisting law enforcement authorities in helping combat the sale and distribution of such drugs. The prosecutor's office declined to comment. And to hear much more on this story, check out the latest episode of Tech News Briefing wherever you get your podcasts. The Supreme Court today will hear a key case on free speech. Under scrutiny is the White House's strategy for fighting what it said was misinformation about vaccines, COVID lockdowns, and other public health efforts in a time of crisis. The lawsuit led by the Republican attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana alleges that the federal government engaged in censorship by unlawfully pressuring tech companies to suppress posts opposed to vaccines. It is the latest in a series of cases that could set important ground rules for digital free speech and content moderation. The Biden administration argues that the plaintiffs have exaggerated the government's influence, while Google, Meta, and X haven't taken sides in the litigation. And a new wave of tech is changing how some women view and even use their monthly cycles in their favor. Biohacking is the phenomenon where women monitor their menstrual cycles with a range of different wearables and apps to determine how hormones may affect their daily lives. And although women tracking their periods is nothing new, health and fitness freelance reporter, Caitlin Carlson, says the technology is booming. So the word empowering came up quite a few times during my early interviews with the women who are doing this, and they're finding that instead of dreading how their cycle makes them feel, they can actually adjust their routines to work with the ups and downs, tweaking everything from their nutrition, to their workouts, even their social schedules and how they run their businesses based on their cycles. For example, some women do lower-intensity workouts when they're in their luteal phase. That's when some women may feel less energetic due to hormonal fluctuations. Another woman told me that she tries to schedule dates when she knows she'll be feeling more social based on where she is in her cycle. Another woman does something similar for work, aiming to pitch clients during ovulation in her follicular face. And that's What's News for Monday morning. Today's show was produced by Kate Bullivant and Hattie Moyer. We will be back tonight with a new show. And until then, thanks for listening. Another top female executive at Goldman Sachs is leaving, adding to an exodus of women. Anna  The issue we've been looking into and porting on is what happens after women are made partners, and that's where a lack of advancement into the firm's most senior ranks becomes evident. And how an obscure server maker had a better year than Nvidia, plus former President Donald Trump says he can't secure a bond to cover a $454 million civil fraud judgment. It's Monday, March 18th. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. Believe it or not, there's a tech company that had a better year than chip maker Nvidia. It's Super Micro Computer, A once-under-the-radar server maker that's become a $60 billion company. Super Micro Computer joined the S&P 500 today and is by far the index's top one-year performer. Sales of its servers equipped with Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips are projected to double its revenue this year. Clearly the AI boom is not over yet and people are still investing heavily in this kind of stuff. That's no surprise. Another interesting thing it says is that there's a lot of demand out there for very custom AI kind of solutions, if you will, within the industry. But what it means is different types of AI need different types of computing power. Somebody who's developing a self-driving car technology might need a different kind of computing setup than somebody who's doing a large language model like a ChatGPT, which OpenAI does. And the thing that Super Micro does that distinguishes itself from competitors is that it uses what it calls a \\\"building block\\\" approach to build its servers. So because it has these kinds of building blocks, it can kind of put together things into any number of configurations for people, create an almost semi-custom kind of infrastructure and people like that these days. So that's another thing that this reveals about the AI boom is that people really like to have custom kind of infrastructure for their AI computing needs and those needs continue to grow. You can hear more on this story on today's episode of our Tech News Briefing podcast. Donald Trump's lawyers say he's been unable to secure a bond to guarantee payment of a $454 million civil fraud judgment ordered against him last month. In a filing to a New York Appeals Court, the former president said the judgment was so big that suretors wouldn't accept real estate as collateral and would require cash to guarantee the bond. Suretors guarantee the debt and would undertake paying it if Trump doesn't. Trump has asked a New York appellate court to waive the bond requirement while he appeals the judgment, arguing that paying now would cause him irreparable harm. If the court turns down his request and he's unable to obtain a bond, New York Attorney General Letitia James could begin enforcing the judgment next week. The judgment stems from a ruling that found Trump falsely valued parts of his real estate empire for financial gain. The judge imposed $355 million in penalties plus interest, meaning Trump's debt is growing daily. US lawmakers are staring down another deadline Friday to pass six remaining bills to avert a partial government shutdown. Yes, again. You may remember the last time this happened, it was earlier this month. Well, even with that deal, there were still a couple of unfinished bills on the table and now it's about time for lawmakers to take care of them too. Welcome back, Katy. Katy  Thanks for having me. Okay, Katy, I have this question and I'm sure our listeners may as well. How in the world are we staring down another potential government shutdown?Katy  I know. We've been on shutdown watch since September. Congress has just been kicking the can on these deadlines. I mean, they face an annual deadline by September 30th to figure out what the budget, split up the budget for federal agencies the next year. And we've had a lot of chaos and they've had to move deadlines several times and Congress has waited, quite frankly, to the last minute to give themselves what amounted to four extensions on their homework. And so we are in yet another shutdown week. We've just had a lot of deadlines and they haven't finished it. What is left on the to-do list is very small and we are down to a few limited fights. And while we do have a shutdown, that deadline and while some funding would expire for federal agencies after Friday night, if nothing is passed, I do feel like once they pull through, we have a little bit of a break on shutdown watch. So what are these bills under consideration this week? There's six remaining bills that would avoid a shutdown. Katy  Exactly. Exactly. So every year, the way Congress funds itself is it splits all of its budget up into 12 different bills and the bills have different agencies under each of them. They've already passed six of them, but we are waiting. The final bills include some of the biggest bills. The bill that would fund the Defense Department, the bill that would fund the Treasury Department and Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. And what are the major hurdles to getting that done?Katy  There were a lot of last minute fights related to this. One was really interesting. Whether or not lawmakers should give themselves a raise, they haven't had a raise since 2009 to their $174,000 a year salary. There was a dispute over whether a UN agency that provides money and humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees. In January, the Biden Administration paused some of the funding when it was found out that there were some folks connected to that agency involved with the October 7th attacks in Israel. There was some back and forth between lawmakers over whether that pause should be permanent, how much money should flow to this organization. At the last minute, there were some other disputes over DHS funding and how much money can go to border agents and a couple of other DHS priorities. And there was some disagreement over how much money would flow to different pots within that organization. Coming up, Goldman Sachs is losing Stephanie Cohen, one of its most senior women, and the latest in a string of women to depart the company more after the break. An exodus of top female talent continues at Goldman Sachs. We report exclusively today that Stephanie Cohen, one of the firm's most senior executives, is now exiting. People familiar with the matter say she's heading to a new role, Chief Strategy Officer at cloud services provider. Cloudflare. Cohen's departure is just the latest in what has been a string of departures of women partners. Reporter Anna Maria Andriotis has been reporting on what's happening at Goldman and she joins me now with more. Welcome back, Anna Maria. Anna  Great to be speaking with you. So Anna Maria, what I'm trying to suss out here is how much of this relates to general turmoil at Goldman versus what's specific to women's experiences in the workplace there? Why are so many women leaving?Anna  This is a complex question and the reasons are nuanced. There isn't just one. So first of all, there've been a lot of changes that have happened at Goldman in recent years. Reorgs of different divisions, reorgs on a firm-wide basis, and that has impacted both men and women, both of whom have been leaving the firm. But separately from that, it's been hard to come away from this reporting and hearing about people's experiences and looking at it, all of it in front of me without the impression and the understanding that there is an element here that is gender related. When women reach partner level and partner is pretty much one of the highest levels you can reach at Goldman, what emerges following that several years into being partner for a number of women, what has contributed to a number of them leaving has been effectively what looks like a ceiling. And that ceiling is basically women who strive to become a co-head or a head of a major division, be it global banking and markets, be it any of the other two or three major divisions that Goldman has at any given point or CFO or being a serious candidate to become the next CEO. There've been just recurring experiences and stories of women hitting a challenge there, a roadblock to getting those positions. So how many women have left the firm in recent months?Anna  Roughly 2\\u002f3 of the women who were partners at the end of 2018 have left Goldman or no longer have that of partner. The same can be set of just under half of male partners at the time. By far, the most senior executives and senior women at the firm to leave is Stephanie Cohen. In addition, a few weeks ago, another very senior executive who's been with Goldman for roughly 30 years, Beth Hammack and a long-time partner at the firm announced that she is retiring from Goldman. Both of these women have had extremely senior positions at the firm. And out of Goldman's 25 person management committee, there are two women who are on that committee who have revenue producing positions at Goldman, and that is Stephanie Cohen, Beth Hammack, the two recently announced departures from Goldman. Anna Maria, I remember your reporting on this. This was an explicit goal for CEO David Solomon to recruit and retain more women in leadership. So why isn't it working and what's the firm's plan to address it?Anna  It's difficult to answer why it isn't working. A good amount of this has to do with positions opening up high up the ranks and the higher up the ranks you get, there's just fewer seats for people and it's obviously extremely competitive. You have these one-off situations that looking back on it, on some levels, it almost seems like missed opportunities for the firm. This isn't about checking the box just to check the box and say, okay, we put a woman in this spot. And that's what has not resonated well with a number of women senior executives at Goldman, those who've left, those who are still there, as well as even some male partners who I spoke with. Nobody has solved this issue of women being more present high up the ranks at big banks. But when you look at competitors of Goldman's, you see that they've made more progress. Our longer-term success depends significantly on developing female partners in senior roles.\\\" Now, the firm talks about advancements that it's made elsewhere with regards to recruiting more women out of college, making more women vice presidents, managing directors, and also adding more women to its recent partner classes. But the issue we've been looking into reporting on is what happens after women are made partners, and that's where a lack of advancement into the firm's most senior ranks becomes evident. Thank you so much, Anna Maria. Anna  Thank you. And a call-out to you, our listeners. There's been a push for unionization in college sports most recently at Dartmouth.

Thanks for listening.\",\" Today Suspects appear in a Russian court after the deadly concert hall attack. As Islamic State's claim of responsibility raises security questions for Vladimir Putin. Cracks appear in Israel's war cabinet, and the feds potentially outsized election year roll. It's Monday, March 25. This is Royce's World News, bringing you everything you need to know from the front lines in 10 minutes, every weekday. I'm Kim Vannell in London. The Foundation of Innovation. Four suspects have been charged in the deadliest attack inside Russia in two decades. They're accused of gunning down people at a concert outside Moscow on Friday night. The 130 people were killed, including three children, and nearly 200 were injured. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack. US officials said they warned Russia of intelligence about an imminent attack earlier this month. But Russian President Vladimir Putin has not mentioned the group by name. In a televised statement, he said the attackers were trying to flee to Ukraine. Kiev has denied any involvement. Andrew Osborne is Royce's Russia Chief Political Correspondent. Andrew, what do we know about these four suspects? So we know that these people are accused of being the gunman in the attack, and three of them, the Russian authorities say, have actually confessed to the participation. They've all been charged with terrorism. They're all citizens. It would seem of Tajikistan as Central Asian country, an ex-Soviet republic. All of them appear to have been working inside Russia in recent years. One of them, for example, was a hairdresser. We don't really know because they haven't said so or been publicly shown saying so exactly what motivated them to do this, although there is one report. One of them saying that he was recruited over social media and was asked to carry out this attack for money. It was interesting when they were actually taken, when they appeared in court to be remanded in custody. It was clear that none of them were physically in a good condition. That followed a series of unconfirmed videos on social media, which showed some of them being interrogated. So for example, one of them appeared in court appearing to not have his right ear. Another was wheeled in a wheelchair. Although I should stress that is those videos of those interrogations are unverified at the moment. What's the likely fall out for President Putin? I think what this means is that Putin will now be under pressure to show more strengths, more decisiveness when it comes to stopping anything like this happening again. How big of a threat is Islamic State in Russia and across Europe? It's unclear, I think, what the precise strength is inside Russia. But what we do know is certainly in the West, people have been talking about this particular affiliate of IS, which was based in Afghanistan. And certainly Russian interests have been hit outside Russia, portally by Islamic State, notably its embassy in Kabul, in Afghanistan. France has raised its terror alert warning to the highest level following Islamic State's claim of responsibility. ISIS is still a threat here, much, much diminished. But nevertheless, our work is essentially not done. Former President Donald Trump is expected to appear in a man had in court today to seek another delay in his criminal hush money trial. His appearance comes as he faces a Monday deadline to post a bond in a civil fraud case, or risk New York State seizing his assets. To hear more about Trump and how he has transformed the Republican Party, take a listen to our weekend podcast. We'll put a link in the description of today's pot. The Nigerian army has rescued students and staff who were kidnapped by gunmen from a school earlier this month. The military said 137 hostages were freed. Earlier figures put the number abducted at over 200, and it remains unclear if some are still being held captive. Early results in Senegal's election has opposition candidate Tbasseru Diyomeh Feir ahead, sending his supporters into the streets to celebrate. Another flare-up in the South China Sea. The Philippines has summoned Beijing's envoy after accusing China's coast guard of using water cannon on a civilian boat. Tensions between the two countries over the disputed waters have escalated in recent months. Tensions of support are continuing to pour in for Britain's Princess of Wales. Kate announced on Friday she had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy. Israel's Defence Minister arrives in Washington today with a rift brewing with his boss back home. Benny Gantz, a leading member of Netanyahu's war cabinet, says he'll quit if the proposal becomes law. Dan Williams is in Jerusalem. Dan, why is this all coming to a head now? The Supreme Court gave the government until the end of this month's march to present a equitable solution for drafting the ultra-orthodox for amending scaling back or ending this exemption system. So Netanyahu, apparently, with days to go until the deadline is planning on Tuesday to submit a draft that he hopes would both modify the Supreme Court and keep his ultra-orthodox coalition partners from bolting in protest at what they would see as a threat to the exemption systems and potentially even state funding for their seminaries. How serious is this for Netanyahu? It's significant. I think it could be described as the first major crack in the war cabinet. The most senior civilian official in charge of the military, the optics on that aren't good. As for when it comes for the guns threat, it's worth looking at the phrasing he spoke about quitting the coalition if this passes in the Knesset in Parliament. That would appear to be not imminent. In fact, it probably won't happen and won't begin to happen before June, at which point the Parliament will be on the verge of a summer recess. So this is not an imminent threat, but certainly for Netanyahu, the optics aren't great about having two senior members of his coalition. One of them, his own Defence Minister from his own party, openly threatening mutiny over a matter essential to Israel's national security as the people making up its military. The Federal Reserve could potentially boost President Biden's reelection chances if it cuts rates as expected this year. That prospect has already triggered an outcry from Donald Trump and puts the central bank at the centre of the political fray. Fed correspondent Howard Schneider explains the tricky path the Fed has to weave this election year. President Biden may face the situation where the Fed pulls off a soft landing. It keeps the economy on track, keeps the unemployment rate low, wages growing, prices, pressures easing inflation falling, prices not coming down, but the rate of growth easing a lot. And then rate cuts at all. And come September, if you have that set of conditions, which the Fed said it expects, you could see credit easing, you could see lower mortgage rates, lower car loan rates, lower credit card rates, that could really be a plus for Biden in the heat of the campaign. Will that actually translate into votes for Biden? He was one of Bill Clinton's advisors who once coined the phrase, it's the economy stupid. Well, maybe it still is, and maybe it isn't. There's certainly a lot of cultural and other issues out there that could frame how people vote. On the other side of this, you've got a Republican contender, former president Donald Trump, who's got his own history with power. Remember, he made Powell Fed share. And then they quickly kind of clashed. Powell was raising interest rates at the time. And Trump hated that. He felt that Powell was trying to wreck his economy and wreck growth and almost declared him pretty much an enemy of the people at one point. It was a very kind of singular moment in Fed history when the president was openly declared sort of open warfare on the Fed share. So that's no doubt going to be noticed. And you've already seen Trump and some of his advisors argue that if the Fed does cut rates, it's only to put the fall on the scale for Biden. That's it for Monday.

Here are the questions. These icons, left to be asked. How can a story feel uniquely Latin American and universal? For over a decade we've told stories of love and migration, use in politics, the environment, food and families from everywhere Spanish is spoken. Israel's Defense Minister is in the US today at a moment of tension between the two allies. They don't agree about what should happen next in Israel's war in Gaza. The United States is pushing for a ceasefire and for Israel to allow more humanitarian aid to Palestinians who face famine. Now if it sounds repetitive, when we say that, that's because it is. The United States has been asking for the same things for weeks now. Israel says it is not done dismantling the Milton Group Hamas. And PR's Jennifer Lutton joins us now from Tel Aviv with the latest. Good morning, Jennifer. Hello. Hi. So what should we expect from the Israeli Defense Minister's visit here in DC? So a big focus is going to be the southern Gaza town of Rafa. You have more than a million displaced Palestinians crowded in there. The US says invading would be a huge mistake. And it specifically invited Israelis to Washington to talk about alternative options. But Israel says it cannot defeat Hamas without going into Rafa and it's going to attack whether the US approves or not. Also before boarding his flight, Israeli Defense Minister Yav Galant said he's going to bring up US military aid and helping Israel keep its quote, qualitative edge. This has become controversial. You now have some Democrats arguing that Israel's actions in Gaza may disqualify it from US military aid. Yeah. I mean, Senator Chris Coons, who's close to President Biden, was on the program last week and he said it would be, quote, almost impossible to attack Rafa in a way that was acceptable to the US. So the delegation will discuss that. But what's happening away from Rafa in other parts of Gaza? So for a week now, Israel says it has been battling hundreds of militants who have regrouped at the main hospital in Northern Gaza, outshifa. Again, Israel says Hamas is embedding itself in a civilian population there. I mean, it's also graded to other hospitals over the weekend. It claims there were weapons stockpiles. This has left thousands of patients, doctors, civilians, sheltering in these hospitals caught in this fighting. Gaza's health ministry says some have died from fire, smoke, or shelling. And it's just adding to an incredibly dire humanitarian crisis. Amber Alyan is an American physician with doctors without borders. She and others say there's no longer supplies to treat the many wounded. Here's what she told our colleague, Michelle Kellerman. The patients who have survived thus far are increasingly getting sicker. They're getting more infections. Their wounds are getting infected. They're literally rotting. The fact that they don't have access to food for the patients makes it even harder for their wounds to heal. I mean, what she describes on top of the widespread hunger, we're seeing images of people eating grass to stave off that hunger. And so many international groups and governments are pushing Israel to allow more humanitarian aid, especially food in Gaza. Any progress there? You know, mostly we've seen a lot of frustration and trading blame. Over the weekend, the Secretary General of the United Nations actually went to the border with Gaza to highlight this crisis. Antonio Guterres accused Israel of holding up aid trucks. He said Palestinians are stuck in a non-stop nightmare and that the extreme hunger is just shocking. Now, on Sunday, Israel did say 103 aid trucks had entered Gaza. But keep in mind, before this whole crisis, there were 500 aid trucks a day going in. And so it's a massive drop when it's needed most. And the latest you and Nebris show it keeps going down. Less food aid got in in February than did in January. Now, what's happening with any possible deal in these discussions that we're going on in Kutsa? Do we know where they stand? Just in brief, you know, the focus is freeing up. Some of the 130 Israeli-Hasaj is still in Gaza, but a hang up is whether Hamas can get a permanent ceasefire. Israel, of course, says it can't do that. It's still intense to battle Hamas in Rafa. And Pairs, Jennifer Lutten, in Tel Aviv. Thank you, Jennifer. Thank you. For suspected shooters in Friday's attack on a Russian concert hall in Moscow have been charged with terrorism. The death toll from this attack has been going up all through the weekend. An authorities say it killed nearly 140 people injuring many more. A part of the Islamic State, known as ISIS-K, claimed responsibility. Russian authorities have ignored that, instead, suggesting the involvement of Ukraine. Morning. So, Charles, you were out at the site of the tragedy last night. Tell me what you saw. Yeah, you know, this was the second time I was out there over the weekend. There was a small memorial I saw on Saturday, and it had grown into this massive display of flowers and tributes by Sunday, with even Orthodox priests on hand to give a church liturgy. And among Russians, I met who came to pay the respects. It was a university student named Nicholas, who declined to give his last name and saying he was still in shock over events. I came to express condolences to those who lost loved ones and family on the attack he tells me, adding he wouldn't wish this tragedy on anyone. And so you were at this site, but this must have shaken people across Russia well beyond the capital and this concert hall, right? Yeah, you know, we've seen people donating blood across the country, impromptu memorials to the victims in other towns and cities. But it also seems like the government is intent on channeling this grief. Over the weekend, an image of a candle in the phrase, we mourn, popped up on billboards across the country, pro-cremlin pop stars, who recorded tributes and solidarity. And even back at the scene last night, at the concert hall, clearly this was an organized event. You know, pro-cremlin youth groups were marching in line to bring flowers. There was a sound system, even a projected light show on the side of the concert hall building that showed whitebirds flying skyward to honor the victims. And all this was filmed by camera drones from above. And so all of this has been circulating on social media and, of course, date TV. Meanwhile, four suspects have now been charged in court with acts of terrorism. What's happening there? Yeah, that's right. These are the alleged shooters detained on Saturday, all citizens of the former Soviet Republic of Tajikistan. In court, all four pleaded guilty, but it must be said, all showed signs of torture and duress. One of the accused was brought in a wheelchair, not even conscious. Another showed up with a bandage on his ear after his interrogator cut off a portion of it with a knife. We know because the authorities released a video. Meanwhile, others had swollen faces with bruises and cuts. So taking all of that into account, there certainly will be those who questioned the confessions they gave. So with questions around this trial, what do we expect going forward? Well, the trial is likely to start in late May. These men faced life in prison if convicted. Russia currently does not have the death penalty, although that's increasingly a matter of debate here. Meanwhile, there's the larger question of who ordered the attack. The crisis claimed responsibility, and the U.S. has come to that conclusion as well. But President Vladimir Putin is only comments on the attack so far insisted these attackers were trying to escape to Ukraine. And even though Kiev denies any involvement vehemently, we're all bracing to see what happens next, not only in the courtroom or the court of public opinion, but most of all on the battlefields of Ukraine. And P.R.'s Charles Mainz in Moscow, thank you, Charles. Thank you. 2 of Donald Trump's legal battles collide today. One criminal, one civil, both in New York City. Okay, a judge holds a hearing in the criminal hush money case, which involves Trump's longtime fixer, Michael Cohen, and adult film star, Starmie Daniels. That hearing could lead to a start date for the trial. Today is also the deadline for Trump to pay almost half a billion dollars in his civil fraud trial. If he does not do that, the New York Attorney General could start the process of seizing his properties. And P.R.'s Andrea Bernstein joins us now to sort out everything Trump faces today. Good morning, Andrea. Good morning. So let's start with the criminal case. What is Donald Trump facing here? So this was the first case to be indicted of the four. And it's back to the 2016 campaign in late October of that year, Michael Cohen, who was then the personal attorney for Donald Trump, got wind that Starmie Daniels was planning to go public with news and alleged affair with Donald Trump. This was pretty soon after the excess Hollywood tape was released, where Trump talked about grabbing women by the genitals because one year a star, they let you do it. Cohen has said he didn't think the campaign could withstand another blow of this kind. So he set up a limited liability corporation to pay Daniels to keep quiet. And then Donald Trump allegedly agreed to a scheme to pay Cohen back by calling the reimbursements a legal retainer, which they were not. That's a felony. If the DA can prove that Trump falsified the records to cover up another crime, that is the crime of making an illegal payment to benefit his campaign, in this case, the hush money payments. And this trial was supposed to start today, but it's already been pushed back. Remind us what happened. Yes, so there was a hearing last month where judge one, Mershon, was firm that he wanted to start today. But then DA Alvin Bragg made public that there had been a last minute production of over 100,000 documents from the federal prosecutors who had prosecuted Michael Cohen. Trump is calling this malfeasance, but Bragg says there's not much new here. Mershon is expected to let us know today if he'll keep his current trial date, April 15th. If that is the case, Trump will be in court most days for the following two months, tried on 34 felony counts, which could bring jail time. So there's a lot to keep straight here. Trump also faces the deadline to post a bond for the penalty in his civil fraud case, too, for engaging in fraudulent business practices, right? It's kind of mind-boggling that both of these things are happening today, but it's a coincidence. Has Trump been able to come up with the money? So Trump has appealed the judgment in the civil fraud case, but he still has to put the money aside. Last week he argued to an appeals court that to cover the bond, to get a bond was a practical immossibility, because he doesn't have the cash to guarantee it right now. They're trying to pull my father out of business. They're trying to take all his resources that you'd otherwise put into his own campaign for presidency. Part of the reason, Donald Trump. He's having trouble getting a bond is because he already had to come up with a hundred million dollars in liquid assets to cover his judgment in a separate civil case. The EG and Carol defamation suit, he's appealed that one, too. The appeals court in the fraud case hasn't acted yet, and if it does nothing, there is nothing to prevent. The Attorney General, Leticia James, from starting to seize Trump's properties this week, which she said she'll do. And here's Andrea Bernstein. Good luck covering all this today. Thank you so much.

It was two years ago today. Benjamin Hall was nearly killed in an attack while reporting on the war in Ukraine. One of the important parts of my recovery has been the message that journalism can never be silenced. You can attack us. You can try and stop us, but we won't stop. The words won't stop. I'm Jessica Rosenthal. Does the UK's new gender care policy for minors signal a growing shift in how we medically treat trans children? And will US medical agencies reconsider their policies? I think we're underutilizing therapy in this and overutilizing political ideology. And I'm Tammy Bruce. The US has found a way to give Ukraine more military aid to fend off Russia's invasion. How? President Biden says... Using cost savings from previously approved Pentagon contracts. The package includes munitions and rounds to help Ukraine hold the line against Russia's brutal attacks. Which sounds good, but it's a band-aid on a deeper wound. We need to fix this deeper wound. We are struggling with lack of ammunition, with struggling, with lack of support, even though we're getting some, but how much is enough? Klitschko is lobbying Congress for a lot more help in that battle against Russia, urging lawmakers to approve $60 billion worth of more military aid that's stalled in the house. Every year, on the day itself, March 14th, brings back a whole lot of different emotions. First of all, I remember Pierre and Sasha who died that day, that is at the top of the list, a cameraman, a producer out there, very close to me. You were all in the same vehicle. And that's got to be the number one priority about that day, is remembering those who can't come back. The other side is, I suppose, an immense sense of pride. We've come through it so well that I've come through it so well, and to be sitting here opposite you is a remarkable thing, and I put that down to community, to the people who help me get through it, to having goals. I'm honored to be sitting across from you. You've gone through so much to get back to here, to where you are. That day, I want you to talk a little bit about that moment, and how quickly, after you've been attacked, you're badly wounded, you thought I'm going to be sitting here doing this again. Very, very quickly. In fact, even while I was lying there, I took pictures of my leg that are blown off, and I was there for about 40 minutes, and I was kind of in an out of consciousness, but it's what we do. We're journalists, and I think it's a safe place for me to go. I just look around, figure out what's going on. I was already in a sense covering and reporting what was happening at the time, and then within a couple days when I was finally evacuated, again, I was writing things down, I was taking voice notes. It isn't a sense quite peaceful for me to do that. I enjoy doing it. It keeps my mind focused, and that was important to do. I knew from the beginning that I was going to come back to journalists, and that I wanted to tell not only with a story about what happened to me, but go back to telling stories around the world and the news. I also think I was back in Ukraine in November, and one of the important parts of my recovery has been the message that journalism can never be silenced. You can attack us. You can try and stop us, but we won't stop. The words won't stop. I always wanted to do it. There were times I didn't think I could. I imagine that. The recovery was very hard. How many surgeries have you had? Around 35 now, and I've got a couple more coming up soon as well. They don't stop. You know, you filter it in around operations. If I have a time I can work, I work. And then if I have to take a bit of time off, I take time off. But that's just the schedule of my life at the moment, and that's fine. Tell us about peer and Sasha. We lost them. And you say that you don't want to forget them. Tell us about what they were like. Pierre loved journalism more than anything. He loved people. He loved traveling. He loved showing people what was going on around the world. We worked together since 2015, and we had covered countless conflicts together. We had slept in the trenches together. We'd been in caves together. We fought alongside troops against everyone from ISIS to the Taliban. And everywhere we went, Pierre taught me things. He taught me how to really speak to people, how to get the true stories out of people. OK. He taught me. He really helped me develop as a journalist. And I know that he would want us to continue reporting. He wouldn't want us being sad and wallowing. He would want us out. He would want us to keep doing this. So he's someone who brought life to everyone. Wherever you went, he would go up to the first checkpoint, and he would be talking to soldiers, and they would be laughing in a minute. He sounds like a very brave guy. He would open doors. He was like my guy, he'd hook up his satellites with not exaggerating. He'd find a wire or piece of a car and he'd hook it together, and he'd get his life anywhere. Amazing. And Sasha, she was from... She was in Ukraine. Sasha was Ukrainian. She was our local producer, and she was our fixer at the time, and she made a lot of things happen. And she was doing it because she wanted to help her country, however she could. So it was tragic what happened that day. And we just have to think about them, and hopefully everything we do, we can do in their names and make sure their memories are never forgotten. So now, as the war continues, and you said you'd been back to Ukraine, and I know you sat down with President Zelensky, he's at a tough spot right now. American military aid remains stalled. Now, the U.S. is sending $300 million more in weapons and ammo that they found through cost savings, I guess, depending on a role. But President Biden says that's only a few more weeks. Russia has now a spring and summer. Is there a lot of worry that they're going to make big gains from here forward? Big worry, and Ukraine, big worry. They are having to ration the artillery shells they have. And when they are being attacked along some of those front lines, sometimes they can't really hold Russia back in some places, because they do not have the weapons they need. You know, you are seeing a struggle sometimes for Ukrainians to get enough soldiers as well, so they're struggling on that front as well. Across the board, Ukraine is struggling to hold on to the lines it has, and Russia knows it, and they are pushing now in a way they haven't before. They understand that Western support is dripping away from the U.S. They counted on this, didn't they? They counted on it 100%. Yes. So right now, it's a difficult time for Ukraine, and everyone's looking ahead to November to see what happens in the elections here. His forces have been removed. They had to leave some of the areas and the east in this war. The counteroffensive that Ukraine attempted, has that been a complete failure? Yes, it has. They just didn't quite anticipate the level to which the Russians had built their defenses. The amount of mines they laid, three different levels along the way. And eventually, the U.S. did give cluster bombs. You know, they didn't want to, but they did to clear the minefields, but that came quite late. So no, they were not able to move at all, and it was a real hope, and I think that might be whether Western support, U.S. support started to shift. There's talk of sitting down at the table. Russian President Putin referenced that. The other day, Pope Francis controversially said that maybe it's time for Ukraine to show the courage to end the war. But if that happens, Ukraine has to acknowledge the losses and give up its territory. It's really interesting. You know, Russia invaded in 2014, and they came to the Minsk agreement whereby there was a cease-fire of sorts. But all Russia does is it rebuild its armies, and then it attacks again. I understand the Ukrainian position saying, yeah, even if we did negotiate, we know full well that Russia will rebuild its army, and then they attack us one more time. So what is the benefit of negotiating now? At the same time, there's very little likelihood that Russia will be pushed out at all. So it's a very difficult scenario. Even inside domestically, inside Ukraine, there are growing calls for negotiation to happen. But Zelensky, 100% single-handedly, says we will not do that. What about NATO? It's expanded now, Sweden and Finland. There have been these talks, Russia claims, that there have been some NATO countries that have actually put some of their soldiers in. The French leader suggested that maybe some NATO allies will have to put troops in. Is that ever going to happen? You're president Macron has been quite interesting in France. He's really become more belly-coast, aggressive character, and I think it's partly for a European perspective. I don't think there's any... Is he serious? No, I don't think there's any chance that's actually going to happen, to be honest. NATO is an interesting one at the moment. Putin just said he was moving more troops to the Finnish border. He's been flying more planes over Sweden, bombers over Sweden recently. So there's attention there. And I suppose it all lays into the long-term question. Is Putin's idea just to capture more of Ukraine, or does he have ideas to move into Europe and NATO and attack some of these other states? And that's the big unknown. But many people are saying we should prepare in case he does. We can't just talk about it. We should prepare for the moment he may do that. He's threatened again that he's ready to find a nuclear war. If it comes to that, is that just something he knows when he waves that? It frightens people? No, I don't think so. You think he's serious? I think he's serious. Not with... And you've got to split the two kinds of nuclear weapons. It's not like a Hiroshima style bomb. You can use a tactical nuclear weapon, which is smaller. A smaller one, which is devastating, but comes close to some of the large, normal bombs that are used. And so I could see a place where, if it was really on the back foot, if things weren't going well, perhaps you could use a small tactical nuclear. It's a clear sign with that actually going into the large scale. A nuke. Now a lot would have to happen for him to do that. But I do think that Putin is a rat in a corner. And if you really corner him at some point, you don't know. So I don't think it should be dismissed. I want to bring up your book again. Saved a war reporter's mission to make it home. It's in paper back now. For someone who reads it, what will they learn? What's your message to people who read the book? Well, more than anything, it's about... You know, you can get knocked down, be knocked down, but you can find a way to stand up. And the way to do that is through community, being close to people. You know, so many people came to help me. They evacuated me, military medicine, peace me together. And I just felt like such a large part of a community. Sometimes I worry we are forgetting. It must be the backbone of our society is coming together to get through difficult things. We can get through anything. Set yourself goals, and that's how you do it. And I talk about how I got through the hardest parts, the really painful parts, the difficult moments. And it's led to your podcast, searching for heroes with Benjamin Hall. What's the next episode? This week I'm speaking to Jen Griffin, who organized my evacuation from Ukraine. She got together. That's right, she did. Incredible group of people. That was not easy to do. No, save our lives. The US military is not even there. Exactly. So these guys came in of veterans, among them, the Medal of Honor winner, a bronze stars winner. These are a lot of the guys who are formerly in the US military, Green Berets, intelligence, who were out there saving people. They were saving Americans. And so I speak to Jen Griffin in this episode. She talks not only about that, but also about her own career, current conflicts and the military and community, and how you get through difficult times yourself. And all my guests in the podcast have gone through something really difficult. And they've all come out the other side. They've all found different ways to do so. So it's a reminder to people, the podcasts, that you can go through difficult things, but you can always get through them. And that heroes, you know, some of the people I speak to, they don't come from. They're not famous, you don't know them. Remind you that heroes are everywhere. They really are. They're in every community you go to. Well, I think some people would consider you a hero for what you've been able to accomplish and the message that you continue to say. And we are really delighted. And I'm honored to be here with you, Benjamin. Benjamin, great to talk to you. I would have pleasure to. Thanks for having me on. Thank you.

This after a review by a doctor in 2022, found gaps in the evidence around the drugs. Dr. Hillary Cass said at the time they should reconsider how they treat gender dysphoria in minors. Now NHS says teens with gender dysphoria will be referred to psychologists and social workers over the course of several months. This is huge because we're seeing as all these syruping countries that pioneer this, they're reversing course and stopping these treatments in children. Of course right now the US is far behind, but they are going to follow. Chloe Cole of Missouri underwent a transition from female to male, including having a mastectomy at 15 years old. She has since detransitioned. And the blockers ultimately were the gateway drug to the rest of my treatment. As the policy shift occurs, NHS notes just 100 young people are receiving puberty blockers from them in the UK. However, the gender identity service there saw an increase in referrals from about 250 a year to over 5,000 between 2021 and 2022. In the United States in 2022, the UCLA Williams Institute noted 1.6 million Americans now identifies transgender. 300,000 of whom are between 13 and 17 years of age. Today, 23 states have policies restricting transgender-related care for minors. During debate in Missouri about a ban on puberty blockers and hormones earlier this year, 17-year-old Andrew Rodriguez-Domsgard told state lawmakers, Please channel your energy and your power and your concern into different more pressing matters other than what I do with my body to make me happy. As more young people have declared they are trans, major medical bodies have expressed support for gender-affirming care, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Endocrine Society, and the American Medical Association. In 2022, the same year the NHS was advised to reconsider its policy, the National Healthcare Body in Sweden, determined the risks of puberty-inhibiting treatment for those under 18 outweigh the possible benefits. I think this fits on top of what's already been happening. In Western Europe and in the UK, I think the UK has been taking a very careful look at this. And what's tragic here is that with all of the information that came out previous, even prior to the pandemic, about the impact of long-term impact of puberty blockers, I think it's been purely political in the United States. 22 states have banned it, but the rest of the country hasn't. And I think that what they're doing in the UK is taking a much more careful look at things. If you think about the National Health Service, which I'm not entirely a great fan of, because they rash and care, but they don't want to rash and care to something that's going to cause more problems than it solves. And that's the problem with puberty blockers. Is there something called gender dysphoria? Yes, definitely. Is that overly politicized? Yes. Do people outgrow it? Yes. Do you want to give somebody a puberty blocker, which blocks the production of testosterone or estrogen right at the time when it usually explodes and then puts you down a pathway where you later regret having made those choices? No, you don't want to do that. And puberty blockers also cause headaches. They cause confusion. They can cause depression and anxiety. They're bad for your bones and they can cause fertility problems later on, especially when they're put together with testosterone or estrogen. I think those are things that you could consider when you're an adult. But what's the scenario where a child or a teen makes that decision in conjunction with who? An overbearing parent? Or no parent at all, but the state? It's not a, it's a very problematic situation for a young person and did they get proper mental health support? Before, that's the yellow elephant in the room. It looks like the American Academy of Pediatrics voted again last August to confirm their 2018 support for gender, affirming care for minors, which means puberty blockers and hormones. But they said at the same time they are reviewing medical research on treatments. What should they be considering and what are they considering, do you think? And maybe are they signaling that they're open to a shift? I certainly hope so. They're basing their earlier decisions on the idea that a couple of studies have shown that gender reassignment treatments, that's kind of a, that's a term for many things, right? That also includes surgery, mastectomies, which are not easily reversible. I mean, castrration, that's, these are very problematic things. And that's put together with puberty blockers. And I think they're looking at a few studies that show maybe long term or moderate term, not long term, moderate term, that there's an improvement in anxiety or depression. But we have just as many studies showing the opposite, that these treatments cause an increase in anxiety and depression. Lupron, which is the main puberty blocker we use is a treatment for prostate cancer. It causes a lot of discomfort in people that take it. But if you have prostate cancer, you may have no choice. Here you have a choice. And the choice is to wait. And I don't think that they're basing it on convincing evidence. I think the UK is much more on the side of what the prevailing evidence is, which is there's a lot of side effects of these drugs. You know, that that may disturb the transition of a teen period as they grow older. And then we don't know all the long term problems with taking them. We don't know all of them. But I think bone loss and bone density is enough and fertility concerns. Yeah, it is a part of this that interest in transgender affirming care by minors has skyrocketed as of late. And so there is somewhat limited amount of information about the effects of transition care on a growing body. Well, but you know, you bring up a point that from a physician, I look at a little differently. Why? Why does the number of people requesting this go from 250 to 5000 in the UK? Why? Is it biologic? How could it be biologic? I mean, it can't be biologic. It's got to be sociologic. So what's the society doing to promote these choices of people not accepting the gender assignment that God gave them essentially? Again, I don't want people to be uncomfortable. I don't want people to be severely depressed or suicidal. I believe gender this for you exists. But I think it's been overlaid with a tremendous amount of political posturing, which is extremely dangerous and detrimental. Let's stop for a second and remind people. England's national health system says what they're banning for kids. And you've already referenced this is something that it stops puberty. And in the policy they write puberty blockers will not be available to children with gender dysphoria. There is not enough evidence of safety and clinical effectiveness. If there isn't enough evidence now, then what's been going on this whole time? Is that essentially an admission that we dove into something without evidence and you know evidence of safety and clinical effectiveness? Well, that's what that's what happens a lot isn't it that that decisions are made without the proper evidence to back them up. And I think politics plays too large a role in terms of medical decisions. I think there's a preponderance of evidence to the contrary that was there that was overlooked that these drugs of side effects. I just said we've been using them for prostate cancer. It's not some new kid on the block that we don't know about. These drugs have been around a long time and we know they have serious side effects. And we're giving them to people that are in very impressionable years. And you know, I mean, I'm usually for certain treatments for children and teens like vaccines, for example, but this is a totally different thing. Adolescents are informative stages. They're changing their minds about things all the time. I think to push them down or allow them to go down in an irretrutable course where an intervention is put in place that has serious side effects is a mistake. Now in the UK, they're not actually banning it. They're saying they're not going to condone it or allow it or authorize it or enable it. That's a statement I believe that's consistent with medicine and public health. Of course, parents or children can go and get it somewhere else. Yeah, privately. privately. Yeah. But that's I think we're getting a statement with a government here being in line with what the science shows. And just to clarify, this policy says from the age of 16, teenagers who've been on hormone blockers for at least 12 months, maybe given cross-sex hormones known as gender-affirming hormones. It sounds like they're saying the clock will start at 16 in the UK, at least from from NHS standpoint. Right. That's exactly right. Right. We could just say a Jessica. But I think that the issue here is what about a 12 or a 13 year old? I mean, if you're asking me if I think a 15 or a 16 year old, that's more that's not really the way I would practice. But you know, that's at least moving the ball to an older age. I mean, we're talking about 12 year olds and 13 year olds in the United States getting mastectomy is completely ridiculous in my opinion that should not be allowed. Okay. Briefly back to your earlier point about mental health, you know, proponents of gender-affirming care for minors consistently point to studies that they say show higher depression rates, higher rates of suicidal thoughts for those who are transgender. But once they start the puberty blockers or the hormones, those rates of depression and suicidal thoughts decrease significantly if these studies are correct, if they are correct, what is the policy answer then? If you when you look at those numbers? Well, I know about those studies and I think they're legitimate, but the question is why? Why is depression decreasing? Because of the political overlay, because of a placebo effect, because you feel now that your behavior is self-justifying. I also told you that the puberty blockers themselves have been shown to increase anxiety and depression on their own, just medical side effects of the drugs. So this is something that physicians take into account when they do something called the risk-benefit analysis. But a risk-benefit analysis for an adult is different than one for a child or for a teen. And so I'm concerned about the prematurity here of this. They haven't done a study that would be, what if I wait till 18? That'd be an interesting study, right? What would be the rate of, you don't want anyone committing suicide under any circumstances, believe me. But if you have a teen that's depressed at 13, does that mean you have to put them down this path or do you try to get them to 18 and then make a decision? How do you, Dr. How do you get them to 18? You get them before a therapist, you get them before somebody who can talk this out with them? Absolutely. I think we're underutilizing therapy in this and overutilizing political ideology. Am I missing anything in this debate? Is there anything you want to add about this? Do you, do you have you talked to people as a doctor? I mean, you see patients. Have you talked to people about this in your, in your office? This is a deeply troubling topic. I think it should be handled medically and not politically. One more thing I didn't emphasize is how about the study that answers this question? Does the use of puberty blockers lead to premature surgeries and the gender reassignment surgeries? The answer is they're connected. That's also disturbing. I think that our societies, and we saw this in the pandemic, are standing on the podium a little bit too much. I think when you look to Western Europe and the UK now, I think our societies might be advised to say, you know, we're taking that seriously. Maybe we need to take a step back here. Maybe we're advising something and we're not in the room with the patient and the doctor and the parent, if there is a parent, you know, maybe we're being a little too intrusive. I don't like medicine by policy. I don't like medicine by guidelines. I like medicine to be something decentralized between a physician, a parent, and a child, and everything gets taken into account. Dr. Marceebel, thanks so much for joining. Thank you for having me. . Late the American who coined the popular term March madness. Henry Van R's Dale Porter was born in Manino, Illinois on October 2nd, 1891, just two months before the advent of basketball. Porter spent his life working in high school athletics and being an advocate for the All-American sport born beside him. Porter crafted the first high school rulebook back in 1936, which was later adapted by the National Basketball Rules Committee. He also helped sports manufacturers develop the first leather basketball, replacing the hard-to-drift-laced balls, which high schools across the country soon adopted. In 1939, he wrote his famous and influential essay, Headlined March Madness, where he detailed the allure of basketball and how it brought joy to Americans during the great depression. He wrote, quote, Eagles flying heroes die beneath some foreign arch, let their sons thread where hate is dead in a happy madness of March. March madness became the new slogan across America, especially in Porter's small town in Illinois, where high school basketball was all the rave. The term was used to advertise high school basketball tournaments in Chicago during the 1960s and gained national coverage when it was uttered during the NCAA tournament by sports broadcaster Brent Musburger. The March madness creator passed away on October 27th, 1975 at the age of 84. Porter was inducted into the nice moth memorial hall of fame as the lone member of the 1960s class for his contributions to basketball's lasting legacy. Follow up a chair and join me, Rachel Campbell's, Duffy and me former US congressman Sean Duffy as we share our perspective on the discussions happening at kitchen tables across America. When New York Governor Kathy Hocal announced that she would be deploying a thousand members of the National Guard and State Police to perform bad checks throughout the New York City subway system, people were perplexed. The theory goes if the Democrats really wanted to make people safer, they would arrest people who commit crimes and put them in jail and not for five minutes. What a concept. But no, the Democrats aren't serious about stopping crime, but they are experts at gaslighting and distractions. Immediately critics saw this for what it is. Security theater during an election year. Hocal herself confirmed this during an interview on MSNBC saying, I'm going to demonstrate that Democrats fight crime as well. This narrative that Republicans have said and hijacked the story that were soft on crime that we defund the police. No. Talk about the compulsion to confess. There she is on national television. Crying about how this is a partisan demonstration to restore belief in a false Democrat narrative that everything is just fine. And they haven't decimated police departments in blue cities, especially New York. But if that's the case, why is she deploying armed troops into the subway? The situation itself is absurd. A state playacting that they're tough on crime by sending the National Guard into the transportation system with no real power to do anything at all. People can decline to have their bad search. And if so, Hocal says that they can't ride the subway. Really? And exactly how will that be enforced? Does she mean for the presence of the National Guard to simply be a deterrent? Possibly. But that's a dangerous game for a city where a mob of illegal aliens felt free to attack New York City police officers in Times Square. There are more rational things the state and city could do like have the transit cups actually ride on the trains, ticket and arrest bad people who do bad things, or end the no bail rules that allow an air go encourage criminals to keep on victimizing people and society itself. But adding more transit cops would cost money. Money needed for a super important new NYPD team with which the city cannot live without. The new New York police department dance squad. With priorities like this, people can stop wondering why everything is in such disarray. It's funny what an election year does to the left when poll numbers offer up the stark reality that Americans are sick and tired of the left's putrid scheme to pitice against each other while drowning us in a sea of chronic fear. There is something quite ghoulish about having facilitated a collapse of law and order through direct policy decisions, kneecapping law enforcement, while essentially ending criminal incarceration and punishment only to declare that you are going to save the city and save the day by sending in the military as window dressing. While it seems like a general schizophrenic episode displayed by politicians in the media, the fact is there is a method to this madness. It reveals the fact that they understand what they've done. They know it has made our lives worse, that Americans don't like it, and they need to pretend that they're doing something about it. But it also provides a glimpse into the decayed mentality that remains committed to a public policy of creating and maintaining fear and social chaos simply for the sake of it. And for the power they imagine it will guarantee them. Normally, November is just a lovely fall month. But for our country, we now recognize November 2024 provides a unique opportunity for the decent to say enough is enough. AMAC.US.\",\" Russian authorities say several people believe responsible for an attack on a concert hall are in custody. Gunman killed more than 100 people on the outskirts of Moscow and left the venue on fire. I'm Aisha Roscoe. In the US, a government shutdown averted for now. The House Speaker worked with Democrats to pass spending bills. And now there's another revolt from inside his conference. I filed a motion to vacate today, but it's more of a warning and a pink slip. And a message from the Princess of Wales, she has cancer. This of course came as a huge shock. And William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately at the sake of our young family. Stay with us. We have the news you need to start your weekend.

Can I just say thank you to you for such a thoughtful interview? Oh my god, yeah, thank you now. Bullseye. Interviews with creators you love and creators you need to know. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack on the cons of venue just outside of Moscow. And our Russian authorities claim the men arrested for the attack were arrested on their way to the Ukrainian border. And Pierce Charles Mainz went to the scene of the attack which has been condemned by leaders around the world. Charles, thank you for being with us. You're going to be with you. What did you see in here? Yeah, so this morning I took the metro out to Crocus City Hall. This is the concert venue where this terrible attack took place. And so as you can hear there, there's a heavy security presence of helicopters and police. And Russians were bringing flowers to an impromptu memorial set off to the side of this massive entertainment complex. Among the Russians there, a gentleman unnamed Anna Toley who declined to provide his last name, given we were surrounded by security agents, but it turns out he used to work at the Crocus venue. It's not that... No, no, no. No. So here on Toley says he knew a lot of the people working at the event last night and felt obligated to pay his respects. He said that some might be injured, others were of course dead. And he called this all a big tragedy, which of course it is. Charles, can you take us through what we know about what happened? Well, the attackers who appear to number up to four, perhaps five, and number based on some of the videos we've seen. They entered the venue armed with collation of codes and explosives. Shortly before a sold out concert by a veteran Soviet era rock band called Picnic, they were scheduled to start their show. Witness video shows the gunman firing point blank on civilians, on security guards near the entrance, before heading to the main concert hall. A fire then broke out after the attackers detonated explosives and golfing the venue in smoke and flames that quickly spread, sending the public scurrying. Some people hidden bathrooms and basements, others were rescued from the roof or broke through glass to make their way out. And of course, many never did. The whole complex caught fire. And today I could see the facade of the building. It's just now gutted. Moreover, amid the chaos, the attackers got away. Russian authorities say they've caught the attackers in accomplices. What's known about them? Well, Russia's investigative committee said it arrested eleven individuals in connection with the attack today, for apparently for direct involvement, leaked data of their passports, at least online, claims that several of these men are from Central Asia, in fact, from the former Soviet Republic of Tajikistan. And yet, they were detained on their way to the Ukrainian border, where Russian security services suggest these men had, quote, contacts. Now as you noted in the intro, an Islamic state group has claimed responsibility in a statement for this attack. And let's not forget the US embassy had publicly warned. It had credible reports that extremists were preparing an attack at a public event like a concert in Moscow, a charge that Russian president Vladimir Putin's later said was fearmongering. And indeed, the intelligence was off. The US warning came out two weeks ago, said it would happen within the next 48 hours. But as one gentleman today, who spoke with me off the record, said, how is it the US new in our own security forces didn't? I'm Pierce Charles Mange and Moscow, thanks so much. Thank you. A familiar drama is playing out on Capitol Hill. A house speaker works with Democrats to pass spending bills to keep the government open. And then his job is threatened. I do believe we've seen this before. Last time it was Kevin McCarthy. This time it's Mike Johnson. And for our political correspondent Susan Davis joins us now. Susan, thanks so much for being with us. Happy to be here, Scott. Only after the house passed a package of six spending bills on Friday. George Republican Marjorie Taylor, Green introduced a resolution to remove Mike Johnson from leadership. This is not personal against Mike Johnson. He's a very good man. And I have respect for him as a person, but he is not doing the job. Is this the end for the speaker? You know, it could be the vast majority of House Republicans still support Speaker Johnson. It's roughly this same small group of hard-right conservatives who continue to be angry that a Republican speaker cannot deliver clear conservative wins in a divided government. But they've always sort of wanted an impossible outcome. And Johnson understood this. There's only so much you can do when Democrats control the Senate and the White House. And he chose stability in the government versus shutting it down with no end game out of it. But House Republicans have been infighting since the outsting of former Speaker McCarthy. It's been a really unruly majority. There's a lot of bad blood. And remember, the current House rules still make it easy for just a handful of lawmakers to remove the Speaker. Johnson has a short reprieve. The House is going to be adjourned for two weeks until after Easter. But this is something that they could confront in April. Sue Woodrow might Democrats play because they voted unanimously against Kevin McCarthy. But to Speaker Johnson engender any more sympathy. He does. Yes. He's the minority leader of the Democrat from New York. He has publicly said that if the motion of a Kate were to happen again, some Democrats might vote to save him and keep him as Speaker. As Jeffries has reasoned it, they can trust Johnson where they couldn't trust McCarthy. He has kept his word through these budget negotiations. He did rely on Democratic votes and negotiated in good faith to pass them. And there is still one must pass item before the election, at least for the White House and for Democrats, which is that money for Ukraine. And once again, that means Democrats could have some leverage over the Speaker and over the Republican majority. But that again is still a pretty difficult position for a Speaker to be in. And Ukraine aid is an issue that splits the Republican party. But what kind of path might there be to make it through the House? You know, Johnson has publicly committed to approving or at least bringing up for a vote, some form of foreign aid. It's not necessarily going to be that full $95 billion package that the Senate approved. Some Republicans are talking about making it alone or putting other terms on the money. But it seems pretty clear that there is a bipartisan majority of votes to pass aid to Ukraine in the House. There has been enormous pressure on Speaker Johnson from the National Security Community, from the White House, and from the other top three congressional leaders saying, we have to do this. But Donald Trump opposes it. And there is deep opposition to this money among Republican base voters. So far, Donald Trump continues to back Johnson for Speaker. But could that change? Back away on lawmakers here, and it adds to the precarious nature of his hold on the job, and how long he can hold on to it, and whether he can hold on to it through the election. And to what's the status of the impeachment investigation of President Biden? It seems like it's on ice. One of the leading investigators oversight chairman James Comer, he's a Republican from Kentucky. He said this week that the path forward might shift to possible criminal referrals to the Justice Department. That of course does not mean that the Justice Department will investigate. It just means they could. It seems pretty clear Republicans don't have the votes to impeach Joe Biden on the House floor. Democrats are obviously not going to help them on that one, Scott. But this is a tough vote that just got tougher. Ken Buck of Colorado is a House Republican who left the House early on Friday. He retired early. That same day, Mike Gallagher, he's a Republican from Wisconsin, announced he'd already said he was going to retire, but he announced he's going to leave in a couple weeks. Gallagher was one of just three Republicans who voted against the impeachment of Homeland Secretary, Mayorkas. He condemned his party for using impeachments for purely political purposes. But also what that means, Scott, is when Mike Gallagher leaves, Speaker Johnson is going to have a one vote margin in his majority to pass legislation or any other matter through the House. And for your political correspondence, Susan Davis, thanks so much. You're welcome. The reaction to a video of the Princess of Wales was first shocked, followed by concern. And then for some shame. Kate had been the target of rumor and speculation for two months about her health, her whereabouts, about a Photoshopped picture, and about her marriage. It turns out that all the while she was dealing with something very serious, cancer. And if you're as Lauren Freyr has been covering this from London, Lauren, thanks for being with us. Thanks for having me, Scott. Tabloids, more circumspect now. For now, at least today, the headlines in all the papers here say things like, Kate, you are not alone. Kate, cancer, shock, all sort of extolling love and support for the Princess. That's a big turnaround from even a couple days ago when the UK tabloids were speculating about whether Kate's abdominal surgery was actually a nervous breakdown. Why that Mother's Day photo of her and her children was Photoshopped. But the palace was keeping from the public. Stephen Colbert on his TV show, joked about rumors that Kate's husband will was having an affair. The headline in the Atlantic magazine, now, reads, I hope you all feel terrible now. Here's a woman named Sheena Best whom we caught up with at London's Victoria Station. It's so sad. I was saying it's really sad that she's been hindered in the grass for the last couple of weeks and then for that news to come out. It's so, it's so sad. What I hope all the grass to eat for you really guilty is God help her. That's just really sad. So there's definitely some shame and introspection about the media culture here. Lauren, what do we actually know about the diagnosis of the Princess and her treatment plan? We don't know much. We know she was hospitalized for 13 days back in January for abdominal surgery. At the time, the guidance we got from the palace was that this was not cancer. But then Kate said in this video last night that post-op tests showed cancer had been present. The palace says she started treatment in late February. They're calling what she's getting though preventative chemotherapy. Now as you know, Scott King Charles also has cancer. For both him and Kate, we don't know the type of cancer. We don't know the stage where the treatment is happening for how long it'll last, known of that. The king did issue a statement last night saying he's proud of his daughter-in-law and he's in touch with her often. How did they manage to make this video without anyone knowing it was coming? Yeah, the palace tells us it was recorded two days before its release somewhere outdoors in Windsor. That's West of London where Kate and William live. It was filmed by a BBC studio's camera person, only a handful of people knew about its existence. Kate is shown sitting on a garden bench dressed casually, looking relaxed, her hair and waves down her shoulders. And it seems designed to reassure people that she's okay. But also to kind of tell them to back off in the most polite royal words, of course, here's part of the video. They hope that you'll understand that as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment. She mentions her three children. The youngest is just five years old. She says it's taken some time to explain this to them. She also talks about her husband, William, and calls him a quote, great source of comfort and reassurance. And of course, he's the heir to the throne, his father and his wife are now both in treatment for cancer. How does all this affect the monarchy? Well, this is already what they're calling a slimmed down monarchy, you know, with Prince Harry and Prince Andrew, both having stepped down from royal duties. And of course, this is after the loss of Queen Elizabeth around 18 months ago, with the King getting his own cancer treatment, Queen Camilla has been stepping into handle some of his duties. So this will overall be a bigger workload for an ever smaller number of working royals. And you know, Scott Kate ranks absolutely number one in polls of which royal is most beloved here. The palace had said she would be back on duty sometime after Easter. That looks pretty uncertain now. Lauren Freire, thank you. You're welcome. And that's up first for Saturday, March 23rd, 2024.

Saturday, March 16, 2024, I'm Chad Hurtman. TikTok, should it be banned, Congress makes a move, and surprise departures from the house. 340 some people, I think 350, that voted for this, Democrats, Republicans, a like, that sends a pretty strong signal that this is something that is urgent needs to get done, and this Senate just simply can't ignore. I'm Jessica Rosenthal, our American relations with Israel fraying over the war in Gaza, or just for some Democrats. Certainly within the administration, they're pushing back, they want to really make sure that civilians in Gaza are protected to a higher degree, but at the same time, I don't think there's real concern that the level of support will actually stop. Isha, you've covered the TikTok story very closely, and you had a big get this week. Tell us about that. Well, you know, we've been sort of searching for TikTok CEO, Sho Chiu. We'd heard that he was going to be on Capitol Hill this week, sort of lobbying for really, essentially trying to kill this house bill to force TikTok to sell. And we finally saw him this week, and we chased him down, and I got to ask him some questions, and the number one question I had to ask was, why doesn't fight dance just sell? Just do what the bill sets out to do, because he continuously says that, you know, the bill is a ban, that it's going to ban the App Nation Y, which is not true. So I just asked him, why not just sell? And he told me, look, it's not feasible in the time span that the bill lays out. I think it's about six months it gives to TikTok or bite dance to find a different owner. And he says it's not feasible. To which the House China Competition Committee, I think, had a very interesting response, and they basically said, so TikTok is admitting that it would rather sacrifice its users and revenue than severer ties with a genocidal communist regime, those were the words from the committee. So this argument goes on and on and on, as now this bill is sort of stalled in the Senate, and we don't know what Chuck Schumer is going to do. He's just said that they're reviewing the bill, but beyond that, sort of up in the air whether or not this actually will come to the fore for a vote, a few Democrats have told us, including Mark Warner, who is the intel chair, that he believes that it might be changed a little, the language, but he does think that eventually we'll see this come up for a vote on the floor. But the biggest, I think, part of the story, I think I was surprised by, and many others were, was the bipartisan vote in the House. I mean, you're talking about 340 some people, I think 350, that voted for this, Democrats, Republicans alike, that sends a pretty strong signal that this is something that is urgent, needs to get done, and the Senate just simply can't ignore. Yeah, that was a pretty amazing vote. There are 352 to 65 opposed one member voting present, and talk to us for a moment, Aisha, about the idea that when you get such a large vote in the House of Representatives, how that places pressure on the Senate, this is a big bipartisan vote here, to do something. I mean, Maria Cantwell, she did not exactly slam the door. She's the Democratic Center for Washington State, but chairs the Commerce Committee here. Chuck Schumer has been a little more circumspect about this, but Cantwell, she didn't outright rule out taking up the House bill. Right, and like I said, I mean 300 is not nothing, it's definitely a message to the Senate that this is very important to the House to members of both parties. I mean, there were definitely progressives and others, your libertarians, that felt like this was sort of not a constitutional bill, and they had their own reasons for not supporting it, but I mean, for the vast majority, they want something done on this bill. Now, there are those in the Senate that agree with that consensus that something should be done about TikTok, certainly because of its ties to the CCP, but the language they might want to go back and read over and change a little bit so that in their minds it's not problematic. What I think is interesting is this sort of these mixed signals that you're getting from the two presumptive nominees, right, of both parties. You've got President Biden, who is willing to sign this House bill, the White House supports it, but the Biden campaign is actively using the app to reach out to young voters, and it's working. And even Mark Warner said he thought it was mixed messages here. And then you've got the former president, former president, Trump, who's sort of flip-flopped, his stance too, first signing that executive order to ban TikTok in 2020. Now, he's opposed to a nationwide ban for various reasons. He thinks that all those people might turn to Facebook, and then Facebook becomes incredibly powerful. I think that was remarkable about that. It was. Yeah. And I think that's really a really interesting dynamic going on in the background too in this election season, where when you think about it, very a lot of young people, Chad, get their news from TikTok, and we're only about eight months away from an election, you would think that Congress would want to do something about it. They really do feel like the CCP is controlling this app. You know, and that's the amazing thing here, and here's the statement from former President, Trump. He said, if you get rid of TikTok, Facebook, and Zucker, Schmock will double their business. I don't want Facebook who cheated in the last election doing better. They are a true enemy of the people exclamation point, and that's what he put on truth social. You know, there's two other dynamics in this. I want to ask you about that. I was struck by in this whole debate, politics do make strange bedfellows. You had these very liberal members, Robert Garcia, a Democrat from Southern California and others, who opposed the bill because they said, you know, creators and people who are trying to get their message out, or this silence is certain alternative opinions and things. And it was a broader First Amendment argument that he was making. But here's something else that I picked up on as well. Is that there are people who are very suspect of what happens in Washington. People who are very suspect of Congress. And I started to wonder if maybe Congress with this big overwhelming vote was completely out of step with the voters to say nothing of the people who just used TikTok on a daily basis and see this is, oh, this is big government coming in and encroaching on us once again. But that they viewed this people who are on the far right as a big conspiracy again because they don't trust social media to start with. But they're like, oh, what is being posted under First Amendment grounds that might be sort of conspiratorial or something that's going out there that this is an effort to trample this. There's something out there that they don't want us to know. And I found that to be a very interesting narrative. Yeah, there's, I mean, that, right, you're right. There's there's two dynamics, right? The suspicious and then those that are thinking about this politically. For example, Rokana, I got to talk to him right after the House vote. And he basically said, you know, why? Why would you want to upset young people? 170 million people use this app. That's incredible. This is the most popular platform out there. I mean, you and I are not on it just because we just have so much going on. But, I mean, this is, I mean, you think about the House taking on Goliath. And so he's saying, like, look, there's other ways, less restrictive ways of achieving the goal that we're all trying to achieve. We're all on the same page here. But to basically, essentially, pass something that would ban TikTok if they don't divest. Why would you do that? And to, you know, to be honest, risk the potential of losing those young people come November. Why? That's what he was asking. On the other hand, you have people like Nancy Mays and Marjorie Taylor Green, as you said, who are just thinking, this is not constitutional. And this is like, overreaching. So, yes, those dynamics, I think, are going to play out in the Senate. And that's where the Senate might take weeks, months. Who knows? I mean, this doesn't seem to feel like it's going to be done in a matter of days. And that's where it gets a little tricky here, right? I mean, the longer this stalls in the Senate, the better chance show chew of TikTok has to sort of undermine this. And maybe that's what they want to do is maybe take their time in the Senate. You know, there's an old saying here that the Senate is where the House is hot coffee cools. And so this is the hot coffee. You know, this bill came together very, very fast in the House of Representatives, a markup session, very quick, went to the floor very quick, passed very quickly. I didn't even go to the rules committee. So maybe this is it cooling. And again, maybe the Senate might want to kind of take a step back. And no one has said this directly to me, but, you know, maybe see if chew can, can sell it or the Chinese government can sell it. And then they don't have to deal with this problem because they've sent the message in the House of Representatives. Well, or maybe they want to do their own work, right? And there's some lawmakers that would love to see chew come to the Senate side. And would love to do a hearing and have an opportunity to question and grill him directly before they decide to do anything. So we could see that too. We could see around two of chew on the hell. There's sure you will be there to get him. Yeah. Because you did a great job with that. I will certainly try. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What I also think is interesting is that several lawmakers have also told me, look, we've got other more pressing matters to attend to, which includes obviously funding the government, which is always pressing matter, but also foreign aid is something that is being talked about and a very big speech this week by the majority leader, Chuck Schumer, who for the first time was incredibly critical of Israel and made some pretty harsh remarks and sort of almost calling for a change in government in Israel. Yeah. So Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, I mean, he is the highest ranking Jewish official in the American government. And they build this in his office that he was going to make a major policy statement about Israel. He certainly did that. Basically saying that Benjamin Netanyahu is now being controlled by the extreme right and that he doesn't want Israel to become a pariah on the world stage, you know, because the view of Israel now is much different than it was, considering how hardly they've struck back at Hamas on this. And they say, of course, we have a right to defend ourselves. And so that was rather remarkable to have Chuck Schumer come in and do this. Now keep in mind that there have been criticisms from the left in the Democratic party about how they have handled the Middle East situation, certainly directed at the President. I wonder if maybe Schumer was trying to maybe, you know, guide the argument there a little bit to, you know, and take some of the heat off the President and maybe suggest to the President. Maybe this is the policy we should be taking and that will qualify some of those on the left who are very concerned about what's happening in Gaza and with Hamas and humanitarian issues there. So that's one part of that. Brian Schott, who's a Democratic member from Hawaii and also Jewish, he commented that after the speech that this was quote, gutsy. So he applauded him. Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont who was, you know, wanted to just couple of Democrats who voted against the overall Ukraine aid bill that had money in there for Taiwan and Israel, of course, you know, some weeks ago. He came up to Schumer after the speech and congratulated him. Peter Welch, after they passed that bill, got on the floor early on that Tuesday morning, some weeks ago and said, you know, the reason that he voted against the bill was because how the aid was going to Israel and he didn't like how Israel was composing itself. So this is winning some plotlets in certain sectors of the Democratic Party. Now you talk about the criticism from Republicans. You have some moderate Democrats, first of all, who were opposed and didn't like what Schumer did. But then you have Republicans who saw this opening, Aisha, I don't think I have ever seen the minority leader or the other leader on the other side criticize on the floor immediately after a speech and give such a harsh rebuke of the other leader on the floor. And that is exactly what Mitch McConnell did on the floor the other day. He said that we are not, we shouldn't be meddling in the affairs of Israel. They are a sovereign nation. He thought that, you know, we're telling their voters what to do. He really didn't like that Lindsey Graham, the Republican from South Carolina said as much as well. I mean, this was, this was one of those seminal moments. But again, if you parse this in the internal politics of the Democratic Party, they have a problem post October 7th. And so, you know, this is both President Biden and Senator Schumer trying to figure out how do you thread this needle and keep in mind that Schumer has an awful lot of Jewish American constituents who are very supportive of Israel and what they've been doing post 10, 7 here. And probably are very frustrated with him right now. So again, and maybe it's easier for Chuck Schumer to do it in this way than it is for President Biden to do it in this way. And I wonder and I wonder too. And obviously the White House had to know what remarks Schumer was about to make. But I mean, just just a few days ago, we were all talking about how the President was caught on a hot mic on the floor of the state of the Union telling his colleagues that, you know, he and Yahoo, here soon have to come to a have to have a come to Jesus moment, a meeting. And you heard, you know, his colleagues and Pete Buttigieg was there and others sort of laughing at that comment. So that obviously didn't go over well with a lot of folks. And then you have this speech a few days later. I think it is a political problem for Democrats, especially in states like Michigan where you had, you know, almost 10% uncommitted vote recently by Arab and Muslim Americans. These are people that I talk to weekly. And I've talked to Arab and Muslims, Arab Americans and Muslim Americans in the Midwest down in the South in Texas. And what they're telling me is their relationship to the Democratic Party is over. I mean, they are so beyond angered by what has happened and the inaction in their perspective by this White House that that relationship is now over. Even if it's eight months away, the election, they don't see themselves even going to the ballot box. I'm not saying that they're going to go vote for Trump, but they don't see themselves in any way, shape or form supporting the current president. So that's something that he has to also figure out how to navigate. That is a real danger for the president in a swing state like Michigan, which he won barely last time around, but won 15 electoral votes. There's about 400,000 Arab American or Muslim voters in Michigan. And again, if you lose that block, I mean, that's one of the reasons that he won that block in 2020, frankly. So if there's no way to bridge that gap and of course you had people vote uncommitted there and in Minnesota a couple of weeks ago, you know, that is a gaping hole in that coalition for the Democrats. Another problem in November is going to be for House Republicans. This has been a rough road for them this past year and a half and for Speaker, Mike Johnson, who a few days ago was pretty surprised by Ken Bucks news that he's going to resign immediately from Congress and really, really, really hurts Johnson's numbers now. Yeah, well, you always hear me say it's all about the math and it really is about the math. Now, a couple of things on this. So effectively, Ken Bucks leaves at the end of next week. The GOP majority goes down to two votes. It's been at two votes, but you know, now if there's a tie, then it's over. So that's in on the floor. But if you look at the delta in terms of the difference of members, there's about a four or five member difference. So it's not like the House is going to flip eminently, but here's the interesting thing about this. Ken Bucks was going to retire at the end of the Congress. Then he made this kind of snap decision that I'm going to leave at the end of next week. So that number goes down. At the end of April, there is a special election in Western New York for the seat held by Brian Higgins, a Buffalo, if Democrats win that seat, then the margin goes down to one. Republicans might get a seat back here if they win the special election in California for Kevin McCarthy's seat in May. But again, you are one untimely death, God forbid, away from something happening. You might have other people say, hey, you know, I have an opportunity to leave the hill. Why am I putting up with all these headaches here? I can make a big paycheck and maybe go. I mean, there have been some people indicate to me that maybe the House, it might flip in the middle of the Congress. That's never happened. And again, as I pointed out that four or five vote margin, you know, the total delta there between how many Democratic seats there are and how many Republican seats there are, you know, that takes a lot there. But, you know, somebody said to me, I would not be surprised if you get past the election. So you're in the lame.congress here. And then the House flips because people are like, you know, we lost or won one or whatever we did. And here's my opportunity to start on this new job or this new paycheck or why do I put up with all the headaches here? We can't get anything done. We're frustrated. Members are at each other's throat. This is why we almost had physical violence up here a couple of months ago between Kevin McCarthy and Tim Burchard and others. People really don't think this is a nice place to be anymore. And so again, that would be pretty wild. We've had the Senate flip in the middle of the Congress, but not the House of Representatives, I should. And again, it's that tension. Well, I mean, tell us what you're seeing in that. There is absolute tension. And there's frustration. And, you know, people come here to make a difference. You know, there's a lot of folks here that come here for the right reasons. And, you know, Congressman Gallagher, for example, the chairman of the China Competition Committee, as he was pushing this TikTok bill forward. I asked him, you know, if this passes in the House with an overwhelming majority, and let's say it passes in the Senate, and this gets signed, you know, into law, would it make you think twice about leaving? Would it make you want to stay? Because you got something done. And he just laughed at me and he said, no, I think, I think Congress will survive, you know, even after I'm gone. But he's, I think he's one of those that is probably ready for something new, because of, you know, just sort of feeling like, you know, Congress really doesn't accomplish much. I had a private conversation with one lawmaker who is also leaving at the end of his term. And I asked him, you know, why are you leaving? And he said, have you seen what's been happening in the House? I mean, we can't get anything done. It's just nothing but chaos. And he told me that he expects even more people to decide that they're not running for re-election. So, I mean, there's this sort of feeling, you need to start to feel the frustration a lot, right? When Speaker McCarthy was ousted, and people were getting really, really, really angry about, you know, the motion of AK, and they wanted that to change. But started to see it during the Speaker's election at the beginning of the Congress. Absolutely. Absolutely. And January 30th. It's sort of like this motion of AK, it has really been a thorn in their side this entire time. So, which I was just reading or a port that apparently they're open to changing that come November after November. So, so we'll see if that happens. But I think there is absolutely a sense of anger and frustration and just restlessness and certainly a surprise that so many of these rising stars within the Republican ranks have decided, you know, to throw in the towel. But I think it also tells this really interesting story, Chad, of where the Republican Party is headed towards as we head towards November. Because there is a split, you know, of two ideologies and you have those institutional Republicans. And then you have the matter of Republicans, people who want to see changes like this in the party and who are frankly happy that some of these people are leaving. And you're seeing a little bit of that now in, bubble up in the Senate as well. Now that Mitch McConnell is no longer going to be leader, there's sort of this opening for, you know, for the party to shift in a new direction. So, all of that is sort of playing as well in the background of this. But I think in the next eight months here, certainly after November, Congress and certainly the GOP might look very, very different. You know, and the other thing about this, you know, you could have a scenario because of the people who are departing the House where President Biden wins re-election, yet there are more so-called MAGA Republicans in the House. Even if they lose control of the House, that could be what the Republican conference is. You certainly have that dynamic in the Senate with Mitch McConnell stepping down from leadership and other people retiring, people in the middle, you know, Joe Manchin. I mean, it doesn't mean that the MAGA movement goes away if former President Trump does not win re-election. They might have more more forces here on Capitol Hill. Something I was looking at the other day was looking at JD Vance, the Republican Center for Mojillo, who there was a profile on him in Politico talking about kind of the new MAGA and maybe even a different type of MAGA than what former President Trump was able to offer. So this is what's going to be very interesting to see, not so much what the numbers are, but understand where people stand who make up the Congress in the next year or two. Absolutely. It's going to be wildly different. Yes, absolutely. Well, I should, again, kudos on the big get this week excellent work, ACE reporting, and we will visit soon. The week began with discussion about Israel and the light of President Biden saying in an interview that a red line for him would be Israel going into the southern Gaza City of Rafa in a way that results in many more Palestinian deaths. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said from the White House one question whether future eight Israel is conditioned upon how Rafa is handled said those reports are based on speculation and he wouldn't comment on hypotheticals adding a ceasefire is on the table today for six weeks to be built on into something more enduring if Hamas would simply release. Women wounded and elderly and the fact that they will not do so says a lot to me about Hamas's regard for innocent Palestinian civilians. The next day Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor. Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish politician in the U.S., said Netanyahu has been too willing to tolerate the civilian casualties in Gaza and that as a result support for Israel is falling. I believe a new election is the only way to allow for a healthy and open decision-making process about the future of Israel. Several Republicans expressed outrage including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. It is grotesque and hypocritical for Americans who hyperventilate about foreign interference in our own democracy to call for the removal of the democratically elected leader of Israel. This is unprecedented. And Friday President Biden was asked about Schumer's remarks. I'm not going to exaggerate on the speech. He made a good speech and I think he expressed a serious concern. He's shared not only by Hamas but by many Americans. Multiple Israeli politicians issued statements rejecting Schumer's remarks, but do they highlight shifting opinions about Israel among Democrats? 42% side more with the Palestinians. Absolutely are they fraying, certainly with the White House? They have been for the last couple months or so. He was severely injured two years ago in Ukraine and has since reported from Israel as well. Seeing Schumer call for elections in our closest ally in the Middle East, a democratic country the first time I know of something like that happening. It is a big move. They're in the middle of a conflict right now against a terror group called Hamas and there are calls for there to be elections. Now look, I do understand. I've been on the ground. I was there recently in Israel concerns about Netanyahu that he's reached out to the far right. Nevertheless, he has been elected in. The next elections until 2026. So to somehow start calling for another election, just seems to me a really dangerous move, frankly, to be making over here. And Israelis, I mean, polling seems to indicate that while Israelis support, I guess a lot of what Netanyahu is talking about regarding Gaza, that they don't necessarily support him. And a lot of that has to do with the war, with how this even happened in the first place. Yes. A lot of questions about how this was happening. And perhaps were the eyes of the military watching the border where they distracted because there had been a lot of protests across Israel over Netanyahu's plan to change the judiciary system. And so a lot of people thought that even at that point, the Netanyahu should perhaps call another election. But after the start of the October 7th attack, the feeling was at least the country was totally unified on having to get rid of the threat of Hamas. One of the places that there is also disagreements is what is the number one priority. And I've spoken to a number of family members of the hostages being held inside Gaza. And there is concern that the priority is getting rid of Hamas rather than bringing the hostages home. And most people think that sadly, it's going to be very hard to do both. And the military is waiting to go into Raffa at the moment. The ceasefire deals have not happened. It looks like they're going into Raffa. It looks like they will do their best to defeat Hamas at least militarily. But that sadly means that the chance of hostages coming back is getting lower and lower. And that's why quite a few people in Israel are upset. Yeah, we'll talk about that in a minute. But I also want your thoughts about some of the continued, I guess, tension out of Washington regarding this relationship we have with Israel. Because Israelis from multiple political sides heard what President Biden said this week and heard what leader Schumer said this week. And they were upset. I mean, opposition leader Benny Gantt said Israel is a strong democracy. Only its citizens will determine its future. And any external intervention in the matter is incorrect and unacceptable. Former PM Naftali Bennett, who is not exactly on the side of Netanyahu, said, you know, with the threat of terrorism on its way to the West, it would be best if the international community would assist Israel in its war. Is Israel preparing for the possibility of less U.S. support in the future? Yes and no. The fact is, yes, they are afraid and people I speak to say we're concerned that suddenly within the administration, they're pushing back, they want to really make sure that civilians in Gaza are protected to a higher degree. But at the same time, I don't think there's real concern that the level of support will actually stop. It does feel as if President Biden is making quite a lot of noise about it at the moment. But he knows politically what would happen if he started to reduce weapons going to Israel. If he really tightened up what was happening there. If he has said that there could perhaps be, it would be a red line, is what President Biden said, if the Israeli military go into Rafa and that perhaps they could hold back some military assistance. But the question is, he said, first of all, that would not be the iron dome to protect it. But the only thing it could be, perhaps some of the guided weapons that the Israelis are using inside Gaza. But if they reduce those, Israel is going to start using the non-targeted weapons that they have lots of. And so the irony is that there's nothing that Biden can really stop that is going to affect the Israelis in a big way. So yes, they don't like the way the tone is going, but they haven't frankly listened to anything the administration has said so far. Biden has been saying for a long time, you must watch out for this, you must do this differently. And frankly, the Israelis haven't really listened. And I don't think Benjamin Netanyahu is frankly planning on doing so at the moment. So it's interesting that one thing that they have agreed to do is give a lot more aid to Gaza. And I think we will see over the coming weeks a lot more trucks going in. But I don't think they're really concerned that military aid is going to actually stop. Let's talk about the fluidity of the situation on the ground. It sounds like there are reports indicating that Qatar and Egypt have been pressuring Hamas to reach some kind of deal that involves a ceasefire here and that the pressure is stronger than it was before. But Israel has said there are demands for more prisoners and that Israel leave the area entirely are not going to happen. And then on the other side of things you have on Friday, I'm going to Mr. Netanyahu, approving plans for an operation in Rafa. We don't know exactly what those plans would be, but this is the place where many Palestinians fled to to the south when Israel was operating in the north. It seems like this is this is sort of a very tense moment, you know, after five months of all of this. It is a tense moment in Benjamin Netanyahu. And the Israelis have said that we have cleared most of the north and to do that we had to push many people in Gaza down to the south and to Rafa. Now about 1.3 million people are down there. And I think the plan is to now have to move them up north or to the middle around Khan Unis so they can go inside Rafa where they say about a quarter of Hamas remains inside. Now, Benjamin Netanyahu said the red line for him is making sure that October 7th doesn't happen again. And the only way to do that he says is to go into Rafa and get rid of Hamas. The other important thing about Rafa is that it borders the Egyptian border, which is where so many of the weapons and the tunnels do come across. And it is key for the Israelis that they do need to control that both now as well as for the future. So that's that's why I think it's almost certain that they will go in. They just have to find a way of moving some of the civilians north. You mentioned the ceasefire. And what's really interesting is that they've been going back and forth the Qataris, the Americans, the Egyptians have all been sitting down with the Israelis and Hamas. But the one point that they simply cannot agree on from the very beginning has been the total removal of Israeli soldiers from Gaza. And Benjamin Netanyahu has said clearly as I have the idea if that's never going to happen. And that is the one thing that Hamas says has to happen. The Israelis would happily exchange prisoners. You know, in 15 years ago, they exchanged a thousand Israeli prisoners for one Palestinian prisoners for one Israeli soldier and included among those thousands was a Sinwa who was the current head of Hamas. So they would, the current deal that was just put on the table today, yesterday, it was asking for 700 to a thousand Palestinians to be released. A hundred of them from high security. The Israelis would do that. You know, they've shown they would do them the past, but what they will not agree on is total removal of all Israeli troops. There's no movement there. It sounds like both sides really are talking about something existential. Israel's saying we have to destroy you. And Hamas is saying, well, you're going to destroy us. Well, we've already told you we're going to destroy you. This sounds like there can't really be an end if both sides are committed to destruction, but one is committed to the destruction of a terrorist organization. And that brings me to this, this idea that the US had said, or the US officials had said that they want out of Israel a more targeted, special ops type response to go after Hamas and Rafa. And given that Israel is quite a moral army and drops leaflets and lets people know when activity is happening or has in the past, I'm sure Israel would love to have a more targeted operation and not kill people. But when Hamas is operating in a way in which they hide behind children and people in tunnels, how would you, like, how could the US make this request that this be a more targeted operation? What would target it even look like in this case? It is the sad reality that Hamas knows that global attention or rather global support, any support for Israel is diminishing day by day. And that happens with the increased number of Palestinian civilians killed. And Hamas, to be honest, does, understands that civilians will be killed. In fact, for them, the higher the civilian death toll, the more people will come to their side. And that's why, as you said, they've used them as human shields. They hide under schools and hospitals. They put their tunnels there. So it puts Israel in a very, very difficult situation. What does targeted mean? It means going door to door with Israeli soldiers and knocking down those doors and trying to find the bad guys. And that leads to a very, very high number of Israeli deaths among their soldiers. That's a vulnerable place to be in. Exactly. So that's what it's very hard for them to do. But look, there are no positive outcomes here at all. There are innocent civilian families inside guards are being killed. There's no doubt in that. But Hamas is the one who is using them as human shields, who is often not allowing them to flee certain areas so they can continue to hide behind them. And so it's a very hard decision that the Israelis have to make. Finally, Ben, what do we know about the future involvement of other countries here? We know other countries have not opened their doors to Palestinian refugees. But Egypt and Qatar have been involved heavily in hostage negotiations. We've even heard about Saudi Arabia being maybe involved in future plans. What do we know about from other, I guess, Arab countries? Yes, going back decades, you've had so many Gulf and Arab countries who all talk as loud as they can about supporting the Palestinians, doing what they have. But none of them will take any Palestinians. None of them will have any camps for the moment. And I understand that Jordan Lebanon doesn't want to because they already have millions of Palestinians and they have seen what it does to their economy. So they're very loud and complaining, but they don't offer many practical solutions. If you want to look at a solution for the future, you do need to figure out how Gaza can be rebuilt and under who. Let's assume that the Israeli defense forces do go into wrath and let's say they do get rid of most Hamas military. What happens after that is the big question. Now it does seem as if you need some kind of some kind of a government in the middle, a ruling party that can take the step forward. The Palestinians in authorities, they're not really wanted in there. But if they would work alongside the UAE or Egypt or Gulf states, for example, then that perhaps does lead the way to something positive. The flip side of that is that the Israelis will never want any Arab soldiers inside Gaza to oversee the transitions. So it's hard to see exactly how this will move forward. And I know it's all terrible. It's all pessimistic, but you have to hope, perhaps, perhaps if Hamas was totally defeated, could this be the one opportunity to lead a something positive? If you think of all the billions and billions of dollars that has been spent in Gaza over the last two decades, if that had been spent positively and building up an economy, Gaza could have become a great success story and it could have been peaceful. So can we now make sure this is the beginning where that starts to happen? When it needs a lot of countries working together, it's going to be a very difficult one, but you've got to hope there's a small chance of that happening.

Saturday, March 9th, 2024, I'm Jessica Rosenthal. A Supreme Court ruling this past week keeps former president Trump on the ballot. But will the justice aside with him in a future case, as the docket fills up with potential blockbusters this election year? If the court does something super narrow about immunity, there's a chance that something not completely terrible happens for the Trump legal team. I'm Jared Halpern. One of the most popular apps on the planet is closer to being banned in the US by Congress. We're told that high schoolers and middle schoolers were lighting up the phone lines on Capitol Hill because they were afraid they're going to get rid of Tik Toket. Former president Trump will remain on the ballots and states across the country. After the Supreme Court ruled that Colorado cannot kick him off. I think it will go a long way toward bringing our country together, which our country needs. Do believe that states have the ability under section three of the 14th amendment to decide to not put on our ballots, oath breaking insurrectionists? United States Supreme Court disagrees with that and says Congress has to act first. Congress has to pass some type of law allowing section three of the 14th amendment to be applied. After the decision, the former president complimented the justices and said that their next battle has to do with his belief that he should not be able to be prosecuted in his federal case involving January 6th and the 2020 election. He's charged with conspiracy to defraud the US and obstructing an official proceeding among other things. If a president doesn't have full immunity, you really don't have a president because nobody that is serving in that office will have the courage to make in many cases what would be the right decision or it could be the wrong decision. It could be in some cases the wrong decision, but they have to make decisions. Either way, the court isn't hearing that case until April and likely won't decide it until June, pushing a possible trial well into the year. Still this week, the president went in to Super Tuesday knowing his name would be on ballots across the country this election year. It did. And Jessica, can you believe that was this week? I feel like there have been 5,000 news cycles since that was just Monday when he had that big win at the Supreme Court, all states. And then there was someone noticed that while justices, so to my orc, Kagan and brown Jackson agreed Colorado should not get to kick Trump off the ballot. There was like a bit of a descent within the concurrence that said this ruling still went like too far. It addressed too much. Can you explain that? Yeah. And I had to, so this was a percurium opinion, meaning it speaks for the court. Essentially, everybody signs on to it. There's not an author, but there were these other concurrences that very much read like a descent, at least the one from the three justices that you mentioned. So to my or Jackson and Kagan, and it essentially said the main opinion went too far in directing Congress, how it should address this problem. What the limits would be on Congress and doing this. They felt like we agree with the bottom line question that Colorado couldn't do this and by extension, any state, but they didn't like that the court went into answering all of these other questions and giving Congress direct guidance on how they think they should solve the problem. So they thought those questions were to be left for another day. And it was an overreach by the what essentially was the majority opinion? Yeah. What was an example of like going to like, what did they address essentially that they that those three justices said, you shouldn't have gone there yet. So section three of the 14th amendment is the one that has the language about, if you've taken a note, if you've participated in an insurrection, but section five goes on to say that Congress is really the one that has to put together the teeth for enforcing these things. And so while states felt like in states like Colorado argued it was quote unquote self executing meaning what they laid out in section three means the states can jump in and be the ones to enforce it. What the court did was go on to say, Hey, listen, this is really left a Congress under section five. And there are limits on how they can do that. It's got to be narrowly tailored to the specific issue. I think there was so much instructional language there that the three concurrence folks who much again read like a dissent felt like it just went way beyond where this case needed to go. And they prefer what they argued is the historical guidepost of the court is that they most narrowly tailor their opinions and don't answer questions they don't need to get into answering. Interesting. After this ruling, Trump was very complimentary of the court. I wonder how long that might last though because the court has agreed to consider this fight over presidential immunity in the January six case. And just so everybody just for a reminder, he's charged there with conspiracy to defraud the US witness tampering conspiracy against the rights of citizens and obstruction of an attempt to obstruct an official proceeding. What will the justice is consider here narrowly? I guess when it comes to presidential immunity, like how far it extends essentially. Yeah. And you make such a great point because yes, President Trump had a ton of praise all caps. You know, like he likes to do. On Monday, I have a feeling that come June. It's going to be tempered. Now listen, if the court does something super narrow about immunity, there's a chance that something not completely terrible happens for the Trump legal team. But most folks look at the decision you got from the lower court, that three judge panel from the DC circuit that was 57 pages. It too was per Curia, meaning we're all in agreement sweeping saying that, you know, there are absolutely limits to immunity. For any president, you can't have somebody committing crimes, things that we would all know and recognize as such and just never be prosecuted because they happen to be president at one point. So I think it's going to be a much tougher fight at the Supreme Court. It is not going to be a 90 we all are cum by our Colorado ballot decision. But I think the court is really going to dig into this question and remember, special counsel Jack Smith in a filing back in December when he wanted the Supreme Court to hear the case said they were the only ones who could resolve a question of this import. Now after he got that great ruling from the DC circuit, basically told the Supreme Court like, okay, it settled. You don't need to get involved because the whole win for the Trump team is the delay to that Jack Smith trial, which was supposed to start last Monday. So even if president Trump ultimately isn't successful on the immunity argument, it's already a huge win for his team because it presses this trial likely closer to an August, September, even October start, if that's where it goes. And this was the case where one of the appellate justices right had said that it made it was quite incendiary at the time, claim like if a president like killed somebody, then you know, we'd be talking about does the president have immunity like no, there has to be a line, right? Is that right? Sort of that that was this. Yeah, during the oral arguments, there was a lot of pushback with these hypotheticals. Well, what about this? What about killing a person? What are doing, you know, and it made for some really awkward tough moments and arguments for the Trump legal team? Because I think everybody agrees there's gotta be some kind of limit on that. Now what president Trump will regularly say and his legal team says in their filings as well is it would essentially handcuff a president. A president can't be worried about carrying a drone strike or something involving a foreign leader or a threat because if so, president Trump said last week, it would turn into a ceremonial office. I think he said that this week again, the weeks are all blurring together. But he has said similar things in the past and talked about the fact that a president has to be free to make really difficult decisions without being worried that at some point, it would be turned into a criminal prosecution against him. And he argues that any president should be worried about that D or R behind their name because it's a dangerous precedent to set. So there's a lot for the Supreme Court to chew on. They will do that on April 25th. Okay. And now let's move away a little bit from from the Trump train because the Supreme Court also this week temporarily stopped the implementation of a Texas law that led state law enforcement handle border matters by arresting migrants who are undocumented. Is the problem here? The Immigration and Nationality Act is the law on this that such immigration matters are really under federal jurisdiction and Congress has already regulated that. I mean, that's always been the precedent. I remember covering Arizona's SB 1070 years ago. It was one of the papers law. I mean, it was one of the most rambunctious, raucous crowds. I've seen it. The court and I've seen them there for, you know, a portion in ACA and for same sex marriage and all kinds of things that have been very heated. But that one was especially crazy with then Governor James Brewer. I remember she got hit in the head by something outside of the court. I think, but it was just there was a lot jostling and craziness. And listen, the court basically said there we get your frustration. We get what you're doing, Arizona. But this is something that is left to the feds and that is precedent. That's constitutional. That's where it sits. Of course, the states now argue they are not doing what they're supposed to do. They're not enforcing the law. We have a right to defend ourselves and our borders, essentially, if the feds aren't doing it. So Arizona tried that argument. Things have changed. The court makeup has changed. We'll see. But for now, that that law is on hold while there's an emergency issue pending. The folks involved in the case haven't until I believe it is Wednesday to file their responses. And then the court will make a decision whether they're going to do something on an emergency basis while the case plays out on the actual merits. All right. We just have a couple minutes left, Shannon. Let's do a little bit of a lightning round brief understanding of a few more cases, the stakes. Justice will hear a case about an abortion drug. If a Pristone FDA approved, but a lower court judge took issue with the approval process for that drug arguments March 26th. What's it? Stay here. Yes. So you're not going to lose access to that drug, even if there is a losing argument to those who back it. It's essentially about the rollbacks to a couple of things about having to see a doctor in person, how late into a pregnancy it can be used. So the pill itself will remain out there and available, but there may be restrictions on access to it. If you know, the court rules in favor of those who are challenging that. And January 6th protesters, there's a case regarding whether or not they were improperly charged with obstructing official proceedings arguments are to be heard in mid-April. I imagine that sort of discussion in an election year with Trump on the ballot could generate a lot of interest. Yeah. And it could impact, you know, hundreds potentially of J6 defendants and it could impact President Trump's case that Jack Smith has pending against him because the charge they were looking at obstruction of an official proceeding. If they toss that, that's one of the charges that Smith has against Trump could impact his case too. And lastly, emergency room abortions. If a woman's life is in danger and she arrives at the ER and an abortion is required to save her life, would doctors be in trouble for performing that in states with strict abortion laws arguments to be heard in late April. That could be I imagine a pretty important case as well. Yeah, that's a really tricky one because states after the overturning of Roe v Wade made a lot of different decisions about how far or if at all into a pregnancy, they will allow abortions. There are folks that argue this guidance that came out from the Biden administration about how they have to operate in emergency rooms, emergency settings could force doctors who have conscience protections into performing an abortion they don't want to be involved with. So you got the state laws and conflict with the federal guidance from the Biden administration. Again, that means you've got two abortion cases that will likely land in June with a decision and that will be very important on the campaign trail in the middle of an election year. Shannon Bream, your mind is amazing. Thank you so much. Jessica, great stock with you. I'm Guy Benson. Joining the weekdays at 3 p.m. Eastern as we break down the biggest stories of the day with some of the biggest newsmakers and guests. The youth of America were often said to be apathetic, politically unengaged in the process. Now whether or not that's a fair description, this week certainly showed that when the right issue pops, they'll make their voices heard. Congressional offices have been bombarded with phone calls from young Americans, middle schoolers and teenagers over legislation that could block TikTok one of the most popular social media apps in the country from US networks. The House Energy and Commerce Committee voted 50 to nothing to advance a bill that would require TikTok to divest from its Chinese own developer or be prohibited in the United States. National security officials raise concerns about TikTok warning for an adversaries can use the app to surveil Americans and collect an awful lot of intelligence. Federal employees are not allowed to download the app on government devices. Well, Jared, as I say, TikTok boom, uh, 50 to nothing, as you say, in the Energy and Commerce Committee, they passed this bill, Steve Scalise, the majority leader says they're going to put it on the floor in the coming days. The reason that this is moving so quickly is that there's a real concern that TikTok is just scraping up inordinate amounts of information about Americans tracking where you go, uh, using this for nefarious purposes and even the outcry about this piece of legislation, those who are the backers of the legislation said this kind of underscores what we were talking about. Uh, the bill basically says that TikTok cannot operate in the United States unless it divests itself from bite dance, which is its Chinese quasi-government, uh, owner, and says, okay, you can't live on platforms or app stores here in the US. It has to be an independent thing away from bite dance. Uh, that's the problem. So, uh, they say this is not a ban on TikTok. That's something that TikTok, uh, takes issue with. They're saying that this is going to undercut the first amendment. So back to my point about why, uh, this kind of underscores the problem, you know, when, when you have, uh, Democrats and Republicans concerned about TikTok living on everyone's phones as a national security issue is that there was a, uh, a, a, a little, uh, prompt you could go to on TikTok once you heard about this. And if it's anything that's amazing, we're told that high schoolers and middle schoolers were lighting up the phone lines on Capitol Hill because they were afraid they're going to get rid of TikTok and calling, no less, calling minds, uh, middle schoolers. TikTok is, yeah, I was going to, I'm not on TikTok, uh, but man, I have a, a young son and a lot of his friends, I mean, I've seen the dances and everything. It's kind of a silly app in that regard, but there is to your point of concern that this is being used for nefarious purposes. And even President Biden, the White House has said, you know, we'll sign it. This has been negotiated by Congress. Talk to me about though those first amendment concerns. I mean, is there much precedent for the United States telling a private company to divest or face consequences? Well, think about this with the bells, you know, back in the early 80s or even, you know, with the forming of some of the, the big trust companies in the early part of the 20th century. Okay. So there's a little bit of precedent there. Uh, the difference here is that you have something that's foreign owned and is a national security concern that they are sucking up all of your information and following where you go. And this is where you had some of the Democrats and Republicans, especially Dan Crenshaw, who's Republican from Texas. He said, look at the outcry over this app, uh, people calling Capitol Hill. He said is that they have been a nerd to what's going on. And therefore, they're so upset. They're so obsessed with this, uh, app. It's like it's a drug, uh, which is exactly what, what they're concerned about. Uh, and you allude to, you know, somebody in your family or whatnot, you know, they love TikTok. They love being on it. He said, well, what, what point does China start to really make this kind of a psychological operation and go after people in that sense and kind of try to change public opinion? Uh, then they've won because they've won the hearts and minds. And the most interesting thing I find about TikTok here, Jared, is that if you look at TikTok in China and you're a kid, oh, it's very different. Only for it, you can only spend 40 minutes a day on it. Number one, they show you science and nature and educational videos and things of things with that sort. And it's silly. Unless they're scientifically, you know, dealing with a dance move or something, perhaps. But no, but that's the thing is that this is, this is programmed very differently in the people's Republic of China. So, you know, it brings up a lot of interesting points. I guess, you know, the house says to your point, they're going to vote on this in a matter of days. The Senate expect, I mean, this has supported in the Senate as well. Unclear. I mean, this is something that has been mostly a house project and you know, the pace that which things go around here on Capitol Hill, Jared. This one's moving fast. The fact that this kind of came out of nowhere just a few days ago, went through committee. They would still have to mark it up in committee and then put it on the floor in Steve Scolise, as I said, wants to put this on the floor at the end of next week. That's really fast. I mean, that is lightning speed here on Capitol Hill. The Senate, though, if they get a wide bipartisan margin, though, they might say, yeah, we have to put this on. I mean, there's no divide between the House and the Senate in terms of of the concerns there. I mean, Josh Hawley, the Republican Center from Missouri, he has expressed a lot of concerns about Tik Tokka for one. He's been very outspoken on that score. There are going to be some, a little more reservation from some members, frankly, because they're going to say, wait a minute, should we be stepping on an entire industry or a particular company? And you get into some of that, you know, there's some Supreme Court cases that deal with that and what the, you know, as I say, trusts and you go back to one of the most famous Supreme Court cases of all time, colloquially referred to as Youngstown Steel, which was the threat of the federal government dealing with the, you know, the steel industry in Northeastern Ohio back in the 1950s. So, yes, they will take a little more time with it, but there is concern in the Senate about the national security implications of Tik Tok too. Well, in listen, we've heard those national security concerns here at the White House that the national security advisor has talked about it at the national security council has talked about it, but at the same time, you know, the Biden campaign has faced some criticism because they are new to Tik Tok. They joined Tik Tok within the last couple of weeks. It is raised questions about, well, why is the White House on one hand raising all of these concerns and telling Americans not to be on this platform and the campaign is and the campaign says this and we're going to talk to people where they are. There are a lot of people chat on Tik Tok. They are younger, a group of voters or potential voters that a lot of politicians would love to reach. Are we going to see some of that calls of hypocrisy with some of these congressional and Senate campaigns? It's almost as though they are talking out of two sides of their mouth. I mean, Katie Britt, the Republican Center from Alabama, who spoke and gave a response to the president's address alluded to this in her comments the other night. I ask Roger Christian Amorthi, Democrat from Illinois, who is the top Democrat on the China Committee and one of the most ardent advocates of this bill, same question. And he said, I'm not going to tell them how to run their campaign. He said, but they should be very careful in using this. So I do think that there's a little bit of a difference here when it comes to national security and what the administration is hoping to do and what they're doing as it pertains to campaigning because again, you know, you would be foolish in some sense if you're if you're Joe Biden and you're the oldest president ever and you're trying to reach young voters, well, where would you go? You meet them where they are. That's right. That's Tik Tok. And that's the constantly face. Well, in they are younger, you talked about sort of high school and middle school kids calling members of Congress. Calling. Sure. Yeah, that's not sending text or DMs, but I am curious, I guess, that's not a constituency that obviously votes is not always really represented. I am just curious kind of from like the political science symposium perspective. If we were talking about an app that we're used by adults more than teens and tweens, would this be sailing through Congress in the way that it is now? Well, think about regulation for other things. Think about like tobacco products, alcohol. Tobacco is probably a really good one. Alcohol, a really good one if you look at historically what we did with prohibition here, you know, more than 100 years ago and then repealing that less than 100 years ago. That was mainly an adult product. Okay. Certainly with smoking, the idea that they didn't want to outlaw smoking and tobacco products and that's where they you know, they banned advertising on television effectively. And because there were some first amendment issues that they said, okay, can still advertise in magazines and so on and so forth. Of course, we had the big tobacco settlement in the 1990s, late 1990s, 1997 that started to change some of that. But plaster on every time you would have an ad or a cigarette pack, you know, these very stark warnings. You know, the surge in general has deemed that consumption of this product is smoking as cigarettes is dangerous to your health or you know, that's where I mean very straight. You didn't see that on any other product and it didn't completely inhibit people from smoking, frankly. So, you know, and some people might even make the argument about the the lure and the addictive quality of it. You know, maybe, you know, I haven't heard him, I say this, but you know, there is digital nicotine in TikTok. Absolutely. It's a good point and it's a fascinating thing is I know Congress is kind of wrestling with this space. I think it's kind of part of the AI conversation. We've certainly seen the heads of social media companies have to testify in front of Congress. So, this is a space that the Congress is certainly trying to, I think, find its foothold and find where they kind of play a role. It will be a fascinating debate, I think, to watch moving forward because the year point 50 to nothing in a committee does not happen every day in this House of Representatives. As we talk about the House of Representatives, another thing to talk about chat is, you know, government funding. I was surprised to see how quickly this, I guess we're calling it a mini bus, this package of appropriations bills kind of started to work its way through. Can everybody breathe these? Can everybody breathe easy now? Are we done with CRs for a little bit now? Or is this about the rear? It's ugly head right in the heart of an election season. As we speak right now, we are not completely out of the woods. The House of Representatives moved very quickly. The Senate is still trying to wrestle and figure out how to proceed and finish this up. So, that's a big question. So, you know, there is a threat of a partial government shutdown. They thought they might be able to come to an agreement quickly on Friday that did not necessarily, you know, happen. But the fact that the House was able to move this with, you know, more than 300 votes. And again, and again, and again, they did it with way more Democrats than Republicans, but yet these conservatives are willing to say, you know, we don't like what you're doing. They're Mike Johnson, but we're okay with you. We weren't okay when Kevin McCarthy did one intro spending bill. You've now done three of the questions. I mean, that's my question. I mean, this is to your point, this mini bust that this, you know, kind of putting together a bunch of appropriations bills got a lot of support from Democrats. What does that mean for Mike Johnson? Well, that's the problem right there is that at some point that chicken is going to come home to roost because he cannot continue to talk a good game and say, this is what we're doing and we're getting somewhere. They got some minimal cuts. They got a few things they wanted. You know, both sides were probably pleased with what they got, but you have just this core of conservatives who just don't like to spend any might want to go back to a couple of years before and the policy writers that they'd like to see. I don't know that any of those bills could pass. They can talk about them a lot, but they don't have the votes. Why? Because guess what? It's about the math. Mike Johnson does not have math in his favor right now when it pertains to these votes. And even though there's been some sweating of the palms about getting the government funded this weekend, I think I would look really deeply at that deadline for the next miniboss. This is a tranche of six bills here. There are six remaining outstanding appropriations bills that they need to do by the 22nd of March. Those are more nettlesome dealing with the Department of Labor, labor H as we call it, labor health and human services, the Pentagon, DHS, boy, that's going to be a monster right there. And to get this all done before the 22nd of December, and part of the reason we saw this clash and slow down in the Senate speaks to why we might have the risk of a shutdown then, is because you might be able to get a bill that moves through the House with again lots of Democrats and some Republicans. And Mike Johnson might be able to weather that storm again, but again, to do it in that period of time and get it across the finish line by the 22nd of March, when you have these conservatives who are now emboldened. You see, here's the new factor that nobody's thought about yet. You had these other conservatives who were willing to say, okay, we don't like these bills, but give us these votes on these amendments in the Senate and we'll subject them to 60 vote thresholds and we'll stretch things out a couple of days, but we'll go home by Friday and everything will be funded. The difference now is that Mitch McConnell has announced that he's out the door and you have people wanting to move into leadership, move into his position. Rick Scott, Republican from Florida has been posturing on this, has not committed to run for leader. There's been some chatter about Steve Daines, Republican from Montana to say nothing of the kind of declared candidates here, John Thune, the whip and John Corden, the former whip. So that's the factor that might be making this more troublesome on the minibus here, the first minibus in the Senate, compared to if they try to do the second one, because the McConnell factor has changed. The tectonic plates have shifted a bit in the Senate, Jared. Let me finish with this and it's a state of the union question. How was your reunion with expelled congressmen and I guess now congressional candidate George Santos? What was the reaction from his former colleagues? Well, I was shocked. I was cutting through a tunnel here at the Capitol going downstairs not long before the speech and here he came and on one hand, I was very surprised to see him and on another, I was not because he's George Santos and people said, well, how can he come back? Well, we've only expelled six house members in history, six and three of them were around the time of the Civil War. One in 1980s, one about 22 years ago now, Jim Traffkin from Ohio. Traffkin's dead, Ozzy Myers and Pennsylvania, he's still around, actually had legal issues again in his 80s just last year. So it's kind of uncharted territory about what you do with an expelled member. These Confederate members, they expelled back during the Civil War, they ain't around anymore. So George Santos had barely been a member, not even a year, but former members have the ability to have floor privileges to come into the building. They have that, you know, all their life. And so if you've retired or you've quit or whatever, you just didn't run for reelection or you were defeated, you can come back into the building and regularly you see people, especially around big events. I saw Mike Ross, who is a former Democratic representative from Arkansas the other day up here for state of the Union. You know, there were a couple other four because they came in for the speech or they have other business or they just come to say hi. So Santos, this was a little bit different coming into the building. He was definitely here to troll his colleagues. The fact that he could do it and do it on a big stage, state of the Union, command some news, oxygen, we're talking about it. You know, announced during the speech that he was going to run against Nick Lolo, the Republican representative from Long Island, a different discipline. Who was one of those that voted to oust him? Absolutely. And was one of the most fervent persons wanting to get him out. Absolutely. This was a troll job by Santos of the tallest order. Well, it's always interesting to be on Capitol Hill. Maybe no more so than on days where there is a state of the Union to be delivered. So Chad, appreciate the long hours this week. Get some rest this weekend. We'll talk soon, my friend. My pleasure. Thank you. We'll talk about that with the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors Jared Bernstein and Super Tuesday, all but sealed a 2020 election rematch after near sweeps in the primaries by President Biden and former President Trump.

I'm Greg Jarrett. I'm Sandra Smith. Wednesday, March 20th, 2024. I'm Jessica Rosenthal. The focus has been on the felonies the former president has charged with, but now his focus is on finding cash. As New York's top prosecutor, threatens to go after Trump's assets in a civil case. The analogy is a judge ordering the taking of your home, but in order to appeal the judgment, you have to sell the home. I'm Dave Anthony. TikTok users and influencers keep pushing back on Congress's potential TikTok ban over the social media apps links to China. The same guys that are up there spouting off that it's all about national security also allowed the weather balloons to fly all over the United States without anything. They allow our open borders on the southern border of people to just flood in by the thousands down there with no checks and balances there. And I'm Janice Dean. After voting in Palm Beach, Florida Tuesday with Melania by his side, former president Trump addressed the more than $450 million civil penalty against him that increases every day, by the way. As his attorneys say they can't post bond on that amount. Manhattan judge Arthur Engoron levelled that hefty fine after finding the former president overvalued his properties in an effort to get better loans and insurance policies. Billions of dollars in value, millions of dollars in properties, but they'd like to take the cash away so I can't use it on the campaign. And this is just a corrupt group of people. It's election interference and we'll see how the courts rule on it. In order for the former president to appeal the fine, he has to first post bond basically ensuring that he has the cash on hand should he lose the appeal. His attorneys say 30 shurdy companies won't post more than $100 million as bond. And they will not accept his real estate as collateral. Trump's attorneys wrote in the court filing this quote, obtaining such cash the way fire sale of real estate holdings would inevitably result in massive irrecoverable losses. Textbook error, prepable injury. Well, if Mr. Trump doesn't meet the deadline on Monday, attorney general, attisha james, who brought the case, could potentially freeze his bank accounts and then even go after some of his real estate properties like the iconic Trump tower to satisfy the judgment. Now attorney general, attisha james campaigned on prosecuting Trump for something. Here she was at the Cooper Union School in July of 2018. Yes, we need to focus on Donald Trump and his abuses. We need to follow his money. We need to find out where he's laundered money. We need to find out whether or not he's engaged in conspiracy. As the former president looks to appeal this fine, some legal analysts say the incredibly high penalty amount may be a due process violation. But he hasn't on Monday or james says she may begin trying to take his assets. What is different here is the astronomical size of the penalty imposed by the New York court. Many of us believe that the almost half a billion dollars in penalty is excessive and unconnected to any objective basis of losses or victims. So it creates a rather perverse incentive for a court that you can just pick almost randomly some massive number and make it very difficult for anyone to review your decision. I mean, this the analogy is a judge ordering the taking of your home, but in order to appeal the judgment, you have to sell the home. It gets to the point where you're interfering with the ability of someone to get a palette review. This is a case that is screaming out for palette review. Many of us cannot imagine how this level of penalty could ever be upheld. What the bond issue does is it front loads the main issue in the case. There's general acceptance that a company or an individual can be fined for this type of allegation. There is evidence that Donald Trump overvalued or undervalued assets. The concern many of us have is that that is a ubiquitous practice in New York real estate. I mean, it is I've talked to business people in New York who are dumbfounded by this lawsuit because it is very common for companies to overvalue their assets. That's why these estimates came as with the Trump estimate with a warning that you shouldn't rely on this and do your own research. The New York Attorney General has said, if you can't pay this, I'm going after your real estate assets. I mean, there's this image, I think, for many of us that Trump loses Trump tower and his real estate empire. Is that possible even if it is a slow process? No, I think the dramatic scene of being locked out of the Trump tower is not likely to unfold. First of all, Trump does not necessarily own all the assets in these real estate ventures. He has leveraged those properties and has partners on properties that also have claims. But also this takes a while. You have to seek authority to essentially confiscate property and then there could be further challenges to how you do that. The eagerness of James to start that process is a little bit telling. I mean, this is an attorney general who ran on the pledge to bag Trump without ever saying what she would prosecute him for. That's literally campaigning on a pledge of selective prosecution, something that is a nathema to the rule of law. But putting aside her eagerness, she will have to go through a process to actually confiscate property. Since these assets are not entirely owned by Donald Trump, there will be other companies and individuals who have a right to access and use of the property. The question for Trump is technical to some extent, but also common sense in another. These companies are not willing to take real estate as the collateral for the bond. Trump is in a very difficult position because of the nature of his business. There's a reasonable aspect to that. Objection, if he were 3M, then he could fork over the money, but he's not. He's someone who has spent his entire life with assets in real estate. Is that something and appeals judge could weigh? They can, on the question of selective prosecution. The problem is that selective prosecution is very difficult to prove. Judges truly despise these motions. I have brought a couple of them. They don't want to be pulled into motivations of a prosecutor. Now, very few prosecutors are as raw and open as Leticia James. It's a disgrace to run on a pledge of selective prosecution. And also consider if you're a bank or bonding company, you have an attorney general who's laying waste to political opponents, who's pursuing people like Trump with unrelenting vigor. Do you really want to get in the crosshairs of an attorney general like that? That's the problem. And so I think New York is eviscerating its standing as a legal system. And I expect that there's going to be a greater exodus from the city due to this case. Well, just so we understand, I feel it's strange to be talking about a bond on a civil penalty. I don't think I've personally ever talked about that. I think we're used to using the words bond on criminal cases. Like we use bail. Why does he need to post, quote unquote, post bond here? Well, the theory is that after a trial, a prevailing party should not have to go through a appeal unless there is a guarantee that you are prepared as the losing party to pay up if you should not prevail. And the idea is that the other party has prevailed, has proven the case on the trial level. And so you can appeal, but you need to pony up to show that you're prepared to make good on that commitment. I've always been rather skeptical of these rules. I do believe that they can constitute a barrier to do process. But I have never, even though I've been a critic of that for years, I've never seen the likes of this. I mean, this is breathtaking that a judge would arbitrarily come up with this massive number, knowing that it would be very hard to allow any judge to look at his ruling unless the accused party sells off assets. And you know, this was a judge who was asked, I think reasonably by Trump and his team, to waive this bond requirement. He could have done that. So, Ingram could have just shown that he was not this hostile jurist. He could have shown that he had a certain degree of balance and circumspection. He didn't. He refused to make any changes at all in the bond obligation. He also opposed an astronomical interest of 9% annually plus added costs. All of that is rather confiscatory. And I think it does really raise a due process question under the Constitution. There's been a lot of movement in the Fulton County, Georgia case with the special prosecutor stepping down over the impropriety or the seemingly impropriety of their relationship with the DA. There's hushed money case out of Manhattan. Obviously, there's delay in the federal January 6 case. When you look at sort of, I guess, all of what's happening in Trump world on the legal dockets, just your gut reaction to how it all impacts the campaign in light of this new issue of needing to find money. Well, first of all, there is still a chance that Trump could be in trial before the election that has certainly dwindled in some of these cases, but there's still a chance one of these torpedoes will hit before the election. But the optics on that are having a rather curious impact on the election. Most of the public gets it. I mean, you don't have to light Donald Trump to look at these cases and have real reservations about what's happening in our legal system. These are politically motivated cases. The cases in New York are raw in political. Elvin Bragg is a broad case that none of us have seen the like of. He's essentially trying to make a misdemeanor under state law into a felony by charging a crime that the Department of Justice refused to prosecute. He's bootstrapping a federal offense into a state case. It's ridiculous in the case of Fahni Willis, the case that she's brought in in Atlanta. She has a racketeering theory that is so thin. It's virtually transparent. The connection between any of these 19 parties is so attenuated that it's going to have great difficulty in being upheld on appeal. But with all this pylon in all these different states, the public is reacting. Every indictment has produced better polling results for Trump. And there's a reason for that. The American people don't like it. They like illegal their legal system. They believe in blind justice. This is not it. And they know it. But when they see it, when they see select a prosecution, it's pretty obvious. Professor Johnathan Terrily, thank you so much for your insight. Appreciate it. Thank you. But beneath the surface operated a sinister and depraved sex cult. India Oxenberg was trapped and exploited by Keith Reineri and Nexium for seven years. In 2018, she broke free. Will the Senate join the House approving a bill that could ultimately ban a social media app? TikTok certainly is a dangerous tool in the hands of an adversary. People are understanding that China is an adversary. The ransomware, the attacks, the hacking that they do into our economy, the military buildup they do. A majority of Republicans and Democrats support the bill and President Biden says he would sign it. He would force TikTok to separate itself from bite dance or else be banned. A mid-concerned China is vacuuming up user data for surveillance, which TikTok denies. The company also says it is not owned by China and would not allow Chinese influence of content. TikTok users are angry at Congress. The potential ban would affect about 170 million Americans, including a couple of Texas ranchers turned TikTok influencers. All right, we're doing a Valentine series and the first day we're doing how we met. We always get this question. Okay, no go ahead. You always have to stop. Cody stalk me at the bank. That is not what happened. You did. I was working at the bank and he stalked me. That is not what happened. You saw my bank account in last time like a piranha. You came after me. Cody and Erica Archie have 1.2 million followers. You know, we never set out to do this. This was never in the plan in our heads. Now, the Archies have full-time jobs and run the bar seven ranch in Gatesville, Texas now famous after they were featured in a TikTok sparks good commercial. We had been on other platforms before just trying to tell our story of agriculture so that we could always have that story out there and make sure people knew where their food and their fiber came from and be transparent and genuine. Then one day we were on the way to feed some cows and we made a funny video and posted it on TikTok. Finally, we burst it out of that little bubble of family and friends that we had been in for so long and went viral on TikTok. Finally, got to share our story with millions of people across the world. What's that moment like, Cody, when suddenly you realize, holy moly, a lot of people are watching this. Well, that first video had like 15,000 views and I thought, well, now that I'm the king of TikTok and I've gone viral, which isn't even viral, you know, having 15,000 views. But you know, it's kind of humbling because you don't really think that people have an interest in your day-to-day life, but we've grown a huge community across this platform and many other platforms and just it's almost like we have family scattered all over the world now. So what is it that you have grown into becoming with TikTok and these other platforms? How do you influence? What do you put out there? We try every day to just put out educational content, just content that shows people how we live our lives, not just as ranchers, but as entrepreneurs, as just a family and put out just genuine content of what we're doing every day out here. Yeah, so we'll usually try to mix in one or two educational deals about like, you know, the kind of feed we're feeding or why we're doing something with the livestock that we have, why our son homeschools and just kind of debunking some of those myths and then we also mix in just some humor, just Eric and I's banter back and forth as a couple of 18 years of marriage and you know, we just mix all that stuff in and have a good time with it and people seem to enjoy it. They seem to be able to relate to it because it's it's real world experiences that we go through. We don't do the the trends. We don't do the dances and all that kind of stuff. So we've had a great experience with TikTok sharing and growing our community, but also we get to share our faith with with the world ever sunday. We do a capsule sermon. We'll do the week of Easter. We'll talk about what Christ was going through the end. We do an advent reading for the first 24 days of the month in December for Christmas and we just get to share the gospel there and and it's really just allowed us to reach a lot of folks. Has anyone ever asked you to modify your content or asked you to post something in particular from TikTok? Has TikTok ever gotten involved in anything you've done? TikTok has never asked us say, Hey, post this. Hey, will you do this? Hey, we do that. We did the commercial, the you know, TikTok sparks good campaign, but other than that, no, we don't we don't get paid by TikTok to produce content for TikTok. Now we do earn an income based on the views that our normal videos get, but that's I guess comes from some advertiser or something that paid the platform. I don't really know where that money comes from. Gotcha. Okay. Now how do a lot of there's other businesses that make money on TikTok? Is that how all monies made on TikTok? Are there varieties of ways to make money using the platform? There are varieties of ways, mostly to get paid from TikTok, you're going to get paid on views and comments and engagement and things like that, but then you could also get paid for brand deals that you make with certain brands reaching out to you and things like that. The create content for them, but they pay you directly or pay you in product. There are a lot of influencers and a lot of small businesses across the nation that earn money off of what's called TikTok shop. It's where they can sell their goods and services directly to the consumer using their own advertising ads, their own space on TikTok. So for you guys, TikTok has been great, right? In every way. Yep. Other than the ill informed that say we're supporters of the Chinese Communist Party and we should move to China and fly Chinese flag, but for the most part, yeah, I mean, obviously, obviously there are probably some people listening to think your brainwashed or something like that, but I want you to listen to the arguments for a ban, certainly for what Congress wants to have happened to TikTok. Now, obviously the FBI director has said that there's a threat with TikTok with Chinese influence. Congressmen might galagre, a public and is very much outspoken about Chinese influence in the US. He's worried about the manipulation of content. I want to you listen to the congressman. TikTok isn't just an app for funny dance videos. It is increasingly a new source for Americans under the age of 30 and allowing a CCP-controlled entity like TikTok to become the dominant media player in America would be like if in 1962 at the height of the Cold War right before the Cuban Missile Crisis, we'd allowed Provda and the KGB to purchase the New York Times, the Washington Post, ABC and NBC. So when you hear something like that, Cody and Erica, what do you think? The same guys that are up there spouting off that it's all about national security, also allowed the weather balloons to fly all over the United States without anything. They allow our open borders on the southern border people to just flood in by the thousands down there with no no checks and balances there. And when you take a look at it, what really got me thinking about this is it's really all about money. He's right. There is a lot of people that use this as a source of news and they don't have the control meaning Congress and the powers that be up there to manipulate what we're getting to see. When you go on there and post something, it goes up and that's just the way it is. It's not like it's Facebook or Instagram where it's shielding thoughts from other people and stuff they don't want you to see. Facebook is down because of TikTok, Amazon Marketplaces down because of TikTok shop. Does that make you think that there's something going on if those two guys are wanting to buy it as soon as it's up for sale? You know former president Trump has said that if there was a ban on TikTok, it would actually benefit Facebook, which he calls the true enemy of the people. Do you think Facebook or Instagram, you think they're worse than TikTok? I don't know about worse, but they all have problems. They all have faults. The difference is is this one in control by Silicon Valley and Washington. They don't have control over it, so it's public enemy number one. When there's far greater problems in the United States that we're facing right now that we need to be worrying about besides, what national secret are they going to steal from bar seven ranch? And the other thing is it's a voluntary app. If you choose to get on it, if you're worried that they're going to steal all your national security stuff, number one, there shouldn't be any social media apps on any government phone, any business phone in my opinion. If I provided phones from my employees, they would not be able to download any app because they're all spying on us. If we talk about butter dishes today, it's going to pop up on your phone when you look at your phone later this afternoon, whether you go to Google Amazon, Facebook, whatever it is, you're going to see an ad for butter dishes. Yeah, no, I understand. If the bill does pass the Senate and TikToks on the clock to have to get rid of its Chinese ownership, do you think that there will be a ban? What will you guys do? Just worry about your other accounts? Yes, I mean, we never saw ourselves being influencers. This just happened by chance and try the grace of God really. And we don't depend on any of the income that we earn off a TikTok to support our family. And the way we budget for our family, that's just extra. It goes over into a different account. But it's saying that, unfortunately, there are millions of people that it will deeply affect, that have relied on that income and rely on TikToks shop and things like that to generate their business. A lot of people look at TikTok and social media as all it is, it's just young kids dancing and singing and doing stuff like that. But there are five million small businesses that are earning income there that is taxable income that goes to fund US tax money. It gets taxed just like your regular job. And there are a lot of people that said, hey, they have learned over the last couple of years, I can make more money selling t-shirts that I print in my backyard, in my garage, on TikTok, then I ever could work in an eight to five job. It must be fun, though, to put the videos out and have the community that you have and the reaction to different videos and getting to know people that would never have known you at bar seven in Gatesville, Texas. Absolutely. That's what we love best is we wouldn't do it. People ask us all the time, you know, isn't this time consuming? Doesn't this get old? And we would not do it if we weren't still having fun every day. And we just, it's not a job to us because we've truly just video parts of our lives every single day and put out, you know, what's happening here and share it with the people that are out there. And we get tons of comments and direct messages, private messages every day that are encouraging to keep sharing our journey. All right. Since you both liked to put pieces of advice on your on your TikTok channel, what would you tell someone who asks, how do I go viral? Man, there is no, there is no formula for that because we'll create something and we're like, man, this is going to be a hit. And it just maybe doesn't go anywhere. And then you do something, it's just like, we're just going to throw this up there because we don't have anything else to put up right now. We had, you know, got our phones out when we were doing something. And you know, we're just going to put it up there for filler and it takes off. It's really, it really just depends on what the people that are on right then are watching and what they find amusing or interesting. There really is no formula for it that we found. But the advice I always tell people is just do it. Just post just video things that happen in your life and what you're interested in and what you would want to continue to video every day and make content about and see what happens because you never know what's going to happen. It seems like that like anything with an animal and it will usually get a lot of views. So if you have a good place to start. All right. Well, Cody and Erica Archie ranchers at bar seven ranch in Gatesville, Texas influencers on TikTok. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having us. And in other news, I'm Gianna Jalosi. If you have a couple hundred thousand dollars, that's just burning a hole in your pocket. I have an idea for you. A Michelin star meal in space. Space VIP is one of the first luxury space tourism companies and it's hosting an immersive dining experience in space with Michelin star Dana chef Rasmus Monk. Six people will quote be making history by enjoying a meal of a lifetime above 99% of Earth's atmosphere during a six hour journey. For a cool $495,000 per ticket, the chef is going to whip up the meal aboard the space perspective spaceship Neptune. The mission is set to launch in late 2025 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It's not a rocket, but a pressurized capsule propelled by a space balloon. Travelers are going to get to watch the sunrise a hundred thousand feet above sea level. The actual menu though has yet to be finalized, but all proceeds are going to benefit the space prize foundation, which promotes gender equity in science and tech. I'm Dana Perino, co-host of the Five and co-anchor of America's newsroom. Join me for my brand new podcast Perino on Politics. Every Monday, I'm going to talk to people I trust in politics. Whether you like it or not, a presidential rematch is underway. This week, sub-stacker and founder of Melmond Consulting, Bruce Melmond joins me with his analysis of this very familiar election. For Maureen Flavin-Sweeney, it was her weather report that helped win a world war. Maureen grew up in the southern part of County Kerry, Ireland. At the age of 18, she took a job as a post office assistant in Blacksawd. According to the Irish independent, Blacksawd was the first land-based observation station in Europe, where weather readings could be professionally taken on the prevailing European Atlantic-Western weather systems. During World War II, the Republic of Ireland was neutral, but it did allow the sharing of weather information with Great Britain. Maureen spent quite a bit of her time writing down the atmospheric conditions. She really didn't understand what for, but she was diligent about her work and getting it right. It was on her 21st birthday on June 3, 1944 at 1am that Maureen was making her report. One crucial instrument that has been used to study the weather since the 1600s is a barometer. It measures the atmospheric pressure which gives us clues about the conditions we're going to experience. On that morning, Maureen's research was showing that the air pressure was dropping rapidly. That meant there was something out there in the Atlantic, a nasty storm that would hit the Irish coast, move over the UK, then down over the channel into Normandy, France. Miss Flavin compiled the weather conditions and then sent it to Dublin. What she didn't know at the time was that the information was then forwarded to Dunstable, England, where the meteorological headquarters were stationed. Captain James Martin Stagg, the chief meteorologist for US General Dwight D Eisenhower, was helping plan the Allied invasion. Stagg and his staff saw what Maureen was sending them, a drop in the barometric pressure indicating a strong area of low pressure. The Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force was forwarded her weather reports, which were then checked and double checked. General Eisenhower decided to postpone D-Day by one day, so instead of going ahead on the 5th, the invasion took place on June 6th. Maureen had no idea of the gravity of her reporting. If it weren't for the accurate prediction, Allied forces would have gone ahead on the 5th of June and the invasion would have been a disaster. It wasn't until decades later that Maureen realized how crucial her observations were. Maureen was honored in a ceremony in June of 2021, marking the 77th anniversary of D-Day, and the role she played in helping change the course of the invasion. Her name is now listed in the US Congressional Record for the now famous weather report she delivered, that ultimately saved countless lives. Maureen Flavin-Sweeney was 100 years old when she died December 17th, 2023, in a nursing home in Belmullet, Ireland, very close to the post office, where she used to work. There is no doubt in my mind that one person can make a difference. The trajectory of history was changed forever because of one woman's hard work, determination, diligence, and a precise weather report she delivered. And that deserves to be celebrated and shared.

They're ordering TikTok's parent company to divest of TikTok or be banned in the United States. Many, many of those people use that application don't realize just how exposed their data is. And that was something we've been trying to address for a long time and this still finally really goes to the heart of that. I'm Dave Anthony. Israel's military is getting ready to go into Rafa. Something the US warns could not only kill a lot of Palestinian civilians. It may not succeed. A mass fighters can escape to other parts of Gaza, where Israeli forces have now withdrawn. And so it creates a scenario of a cat and mouse chase that the Israelis will never be able to complete. And I'm Tommy Laren. 50 to zero. That was the vote out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in favor of legislation that says bite dance, which is based in Beijing, China must divest from TikTok or face a ban here in the US. The Chinese Communist Party has no first amendment right to control TikTok. Any more than the Soviet Union had a first amendment right to control ABC and NBC and CBS during the Cold War. As many of you know, TikTok is not merely a social media platform. It is the leading news source for the next generation and the fact that we're putting the leading news source for the most impressionable minds in our society. In the hands of our leading foreign adversary is an act of self sabotage. Democratic Congressman Richie Torres stood alongside Republicans and Democrats who approved the bill. And as a New Yorker who lives through 9-11, I never thought in my wildest nightmares that I would see Osama bin Laden's letter to America trending on TikTok. So if that is not enough of a provocation to effectuate a forced sale of TikTok, I'm not sure what would be. So I'm honored to support this bill. The Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment in the US said last year that bite dance needed to divest that the administration didn't do anything. Ask late last week what he would do if the bill made it through the Senate. President Biden said, last year TikTok's CEO, show two, testified before Congress. And he was met with lawmaker after lawmaker who said they did not believe him when he told them China hadn't asked for any American data and they wouldn't give it over even if the Chinese government had asked. Florida Republican Congressman Neil Dunn has bite dance spied on American citizens. I don't think the spying is the right way to describe it. This is ultimately we can Monday, main independent senator Angus King asked FBI director Christopher Bray during the worldwide threats hearing what the problems are with TikTok. The first is the data, the second is the algorithm, the third is the software. But the problem is not TikTok. It's the control by China. If TikTok were divested and owned by an American company or a Belgian company or a British company, we wouldn't have this level of problems. That correct? Correct. So how did this many Democrats and Republicans come to agree on this matter? Fifty to nothing vote doesn't happen overnight. In fact, it's a month of work behind the scenes. Steve Scalice is the House Majority Leader, Anna Louisiana Republican Congressman. Not only members of the Energy and Commerce Committee led by chair Captain McMorris Rodgers. But really if you go back to the China Task Force that we've set up last year, and Mike Gallagher has led that effort, he and his committee have been working on a number of things to confront China and the threats that they pose both militarily, economically, and from a data standpoint. And so they made a number of recommendations months ago to the other standing committees. And this was one of those recommendations. And so ultimately, chair McGalagher started working with Captain McMorris Rodgers and her members and they built a bipartisan coalition and it led to a 50 to nothing vote. That you're right. Some people off guard, but for those of us who had been working behind the scenes for months to put this together to confront the threat that China poses, especially to the data of our young people that is all being exposed and invulnerable to the Chinese Communist Party. This has really been a win for people to care about data privacy and standing up to China. And just goes to show when lawmakers want to get something done. They actually can be like lightning quick about it. Although what you're saying is it wasn't lightning quick at all. We've been working on it for a while. But this bill says bite dance. You're in Beijing so you have to divest of TikTok. So be owned by another company. Of like a forced sale. We'll make sure Apple and Google can't host you, right? Right. Taking shelter in American company and continue to go forward. So the idea that it's a ban is not accurate because it just says that the Chinese Communist Party can't have access to this data. So any company that's owned by China, the CCP can literally go and get access to the information from that company. So bite dance is the Chinese owned company. And that means that the data that's controlled, which by the way, it's a massive amounts of data that TikTok has. On over 170 million people across America, byometric data, a lot of personal data. And I'm sure most users of that application don't realize how vulnerable and exposed their personal data is to the Chinese Communist Party. This bill takes care of that. Tell me about order of concern because it sounds like Senator Angus King and Christopher Wei went back and forth Monday at the worldwide threats hearing about what exactly the concern was. And it's yes, it's the vast amount of information. It's also the algorithm. But chief, the chief concern is not necessarily those things. It's that China isn't control of it. So if another company had that much data of ours, it might be concerning, but it's not China level concerning. Yeah, and it really, if you look at the bill, addresses four different countries, you know, China being the most obvious. But also Russia, Iran and North Korea. So any of those four countries, that are national security threats. But here in the case of TikTok, you know, that's the one that most people recognize. And again, it's so widely used by so many people across this country. Many, many of those people use that application don't realize just how exposed their data is. And that was something we've been trying to address for a long time. And this still finally really goes to the heart of that. Okay, so the president says he will sign it if it gets through the Senate. I guess that's not a sure thing. Rand Paul has said banning things based on not liking countries or governments isn't a good idea. Even Lindsey Graham said maybe it's, I think of his words where maybe it's like necessary to protect Americans. But if you could avoid a ban, and I know you're saying this isn't a ban necessarily, but he's saying this level, whatever this is, it'd be a good idea to avoid this. Will it get through the Senate, though? I think in the end, they're strong. And I've heard already from a number of senators who were very interested in seeing the spill pass the Senate. So, you know, they're going to have their opportunity. We're going to take up the bill Wednesday in the House War. And I think you're going to see a good robust debate and a strong vote. But ultimately, that's going to be up to the Senate. I hope they take it up, have the same kind of debate about this. Understand what the bill does, like I mentioned earlier. They had to talk to us. They said it has to be divested to an American owner because of the national security threat posed by what they're doing with your data. And there's a lot of interest on a broader scale of protecting the data of Americans for any kind of application. But we've also got a real concern about how a lot of these software developers and whether it's you know, the big tech companies, you know, Facebook, Google all of them, how they discriminate in their algorithms. This bill doesn't get even into that. It's really more the access to the data that the Chinese Communist Party has. That we're addressing with this bill. You know, the algorithm issue in general is another debate. The Sallulon must confront that when he purchased what was then, not with when he purchased Twitter. Twitter and finally, you know, renamed it X. It was about turning it back into a free speech platform. And every and he by the way exposed just how much discrimination was going on against conservative. And how much of that still goes on by companies like Facebook and Google and others. It's is a concern that we're going to continue to hammer away at. This is more the direct national security threat that is posed by by dancers access to all of that data that they have right now. Okay, but TikTok says they may take legal action if this gets that far. And a federal judge did block Montana's TikTok ban. They, I guess the judge accused the state of not protecting consumers, but of targeting China. Could a law from Congress survive like the First Amendment legal scrutiny with the national security argument in a way that maybe a lone state couldn't? Yeah, no chairman Gallagher and Chair Kathy M. Morris Rodgers and all the members of Congress who worked on this bill work with constitutional lawyers and scholars to address that very issue. Because clearly it will be challenged legally. You would expect by dance to try to go to the courts to block it. And you know, all the constitutional experts that we worked with said we absolutely have the legal ability to do this. But of course it would take an act of Congress and you know, the whole saying goes. And so that means the bill would have to pass the House and Senate and be signed by the president for this ability to occur. Congressman, just a couple more for you. What do you tell young people who absolutely love TikTok, but are deeply upset by this, some of them because they have businesses and their livelihoods are at this point based on their TikTok following. Would they have a case? I know some of them were involved in the Montana challenge. What do you tell people? A number of things, one, under the bill, by dance can still sell to an American company. And I'm sure will. And that means TikTok can still go forward as the application that people use. What's at stake here and I think what most young people or anybody who uses TikTok would be surprised to learn is just how vulnerable their personal data is. You know, there was a case a few years ago where there were some back to allude polls in the application that were allowing TikTok to go into other applications on your phone and get data from things like your contacts, which even if you didn't authorize them to have access to that information, they were able to do it. That alarmed a lot of people rightfully. So I think if people knew just how vulnerable their personal data was that is on TikTok and accessible by the Chinese Communist Party, they probably have some reservations about all the things that they've uploaded to the application already. That would be protected if this bill passes and then ultimately you see the debastor to where they sell to an American company where no longer would those threats of your data being sent over to the CCP of the ballot. I know there's some interest already. I think Mr. Wonderful said he'd like to buy it. So what do you make though of former President Trump sounding like, now he does not want to TikTok pan. We remember when he did and again, I apologize and I know you're saying this is not a TikTok. It's really a ban on the Chinese on a Chinese company owning TikTok. But he is former President Trump is saying no to this that it'll make Metas, Yomark Zuckerberg more powerful. What do you make of this? Well, he turned around. Yeah, what he was concerned about, he's not against the bill when he said if he doesn't want to make like he said Facebook, it companies like that more powerful that discriminated against insurgitives. This bill doesn't do that. Like I mentioned, in fact, it would facilitate a sale to an American company which would make, in my view, TikTok more powerful because there are a lot of parents including myself who don't allow their children to download TikTok right now because of the threats to your personal data to the CCP that once that's removed, once it's an American own company that won't have those reservations anymore and I think you'd see more people using TikTok. So it would make the application more powerful and as you brought up, when Donald Trump was President, he was involved in trying to help facilitate a sale. I know Microsoft was one of the companies that was trying to buy TikTok. And there were some lawsuits involved back then, but there was no legal, there was no law on the books that required this to happen. And so this gets us closer to that point and as you could tell from when Donald Trump was President, there were definitely American companies interested in buying TikTok back then. So the idea that it would go away, I don't think is realistic. It's just, the CCP just wouldn't have access to your personal data, which is a good thing. Congressman Steve Scolis, we hope you're doing well and thanks so much for joining us. Absolutely, it's great to be with you. Thanks, Jessica. Former federal prosecutor and four-term U.S. Congressman from South Carolina brings you a one-of-a-kind podcast. podcast and leave me a rating and review. Victory is at hand. Victory is close. Hamas will reconstitute itself with these four battalions in Rafa, reconquer the Gaza Strip and do the October 7th massacre over and over and over again. Of course, that terror attack triggered the war, but President Biden says in Israeli operation in Rafa crosses a red line warning that Netanyahu could hurt Israel more than help it. To the extent that the world thinks that America and Israel are united, that helps the war effort and it helps our effort to achieve victory. Obviously, the release of the hostages to the extent that Hamas believes that there's daylight between us. That doesn't help. Despite the US opposition to Rafa offensive, though, the President told MSNBC Saturday night. The defensive Israel is still critical. So there's no red line. I'm going to cut off all weapons so they don't have the iron dome to protect them. They don't have, but there's red lines that if he crosses and they cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians. The concern is that more than a million civilians are in Rafa. After fleeing fighting in other areas and further complicating things, the Holy Muslim month of Ramadan has begun. Rafa is really the only area of Gaza that has been untouched by the Israeli ground campaign. Trayyanks, Tizafox News 4 in Correspond, the news that a front rose seat to the war in Tel Aviv, Israel. It's where Israeli officials say that Hamas leadership, including top officials like Yakh Hastinwar and Muhammad Def, are hiding. They also believe that the hostages that were taken into Gaza on October 7th, those who remain 134 people are being held in that southern most city. The Americans are telling the Israelis don't go in. Look for a diplomatic solution. Trayy, there is no diplomatic solution. We had one ceasefire. There were hostages freed, some Palestinian prisoners freed, the fighting stopped for a while, but they can't seem to work that out again. This was sort of used as a backstop in the conversations that were taking place that a deal would have to get together before the start of Ramadan. Well, Ramadan is underway. There's no deal in place. And it appears that the diplomatic efforts are falling apart. You even have Israel's intelligence agencies like the Mossad putting out statements, very rare statements because they are normally quite private in their operations saying that Hamas is not interested in a ceasefire. They're not interested in a hostage deal. They would like to ignite the region during Ramadan. And so the Israelis are making a calculation of their own saying that it makes sense to put military pressure because from their view, they believe it has worked so far in the campaign against Hamas inside Gaza. And the Americans are, in part, rightly noting that there is no way to completely destroy Hamas in the strip. Even if they enter the southernmost city of Rafa, it will be too dangerous to enter the tunnel network beneath the city because that's where the hostages are believed to be held. And they could be killed if an operation like that were to take place. And even if they are successful in wiping out the Hamas battalions that still exist in estimated four above ground, Hamas fighters can escape to other parts of Gaza, where Israeli forces have now withdrawn. And so it creates a scenario of a cat and mouse chase that the Israelis will never be able to complete. And the Americans are telling them, slow things down, work to continue efforts on the diplomatic front and don't go into Rafa. The 30,000 deaths that the health minister in Gaza says have taken place during this war. How many of them are militants, slash terrorists, and how many of them are civilians? Do we have a good breakdown of this? We don't have a good breakdown. Both sides are using different numbers, and there is simply no way to confirm exactly how many people have been killed. The Palestinian-run health ministry that is overseen traditionally by Hamas, but at this point really isn't overseen by anyone because all social services have broken down inside the strip. It is chaos amid this war inside Gaza. They say around 30,000 people have been killed, and they do not make a distinction between Hamas, militants, and civilians. With that said, we know that thousands of civilians have been killed, this includes non-combatants, women, children, innocent people. Among that number, whatever the number is, there are also thousands of Hamas fighters that are waging an active conflict against Israeli forces that are operating inside Gaza. Now on the flip side, the Israelis say that the death toll right now is a ratio of around one to one. They say for every militant that has been killed, and they estimate around 13,000 of them have been killed, that one civilian died in the process. That is probably underselling the reality on the ground, the destruction as we've seen with our own eyes, and our cameras have captured when we've entered the Gaza strip with the military, is widespread. It's catastrophic. You can smell the bodies under the rubble. They have no way of really confirming the exact number of people killed, and to go one step further, at this point they have no way to even confirm the specific identities of the militants that they have gone after. They went after the number three person in Hamas over the weekend, and we understand that according to Israeli media, they've not yet been able to confirm if the strikes actually killed this man, Marwan Issa, because they can't get into the tunnel, into the rubble where they were striking. You spoke about Ramadan. What is it traditionally? How do Muslims typically observe it, and what would it be like now for them in Gaza to do it? So for Palestinians in Gaza, this is a very sad Ramadan. It's a Ramadan where they are mourning rather than celebrating. That is not just the sentiment inside the strip. It's also in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem where traditionally there would be lights and a celebratory mood. This year it's not like that, and there is concern that as we've seen in the past, when Friday Prayer takes place, that it will erupt into violence between Israeli security forces that operate in East Jerusalem at the Al-Aksamaq's compound, and Muslim worshippers that are gathered there. We have been there in the old city when these clashes erupt, and they often start out small, and they lead to a broader spark, which in the past has led to rocket fire from Gaza. Now, the majority of the rocket infrastructure has been destroyed, and while you may see rockets here or there, the ability for factions like Hamas and Islam to target major population centers has diminished greatly since the war began. There are also other threats, though, against Israel, from places like Yemen, with Iran-backed Houthi rebels, along the northern border where we see continuous fire. Each and every day, rockets and drones being launched by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and then of course Iran-backed Iraqi and Syrian Shia militias. Now, I know during Ramadan, there is a fast from dawn to dusk, then there would be a feast, but there's no feasting in Gaza, right? I mean, a lot of people, if they get a meal a day, they're probably fortunate. Is that right? Correct. And we've seen a few images from the southernmost city of Rafa, and Palestinians are trying to make do with what they have, some canned goods that they were able to get from aid trucks, or from some of the very, very small markets that are still operating in the southern part of the strip. In the north, many people are relying on the few trucks, sometimes less than a dozen a day that are able to make it in recent days to the northern part of the strip. And then of course, these air drops that the Americans have been participating in, where they're actually dropping MREs to the Palestinian civilians that are in desperate need of aid. And so, like you've noted, traditionally, there would be large feasts for the Palestinian people. In the past, we've been there actually during Ramadan, reporting in Gaza, and they would have things like chicken and lamb and rice. This year, they have whatever they can to survive and get by. But yet still, given how devout most of the Gaza population is, they will participate in the fast, and they will break the fast, even if they only have small bits of food to do it with. The UN has been warning from months, the humanitarian crisis keeps getting worse. For Palestinian civilians with so many hungry, it's almost a famine now in Gaza. Officials there claim at least 20 children have died of malnutrition or dehydration. And getting aid in has been difficult at times. So, President Biden said in last week's State of the Union address, I'm directing the US military to lead an emergency mission, to establish a temporary peer in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments, kind of food, water, medicine, and temporary shelter. So, when would that be ready? We don't know the exact timeline. And already, the information about it is starting to trickle in, there are reports that indicate a thousand American forces will participate in the broader efforts to get this together. And so, they will do so with, according to reports, the security assurance of the Israelis. And so, this will be a peer that will allow ships to come from Cyprus after receiving a security screening and drop off aid at what has been described as a floating dock to get to the Palestinians in the northern part of the strip. And the hope here is that it will alleviate the pressure of these trucks to get from the south of Gaza to the north, knowing that a lot of the infrastructure in the roads have been destroyed inside Gaza amid the past five months of war. Is that accurate? And there is a lot of frustration in the way that this conflict has been handled in the intelligence failures that led to the October 7th massacre. And there are also calls from the families of those being held hostage in Gaza to implement a ceasefire agreement at all costs. And so, he has support to operate against Hamas and ensure the security of Israel. That has been something that politicians Netanyahu included have based their careers and campaigns on. But the way that he will conduct that mission will continue to be controversial to a portion of the Israeli population. And given what's at stake here, the lives of so many Israelis, he will be under a microscope in the way that he operates. With that said, when this conflict is over, there's an understanding in Israel that many people will have to answer for what went wrong. And the ability to push off that judgment day in the Holy Land will only last so long. Thanks very much for joining us. Thank you. Tommy Larrant. What's on your mind? Dei or diversity, equity and inclusion based programs and hiring are a waste of time and money. But just how much? According to a deep dive done by Open the Books, the University of Virginia is spending a whopping 20 million bucks on both DEI employees and their benefits. Yeah, UVA's DEI program has at least 235 employees, including over 80 students under its banner. The employment comes at a cost of $20 million made of a 15 million in cash compensation, and an additional 30% for the annual cost of their benefits. This is an outrageous waste of money and resources. No wonder college tuition is unaffordable. These woke institutions are throwing money around at useless programs and padding themselves on the back for it. Thank goodness Florida Governor Ron DeSand has took an axe to this crap in his state.

I'm Brian Kilmeade. I'm Kennedy. Tuesday, March 19, 2024, only subrating. The US Supreme Court hears arguments on a fight between the federal government and two Republican-led states over pressure to remove social media posts. We've got to build a wall of separation between tech and state to protect our first amendment right to free speech. I'm Dave Anthony. President Biden heads west this week, going to two battleground states he hopes to win again in a Trump rematch. I as a Democrat and a Democratic strategist, when I look at Arizona, that concerns me more than Nevada. It's a border state. Republicans have a stronger argument with immigration. And I'm Carol Markowitz. For the second time in less than a month, the US Supreme Court hears arguments about content moderation on social media. This time, drilling down on efforts by the Biden administration to combat what it deems disinformation, pushing platforms to remove posts about COVID-related topics, including vaccines, masks, and how the pandemic started, also about election integrity. Missouri, Louisiana, and several social media users sued, claiming free speech rights were violated. And lower courts sided with the states, ruling that a constitutional violation was likely. But those rulings were blocked by the Supreme Court while it considers the case. During about 90 minutes of arguments yesterday, Justice Samuel Alito suggested the government is holding anti-trust laws and illegal liabilities shield for online platforms as weapons at the ready to get what they want from the companies. It's treating Facebook and these other platforms like their subordinates. Government lawyers argue there was no coercion. Brian Fletcher is the principal deputy solicitor general. There's a problem if the government is engaged in coercion. But if it stays on the persuasion side of the line and all we're talking about is government speech, then there's no state action. And some justices, including Kataji Brown Jackson, sound reluctant to limit government contact with big tech, as long as it doesn't cross a constitutional line. The government actually has a duty to take steps to protect the citizens of this country. Last month, the High Court heard a separate fight over laws in Florida and Texas, aiming to stop what critics call censoring of conservative views on social media. In this second case, accusing the federal government of crossing a line, the Justice Department has warned against making judges the superintendent of the executive branches communications with and about social media platforms, arguing that would be an unprecedented intrusion into another branch's power. The Biden administration also says platforms routinely declined to moderate content flagged by the government and that there's no evidence that a sanction was ever imposed when that happened. But a federal appeals court ruling that's on hold would bar a variety of officials, including from the FBI, White House, and CDC from having contact with social media platforms. Bottom line, we put on evidence at the district court level that established blagrant violations of our first amendment right to free speech through government coercion. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, government coercion of big tech social media companies targeting a viewpoint or elimination from public discourse. Now, when you say coercion, the US solicitor general says tech platforms were not coerced into censorship that they took suggestions from the government based on facts. From your perspective, is there any chance that is actually what happened? No, we can clearly establish coercion. And it would be news to Facebook that they weren't coerced because their internal emails demonstrate that they understood themselves to be forced to change their censorship algorithms to satisfy federal officials demands. But I would also point out that there's other ways to demonstrate that the federal government actually targeted the censorship. And its coercion is one element. One of the other elements is significant encouragement. And at a minimum, the communications between the federal government and big tech, even if, even if one were to determine that they didn't rise level coercion, which I disagree, they are coercion. But even if you thought they weren't coercion, they certainly represent significant encouragement to censor. And finally, when you see that there's a conspiracy and joint participation between co-conspirators, that can also constitute governmental action. And in this case, the emails from the White House and other administration officials repeatedly tell big tech that they're on the same team. They want the same thing and they're working together. So essentially, it was as if big tech had outsourced its content moderation to federal officials in the Biden administration. How crucial is the email evidence in this case? Is there a case without it? No, I think the 20,000 documents we obtained through preliminary discovery are really critical. I think that the creates the most clear picture of coercion and the big tech social media corporations. But I'd also say that the numerous depositions that we're taking are also probative evidence that establish this vast censorship regime across a spectrum of federal bureaucratic agencies. From the top of the White House, down through the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, which has been called the nerve center of the vast censorship enterprise. I mean, when you're talking about thousands of documents, I'm sure there's a lot of examples that you could give. But are there a few that stand out more than the rest? Yeah, absolutely. Just let me give you a few. Number one, specific emails from Rob Flaherty, the White House Communications Office, where he's demanding that big tech change their censorship algorithms to de-platform De-Infacizer Shadowband, anyone who is questioning the White House's COVID policies. I would also point out that the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agencies, CISOP, maintains a spreadsheet of targets for government censorship. So this is Orwellian, and it's a clear violation of our right to free speech. And the harm is ongoing. It's not limited in time because what happens is people are now less likely to talk about COVID tyranny, less likely to talk about election integrity, less likely to talk about President Donald Trump for fear of being booted off big tech social media platforms. And the first amendment protects not only people's right to speak, but people's right to hear as well. So every user of big tech or anyone who ever has obtained information from big tech is impacted by these violations. How much of this case is wrapped up in COVID versus other topics? COVID is certainly the Trojan horse that got the enemy behind the gates. I mean, COVID is the excuse that the federal government is using saying, hey, look, they believe they've got to fight back against what they call misinformation in order to promote public health. But the problem with that is if the Constitution gives way in times of national emergency, then bureaucrats will just perpetually use a national emergency to get around the Constitution to achieve illicit objectives. And I would point out too, it's dripping with irony that the federal government claims to want to protect you and me for misinformation. And yet 100% of the speech that they targeted for censorship ended up being truthful speech. But that points to the fact that the remedy for disfavored speech is counter-speech not government censorship. If President Biden and his army of federal bureaucrats didn't like what was being said on big tech social media platforms, they should have offered their own speech, not censored American voices in violation of the First Amendment. And again, the speech they were censoring was core political speech. It was protected by the First Amendment. And the ambition of the Biden administration is to eliminate any dissenting viewpoint from public discourse. And I mean, we are talking about a time of unusual circumstances, right? The height of a pandemic, and then just the fact that the internet and social media platforms have come such a long way in such a short time, is there ever a time in your mind that it would be appropriate for the government to step in and make suggestions to companies about what's posted on their platforms? No, we've got to build a wall of separation between tech and state to protect our First Amendment right to free speech. And I think some of the justice has pointed this out during their questioning when they identified the fact that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has created this government sanctioned monopoly of big tech social media corporations that are consolidated and are easier to target for censorship than a more traditional medium of communication that would be you know, would be tethered to open market principles that would mitigate against the desire to censor. Does this really boil down to a bigger question though about the internet and social media? You know, who decides what is information and how does that ever get resolved in a way that would be acceptable to everybody? The American people make those determinations, not unelected federal bureaucrats. But I mean, there are limits on certain things, right? Certain content is restricted in some way depending on what it is. So does that lend itself to the arguments that you know, actual misinformation should be restricted as well. But again, it comes down to what's misinformation, right? That's right. And the point I'm making here is that it's up to the American people to determine what they do and don't want to believe. It's not up to the government to determine what we shouldn't shouldn't hear. And especially when we're talking about protected core political speech and going back to your earlier point, COVID was the Trojan horse that got the enemy behind the gates. But we know that there have been instances where the deep state has suppressed the 100 Biden laptops story and prepared big tech social media to suppress that story once it broke. There were meetings between the Department of Justice and big tech social media platforms in the weeks and months leading up to the 2020 election, where again, they planted and germinated the seed that there would be a Russian disinformation story related to Hunter Biden. Despite the fact that the FBI knew that the laptop was authentic, at some point that becomes election interference. And so again, the topics that are subject to censorship go well beyond COVID security. How concerned are you about the implications of this case going forward in general, but also specifically for the presidential election, giving the existing concerns about election interference? I think the right to free speech is fundamental to who we are as Americans and it's vital to the health of our democratic republic. And it is a strategic objective that we must secure less we lose our national identity in the sole of our nation. What's the best case scenario for your case and for the Louisiana case coming out of the Supreme Court? What are you hoping will happen? And if they don't go all the way and give some sort of partial decision, you know, what could that look like? Well, I believe the Supreme Court ultimately will affirm the district court's preliminary injunction. And again, that's laying the first brick in the wall of separation between tech and state will then be backed down at the district court level conducting merits discovery to root out this vast censorship enterprise and put a stop to it once and for all. So, but if they if they don't go that far or if they decide not to uphold what the what the lower courts have done, I guess what's what's the worst case scenario is what I'm asking to? Well, you know, there's certainly an off chance that the court will say that the district court wrongly entered the preliminary injunction, but the case will then go on will be backed out at the district court level to conduct merits discovery regardless. So at the end of the day, we're not going to stop fighting to protect our first amendment right to free speech and to prevent the government from co-wersing big tech into silencing our voices. How optimistic are you based on what you heard during the arguments? I'm optimistic. I think that, you know, at a minimum several of the justices clearly understood what was at stake and clearly understood the coercive relationship between the federal government and big tech and understand that at the end of the day, this is viewpoint discrimination that is intolerable under our first amendment. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, thank you very much for your time. Hey, thank you so much. Great talking to you. Thank you for covering this important story. They are battleground states. President Biden hopes to win again. Today travels to Nevada, then it's off to Arizona. Confident that 2024 will be like 2020. I know it sounds like hyperbole, but it's all in your hands and you folks like you all across the country because this is how I won the first time ever ran. This is how we're going to win again. That was the president with Biden supporters last week in Minneapolis. A lot of you helped me in 2020 and we should make sure he was a loser. He is a loser. We're going to make sure that happens again. But polls have shown former president Trump leads in both states, which could be key in his attempt to win back the White House. I as a Democrat and a Democratic strategist when I look at Arizona, that concerns me more than Nevada. It's a border state. Republicans have a stronger argument with immigration. That's an area, honestly, that I wish the president and that my party would do more about. One of the things I wish that they would do more about is letting the American people know facts. For example, a lot of people don't realize that the flow of those crossing the border in both January and February was more than 50% less than in December. I'm not talking a year ago. I'm talking December. That's a victory lap that you should take. When there's apprehensions, this many, we stop this amount of fentanyl from coming in. That's not the messaging that's being heard. The messaging that's being heard is that Democrats don't want to close our border, which is laughable to me because our border is closed. Well, December, you referenced December. That was a record number. There were over 300,000 encounters at the border with those crossing illegally. That doesn't even encounter those. The Godaways that they didn't apprehend and all of that. Now, even when the numbers come down, you're still seeing a shift into other areas like they went away from Texas more in Arizona, more in California. Then there was the the amount of Chinese immigrants coming in. So it's even when the numbers change, the focus doesn't look so great for the Biden administration. True. I don't disagree with that. But then we also have to look at reasons why. I mean, think about it. Republicans are going do something about immigration, right? And the Democrats go, okay, and in the Senate will work together, right? Okay, we've got this. This is where the numbers would be. This is how much the numbers would be cut. This is how many more people would get jobs. This is how much more security and strength that we have with border control. This is how we would address the backlog and Republicans go, no, the Democrats need to push that more. That's what I'm saying is part of it is the messaging in my opinion. Nobody's I'm not advising the president, but if I were advising the president, I would I would and he's been doing it. He did it in a state of a union, but he needs to do it more, which is at least, you know, regarding the issue of immigration, here are the facts. Here's what I can do. Here's what I will do. But I want to say something else about Arizona with regard to those numbers. When it comes down, when we see numbers, and you know, certainly, you know, polls can make me nervous, but methodology has changed. I just don't trust a poll numbers as much. And I haven't since 2016. And I know there are a lot of people that agree with me on that left or right. But when it comes to the state of Arizona, I do think there are going to be segments that we're not seeing in these polls that are going to come out strong for Joe Biden. One would be seniors. Uh, Arizona, like Florida, has a very large retirement population. There are many, uh, you know, 65 plus Joe Biden does very well with 65 plus. And that, you know, the polling shows that because, you know, there's many times that Republicans have talked about taking a hatchet to Medicare and to social security. And that frightens them. Abortion is going to be a bigger issue. It wasn't the midterms. It was in Ohio. It will be in the general. And you're going to see women in youth, perhaps not, um, represented in some of this polling who are going to come out on mass, uh, to vote for Joe Biden because they don't want the alternative. They're going to be Republicans that vote for Trump because they're Republican and he's the Republican nominee. They're going to be Democrats that vote for Joe Biden because he's Democrat. He's the Democratic nominee. And that's the majority, right, of the voters. But it's that sliver. It's that sliver of independence. But I think that the, uh, older population, the women and the youth are going to put Joe Biden over the finish line. And I hate to say this, but if there was one state that he flipped that I would be most fearful of flipping back red, that would be Arizona. I want to listen to former president Trump. And he talked about some of the Democrats. You talked about Democrats voting for Biden. Listen to the former president. There's no hope with Biden. He's a dead head, but there's not no Democrats viewing. That's why the, I think the Democrats vote for me a lot more than you think. In fact, I saw where at least 10 or 12% of the Democrats are voting for me. They've never seen a number like that. See, I have a theory. People in Beverly Hills vote for me, but they don't talk about it. All right. Now, is he right? They're polls showing he has stronger support among black voters, Hispanic voters? What do you think, Leslie? Well, he has stronger support among black and Hispanic voters and red states that he's going to win anyway. Okay. But he doesn't have stronger support among black and Hispanics and blue states, or in those swing states. Yes, there are pockets, but I would be concerned if those numbers were not in the red states, but in the blue and the purple states. And I'm just not seeing that. You know, there's always a way to represent numbers, right? Sure. You know, you can always talk numbers in a certain way that benefits you. And the former president does that a lot. And sometimes he does that without accuracy. But no, Democrats are not supporting Donald Trump, but you know, double digits, a percentage, as he said. And if so, I'd love to see the data for that. Now, the president's approval rating around the upper 30s in the Gallup surveys lower than Trump approval rating at this time. George H. W. Bush's approval rating at this time. Jimmy Carter's approval rating at this time. All three were presidents who were defeated in attempts at being reelected. Does that make any nervous? Well, of course, it makes me nervous. A very tight race, even without those numbers, it makes me nervous because it's very, very tight. And Americans are very fickle. I mean, you know, we can love you on Monday and hate you on Tuesday, based on a word of sentence, what you're wearing, you know, how you smile or you didn't smile. I mean, come on, we're very fickle. Look, when Joe Biden ran last time around, I heard that he wasn't going to be president because Democrats were an enthusiastic and they weren't going to show up. Well, the numbers prove that to be wrong. I'm hoping that will be the case again, because right now, Americans see the headlines, economies doing well, but they're not feeling it. And I do feel, strongly, by the time the election comes around, they'll feel it more. And that with regard to the economy, they'll feel more positive. But Paul after Paul, I know you don't trust the polls, but Paul after Paul have former president Trump, well, ahead of president Biden when it comes to the economy, inflation is, is, is an anchor on president Biden to this day, even though the rate of inflation has come down. It's not like prices are going down. It's just the rate of increases is slowing. So that's still an issue that he's, he's been dogged by again. I'm not, you know, I'm not concerned about that. Oh, you know, I'm not concerned about that because the economy is improving almost on a day-to-day basis. And by the time the election comes around, I, I am very confident that it will, we'll see better numbers, you know, for president Biden with regard to the economy. Immigration, not so sure, you know, but democracy. Yeah. Now when it comes, when it comes to the, you know, so really, the election security is what the president's harping on that that former president Trump's a danger to democracy. He's going to be harping on that a lot too, right? Well, yes, but Donald Trump is actually doing a lot to hurt himself with some of the rhetoric that he's talking about. When you're talking about rounding up Latinos, when you're talking about detention, the centers are cancee, you know, I live in California where we had manzanar here. You know, when you have, I mean, just some of, you know, some of the rhetoric, regarding January 6th and regarding the people involved in January 6th, regarding the leader of North Korea, regarding Putin, as opposed to Zelensky or Russia, compared to Ukraine. I think there's some dangerous things being said by the former president that certainly don't help him with regard to confidence in voters to consider him somebody to keep and hold the democracy dear and free. There was an NBC report that President Biden is angry at times at his re-election camp that he's anxious about what what the strategies have been as they ramp up the re-election effort. Do you think that he's right to be nervous? Do you think that that's accurate? I think everybody when things are not going the way they would like perhaps look around at their team and, you know, I know I do. And you look and you look around at your team and you say, come on, you know, what's going on? I mean, there's been some infighting, there's been some resignations. You got to be just like a party. You have to be united. The president's age continues to be an issue as well. People see him at times, maybe looking like he might, doesn't know where he's going or something like that or he'll stumble through his speech a little bit. Supposedly he's wearing these new shoes. I guess they're called hokas or something like that where I don't know, he's on his feet to make him more comfortable. But the issue of his age and if they don't let him speak his mind and they don't let him take questions, I mean, do you think that the strategy has to change to make him look different? Well, he is an older man. But after the state of the union, pull after pull, even though man out of a bumped his approval, but pull after pull, you know, had more confidence with him and his age. Donald Trump just talked about Barack Obama beating Joe Biden. Donald Trump has been making, you know, arguably as many slip ups, if you will, as Joe Biden. But for some reason, they just, you know, they the press want to harp on Joe Biden and Joe Biden's age. Look, Donald Trump won the presidency, but then he lost it, which means there are people that were enamored with and voted for Donald Trump that didn't the second time around. The people that didn't vote for him the second time around, I don't think the majority of them are going to vote for him the third time around. Because I think that most people don't like to go back. And that's not just because it's Donald Trump or Republican. I think people want to move forward. Thanks so much. Thank you. A maintenance man for a downtown Los Angeles apartment building who died last month is believed to have faked his own death years earlier to escape a child rape charge in Washington state. The LA County Medical Examiner's office discovered the true identity of Mark Clemens was actually Christian Robert Boschum, who was arrested in 2008, charged with second degree child rape and released on $350,000 bond. Months later in March 2009, a witness reported seeing Boschum jump from the Tacoma Nero's bridge. Searches from boats and airplanes never found a body, but his car and a suicide note were later discovered and he was assumed to cease. The medical examiner's office says they have alerted the Bremerton Police Department about Clemens true identity. They say that local Washington detectives will be looking into his movements after his supposed death 15 years ago. Carol Markowitz. What's on your mind? Quote that war ended the way all the other wars have ended with our closest ally saying that's enough end quote. We're listening to a talk by Abraham Levine speaker and digital content manager from the Alma Research and Education Center, a nonprofit dedicated to research and analysis of the security challenges Israel faces on its border with Lebanon. Levine is referring to the 2006 war Israel fought with Lebanon after Hezbollah launched a sneak attack on Israel first launching rockets and then kidnapping two soldiers. If it sounds familiar, that's because it is. It's a cycle that Israel's forced to live through every few years, suffer death and destruction bite back, be told to stop it. Levine is giving this talk the day the Biden administration gingerly walked back their red line comments regarding the Israeli defense forces continuing on to Rafa. This time is unusual because Israel has taken the step of evacuating 80,000 people from their homes in the north after the October 7th attacks in the south. Will they ever go back? How? When? The phrase existential crisis is on everyone's lips. I had spent nearly a week in Israel hearing the perspective on the ground more range of people, experts and civilians alike. The trip featured wild emotional swings. We visited hostage square in Tel Aviv and spoke to families of those being held captive in Gaza. We walked among the memorials at the site of the Nova Music Festival, were teenagers out for a good time on a Friday night were slaughtered. It was sad and infuriating. Still all around us is a country fully flourishing and alive. Israel goes through periods of relative quiet. But the last wars never really over. Leftists in the US and Europe brush off the Israeli deaths that happen at these incursions and try to make Israel's square peg fit into their round ideological hole. But not a single leader in Israel or anywhere else would conduct a gentler war after this lawtelling of teenagers and the elderly in their homes and the kidnapping of babies still in their pajamas. Or the continuing misconception that Israel's troubles are caused by their quote occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. When you listen to Israel's enemies speak, however, it's clear that what they want isn't a free Gaza or the West Bank, but an occupied by them Tel Aviv and Haifa. None of the murderers on October 7th shouted out free Palestine. They called their parents and bragged about killing Jews. The point is not their freedom. It's Israeli destruction. Before the attacks on October 7th, Israel was in a very divided place with large weekly protests about judicial reform. Since then, the country has united, but obvious fractures remain. All over Tel Aviv, half of Netanyahu's face appears on billboards with the words, you are the head, you're guilty in Hebrew. Even what should be non-political becomes political. I'd hostage square, small protests have sprung up to pressure the Israeli government to make a deal, any deal, as long as the hostages are returned. This has caused a fracture even among hostage families. Some of them will understandably push for absolutely anything to bring their loved ones home. Others think the long-term strategy of the country needs to take precedence. There's a sense that Israel simply can't keep doing this every few years. Hamas needs to be dealt with in the South and left only somewhat unsaid is that the North will ignite sooner rather than later as well. America looms large. Will their closest ally let them defend themselves or will we cut them off from destroying their enemies and begin the cycle anew? Israelis are on their edge of their seats waiting to find out.

Saturday, March 23rd, 2024, I'm Jared Halpern. The Republican House majority keeps getting smaller, with a new threat now facing Speaker Mike Johnson. Let me walk you through this math here, so it is literally going to be a one-vote margin between April 19th and June 11th. I'm Jessica Rosenthal. The Supreme Court heard arguments in quite a few cases this past week, many of them boiling down to free speech and really what sort of pressure amounts to a violation of the First Amendment. It's very important that we don't let the government get into the business of censorship, of deciding what's a preferred view or an unpreferred view. For term, spinning bills and the fights and brinksmanship they produce will be avoided for the next several months. Friday morning, the House overwhelmingly approved what is called an omnibus spinning bill. It's a package of several appropriations bills, funding federal agencies for the rest of this fiscal year, so through September. As a Friday evening, the Senate was still working out timing agreements to fast track the measure and avoid a partial government shutdown over the weekend. But the votes are there and it appears to be a matter of when, not if, the more than trillion dollar package gets final approval. So by the time you are listening to this, it could be a done deal. Still the vote is opening up some fresh wounds in the House and it could again test the speakership. Georgia Republican, Marjorie Taylor Green filed a motion to vacate threatening the hold of vote that could oust Speaker Mike Johnson. The general consensus up here is that they're not going to have a government shutdown. They're going to finish this before the deadline here. You never quite know and I noticed that Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, he filed culture, the term of art here to break a filibuster. And by rule, if you file culture on a Friday, you can't vote on it until Sunday. That needs 60 votes. You would be able to break the filibuster because as I said, they had 78 votes in favor of the overall bill to get onto the bill. But then if they run all the traps, that means you might not finish the thing until Monday. What does that mean? A short government shutdown. But they basically did get a deal. They passed this bill in the House of Representatives with way more democratic votes than Republicans. I think that's significant. They continue to do this over and over and over again. I mean, there were 185 Democratic yeas and only 101 Republican yeas in the House. And that is precisely why Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican representative from Georgia came out and said, I think it might be time for Mike Johnson to go. She has introduced a resolution. It's not hot. It's not live. They don't have to consider it right away to basically remove him from the speakership. This is exactly what happened last fall with Kevin McCarthy. She said the motion to make that's right. This is a pink slip is how she determined it or called it. So so so now this doesn't mean that he is going to face that vote. But this is this sort of damacly is that is now lording over Mike Johnson. I want to talk about that because obviously that to your point is going to hang over him is the House is unresist now for a couple of weeks. But before we kind of talk about what's next for Mike Johnson briefly, let's get into what is in this bill because I know that was a great consternation to at least some of the right flank of House Republicans. A little bit over a trillion dollars for these very important agencies keeps the government operating to the rest of the fiscal year. So about another six months. How much of that spending would have been included in say that supplemental package that included age for Israel, the border and Ukraine, anything? Well you see that's something else that Marge retailer Green had talked about. She said, you know, her her previous marker was if he brought that bill up that she would move to vacate. So that's not being consistent. Now she said, oh, this bill wasn't wasn't something that that's there. So that that that would probably, you know, push it over the edge. But I should note to people that, you know, they don't know where they're going to go in Ukraine. Mike Johnson has talked about a Ukraine bill. He's talked about maybe having an Israel bill of some sort. He talked about that right after Chuck Schumer's comments a couple of weeks ago. You know, there's still a couple of different parliamentary options to go around the speaker. And Mike Johnson might like this actually because then he doesn't have to weigh in where you could have what's called a discharge petition. A discharge petition is where you get a solid number of 218 votes in the house. And if you get them to sign this discharge petition, then guess what? You can put your bill on the floor. That's only happened twice in the past quarter century. The other thing that I think might be more, I might have a little more potential actually. And this gets really technical, but it's, it's important and it's historically important, Jared. It's called defeating the previous question. Know what does that mean? Now, a lot of times if you're watching C-SPAN before a vote, you'll see them vote on ordering the previous question. So that in parliamentary terms to the guy watching at home, what that means is you're going to vote in order to have a vote on the underlying issue. Basically, it's like a procedural vote to say, let's take up this piece of legislation. Let's vote to have the vote on the thing. Yes, exactly. It's like a pre-vote, so to speak. So if you defeat the previous question, the people opposed get control of the floor. And then you can put anything on the floor you want. And the history of this and why this is historically important is that this is what happened in 1981 with you had Republicans in the house and these moderate to conservative Democrats, the so-called bull weevils, as they were termed at the time, which is a pest in the south. And they were able to pass the Reagan tax cuts. And that's probably the most significant time to defeat a defeat of the previous question and they get control of the floor. So let me understand kind of how this would work. And so in this scenario that you're laying out, there could be, I guess it wouldn't matter what the piece of legislation is. Any piece of legislation, they defeat the previous question. They say we're not going to vote on this. And anybody who voted for defeating it, so I guess against ordering the previous question. They prevailed, right? They would prevail. And then they can put any piece of legislation they see fit onto the floor. So in that scenario, it would make sense for Republicans and Democrats to say we're going to put Ukraine in Israel funding on the floor now. Right. And this is what would work. That's how it would work. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And what you would do first is you've written this, you would have a rule that you would put first. And so then if you adopt the rule, then you get to debate the bill and then you have to approve the bill. So there's a couple of the steps there. But yes, and in short, that's what it would be. And it's so rare to do this. This is why Patrick McHenry, the congressman from North Carolina, who's leaving on CBS, he said that this is kind of like nuclear war. And the reason that members are loath to sign this is because they interpret it as beating up on the leadership here and not being consistent. Yeah. I mean, you're going over your own speaker's head. Right. But and the people who want to do that type of thing right now are not the people who are for age, Ukraine. Right. You know, this is the freedom caucus. So it's a weird combination of things. So yeah, that's why that's only been successful once since 1981. That was in 1988. So this does not happen very often. But I will say this, Jared, we are in a very, very strange period right now. And so strange things like that could happen. And if there's going to be a path, maybe to pass that bill, one of those two options might be on the table. Well, and to that point, because Friday afternoon was just, you know, crazy. I've been in Washington and specifically in the House of Representatives because there was another Republican, Mike Gallagher, kind of once viewed as a young up and coming Republican. I think he's 40 years old out of Wisconsin. Has been sharing that that China committee that's looking into China's influence in the United States. He says he's going to leave early. Yeah. Next month, mid April. That's right. When he steps aside in mid April, that leaves the margin of error for House Republicans at a single vote. It's pretty bad. And here's why you have Ken Buck, who is stepping down at the end of the week. Okay. Then what will happen at some point, you have Mike Gallagher, who is stepping down. Then the Democrats, there is a special election in Western New York for the seat of Brian Higgins, who resigned. Democrats are expected to win. That's right. And even more narrow. And this is the tightest the numbers have ever been in the House of Representatives. I mean, Mike Johnson said the other day after Buck leaves, it's at 1.16% is the difference there. And then it's going to get more narrow with Gallagher departure and also then with the, you know, again, if the Democrats win the seat there, there might be a little bit of help on the way if Republicans win this seat in California for Kevin McCarthy's seat. There's a one-off for that seat that'll happen and that'll go back toward the Republicans, obviously. I'm going to be to later this year. And what we're looking at though is just so many members are so disgusted with what's going on here, certainly on the Republican side, passing bills with Democratic majorities, big majorities, actually. And this is where Pete Aguilar, who was the chair of the Democratic Caucus, he said a couple of days ago, he said that Hakeem Jeffries is not the Speaker of the House, but he is the leader of the Congress. And who is absolutely right? So you and I have talked about this dynamic. I remember, you know, when McCarthy was ousted, you and I kind of talked about, you know, is it possible that there is a scenario in which Jeffries become Speaker or there's a kind of consensus speaker and you had talked about how, you know, that's nothing like that has ever happened before. The House has never flipped in the middle of Congress. The Senate has, but not the House. Do you think we're any closer to making history on that? Never would I say a few minutes ago about weird things happening up here. I'm saying it. No, and, and, and, and you always hear what I say. It's all about the math and it absolutely is. And so let me, let me kind of, the math is attracting. There's a lot of traction going on. Let me, let me walk you through this math here. So it is literally going to be a one vote margin between April 19th and June 11th, but there's actually a couple more seats that are there because you lose one, but there's three seats. You know, there's a three seat difference. So you still have to have several other people quit. And it has been presented to me and maybe this timetable is being accelerated here that you could have people leave before, maybe after the midterms, in other words, the lame duck Congress. And then you have to like to speak and it would probably be Hakeem Jeffries, frankly, that could be very strange. You could just have this happen now because people up here, I've never seen so many members who are so upset and so disgusted and so frustrated. And so if you have the opportunity to go home early, you have the opportunity to go home, you have the opportunity to get a decent paycheck off of Capitol Hill. There are some people who might do that. So you might have history made here where you have, you know, the House flip in the middle of the Congress. That is certainly on the radar screen right now. So that leads us to where we started in this motion to vacate or at least a notice of an intent, whatever we're calling it for this motion, the vacate from Marjorie Taylor Green. I know she has kind of talked about it in views of kind of a warning shot to the speaker after this mini bus omnibus spinning package was passed. One of the criticisms that Kevin McCarthy leveled against Democrats was that they could have prevented this chaos in the House that, you know, he kind of blamed the eight Republicans who voted for his dismissal for siding with Democrats. That dynamic still exists. Would Democrats feel differently about doing this again, ousting Mike Johnson or maybe are there some Democrats out there that they're going to say, listen, we don't need to go through this. Let's just keep them here for a few more months to see how the midterm elections go. It's unclear because you might have Democrats who may be say they support Mike Johnson because it actually helps them moderate Democrats. They might, you know, be willing to do that. It's a different environment now where Democrats might say, ooh, you know, if there's a couple more retirements, maybe we get the chance to flip the House. Okay. Right now. So they might be unwilling to do that. I mean, you know, it causes K. I mean, let me just present a scenario. And this is just me, you know, reading between the lines here. Maybe they do have a vote to vacate. And there's no speaker and Democrats are like, and then people just start quitting because they're like, we've been to this once before this had never happened. And so we are out of here. And Democrats get the majority then something. I mean, I could see that. It's unknown. The bottom line was this is that Kevin McCarthy, I've talked about how Republicans, most of them, maybe with the exception of Marjorie Taylor Green, are willing to give him deference. And they don't like what's going on, but they're willing to say, okay, he's fighting as good a fight as possible. And we're not going to move to vacate. And I heard some. Some Republicans say that he kind of inherited this, that he didn't create this. Right. And even Marjorie Taylor Green, by not making her, her, her resolution hot, that kind of reflects that, that type of thinking here too, Jared. But here's the other thing. It's not so much that they like, and I'm talking about Democrats right now. It's not so much that the, that, that you have Democrats who, who liked my Johnson Moore, I think they, they view him as earnest and trustworthy. And he's demonstrated that in negotiating these bills, just not because Democrats have gotten some of the things they wanted. But they're like, yeah, this is what we negotiated. And it was negotiated in good faith. And it was fair. But it's just that they did not like Kevin McCarthy. And that's the same problem that was going on in the, but they didn't like him. And, and, and, and that's why I always kind of have viewed him as an accidental speaker. He didn't become the speaker of the house in 2015 when John Boehner went away. He was right there on the precipice. He was the majority leader because members were looking for reasons to vote against him because they just did not like him. And I'll tell you what, the, the whole story about Kevin McCarthy is played out in this spending bill. And here's why go back to last spring, Jared. And they were dealing with the debt ceiling. And so they, there was an agreement between McCarthy's team and the White House on the debt ceiling. And they agreed to a spending level for funding the government in the fall. And then what Kevin McCarthy did was he told members of the Appropriations Committee to go and write the, the bills at lower levels that were not reflective of the debt ceiling agreement. Right. Okay. And so people immediately started to see Kevin McCarthy talking out of both sides of his mouth because he had promised all sorts of different things that were not consistent to all sorts of different people. Then we get to the fall. And because the bills aren't done because they were written to the other level and not the debt ceiling level. And that is still being borne out here in late March because of the decision made by Kevin McCarthy last spring to try to protect himself politically by saying, okay, I'm going to agree with a debt ceiling agreement here that I don't really want to, but I know that's good government. I'm going to get smoked inside of my conference, which happened. And then I'm going to write the spending bills to a lower level. And then that helped him a little bit, but not enough to save his hide in the fall. And that's why we are dealing with a potential government shutdown in March. Jared, they have never started a government shutdown before the 18th of January. And here we are potentially staring at one in late March, almost two months on. Although, albeit probably if there is one very shortly, a briefing. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. The latest this could kind of go out would be kind of what midday, Monday, like I said, Monday, probably, yeah, it's probably not even going to go to that. But listen, what's happening in the house and how this spending bill now kind of sets the stage for governance for the next six months is remarkable. Because to your point, we have now these resignations. You have this warning to Mike Johnson. It might emboldened Democrats. Does it move forward? Does it make it more likely, less likely that Ukraine aid? Ukraine aid gets gets done? Well, that's where I talk about those two scenarios with the discharge petition and moving the previous question. I think that that puts that more on the table now. I wrote a piece about this, a blog a couple of days ago explaining this process. It's pretty arcade. Or is there. Yeah, obviously, or is that like the leverage that Johnson has? Johnson maybe gets Democrats to not go along with this by putting something like that on the floor. Maybe again, you know, I just know one thing that there are so many options out there for my Johnson and none of them are good. That's that's the problem. And again, that's why the Democrats, if they can just pluck off enough Republicans, because you might also have as a counter to Marjorie Taylor Green, some Republicans who are interested in funding Ukraine and quote, you know, government making sure the trains run on time say, look, okay, it's obvious that getting on this band of the people who were trying to impeach Mayorkas and impeach Mayorkas and do all this other stuff. One of the reasons Ken Buck announced his resignation, because he didn't agree with the impeachment of Mayorkas. By the way, that trial hasn't started yet in the Senate. That's a whole other story about it. Right. The other way, Jared. But anyway, but that's why people might say, okay, yes, we'll vote for the Ukraine stuff. Because really, the only things they have to do the rest of the year after this is fun. The government in September, oh, and by the way, K Granger, the chair of the appropriations committee, who is leaving at the end of this Congress announced seconds after they passed the bill that she is stepping down this Congress as the chair of the appropriations committee, because she doesn't want to go through this melee and the fall to keep the government open. And it will be so they're going to ask for the policy who gets that because that that may be other than Speaker of the House is the most important position in government. And certainly as you go toward funding the government, the fall, I mean, we could have, we could have the house flip. And again, it might be a moose point of the house flips. I mean, then you have Rose DeLarro from Connecticut, who's the chair of the appropriations committee. So yeah, so maybe, maybe we shouldn't spend much time on trying to figure out who's the chair on the Republican side because maybe this all changed. I don't know. Well, thanks for joining me on what I know has been a really slow spring Friday for you. Yeah, really, really, really just cruising along here. All right. Have a good weekend if you have one, Chad. Hey, there. It's me, Kennedy. Make sure to check out my podcast. Kennedy saves the world. It is five days a week every week. The Supreme Court heard a number of arguments this week, including several first amendment and speech related cases. One case involved the NRA after New York State financial official was accused of pressuring insurance companies to cut ties with the gun lobbying group. An attorney for the state officials said she was just doing her job going after insurance policies that were illegal under state law, but even justices on the more liberal wing of the court, like Sonia Sotomayor, sounded skeptical. What she was seeking was a ban, even a potentially lawful affinity programs. In another first amendment case, Sylvia Gonzalez said after winning a city council seat in a Texas town, she drew up a petition to push out the city manager. After a meeting, she tucked the petition back into her pile of paperwork. And the mayor, who was friends with that city manager, said that was theft of government property. That also drew some skepticism from justices across the spectrum. As attorneys for the mayor and city said, hey, that was a legitimate crime. Justice Neil Gorsuch asked them, how many statutes are there on the books these days, all many of which are hardly ever enforced. Last I read there were over 300,000 federal crimes, accounting statutes and regulations. I can't imagine how many there are at the state and local level. And you're saying they can all sit there unused, except for one person who alleges that I was the only person in America who's ever been prosecuted for this, because I dared express of you protected by the first amendment. And that's not actionable. But the one a week began with a case called Murthy V. Missouri. Lower courts had sided with state officials who said the Biden administration went too far in telling social media companies what posts to take down or restrict and what was disinformation. Justice Kataji Brown-Jackson asked, your view has the first amendment hamstringing the government in significant ways in the most important time periods. The government actually has a duty to take steps to protect the citizens of this country and the government encouraging or even pressuring platforms to take down harmful information. So did federal officials violate the first amendment by coercing or significantly encouraging content moderation decisions? So this first case about whether social media companies had been cooperating with the government to suppress, to sent in views about COVID and so on. It's a hard question. Johnny, you as a professor at UC Berkeley Law School. Johnny, I think if you were just guessing from the oral arguments, the justices aren't persuaded yet. I'm not saying they never will be persuaded. But right now they want to see some evidence that the government, the Biden administration here, actually coerced social media companies to take down posts from people like Jay Bada Charya or Scott Atlas. People actually, I think, have turned out to be right about the farm, massive farm that lockdowns were doing. And so the problem for the core, based on the questions, was yes, we see all these emails and texts where the Biden administration is saying, take down this post, take down that post. What we don't see is what did the government threaten to do to the social media companies if they didn't comply? One of the questions I heard, and I forget which justice positive this, I might have been Justice Salito, who said before social media platforms, do you think this kind of thing would be occurring? And actually, two justices who did work at the White House, Justice Kagan and Kavanaugh said absolutely, it was normal practice before social media existed to call up reporters and publications and basically get mad at them and tell them that they'd publish something inaccurate. Do you think that those justices lived experiences in White houses actually is a solid or significant influence here? Yes, I think it is because the fact you have a number of the justices, including Justice Salito himself, who served in the executive branch of government. We think it's wrong or you're hurting the country. Please, please take it down. Nobody I think in this case says, government can't do that. What makes a difference is if the government then says, and if you don't take it down, well, you know, we know that we can always sick the Justice Department on you to see whether you should be allowed to buy that company you want to buy. That's the part, not the speaking to the press, not trying to persuade people to write a different kind of story, but the next step. Nice little social media platform you've got here. Be sure you have something happened to it. Oh, that was a very clever line. And that's very pertinent. I wish I could say I invented it. It's very pertinent to the conversation right because it's something we, it's like a very me-mish type language, which sort of intersects with my next question. And that is, you know, you're saying there's a line, right? There's a line that has to do with threatening, but is there also a line, and I don't know if it's being considered here, maybe it would require a different case, that we're determining or we're saying what should be published, what is disinformation, especially in a time of COVID, a time where things were so fraught. And as you just noted, some of those people who had their things taken down, who were, who were humiliated, who lost their followings, who were criticized as being liars, they ended up being right. Is there a line there? It's very important that we don't let the government get into the business of censorship, of deciding what's a preferred view or an unpreferred view. Now, the government, I think, sometimes takes us too far as the Biden administration here did where they say, we know the right answer. And so we have an interest in driving off what they call disinformation, which might, in the end, because that's how science works. In fact, that's how law works is you allow and have dissenting critical voices. Sometimes those voices are the ones that turn out to be right. And so that's another question, which I don't think this case will get into, which is we really should sit and question whether we want the government in the age of social media, where it is so easy to go to just a few companies and put a chokeholder bottle neck onto public discourse, whether we want the government to be going out there and deciding what's the preferred view and what's the unpreferred view, what the capital T capital S, the science says is the right answer. When we all know actually that science, like any other kind of inquiry depends on critical views on discussion and debate and then the possibility of changing your mind. I think also it's curious to see it happening right now as lawmaker after lawmaker holds hearing after hearing about regulating social media, about section 230, about liability protections and and whatnot and protecting kids online. And yet nothing has been passed, nothing has been done to rein in or regulate social media companies. And this sort of access or back and forth that government has with social media companies in light of a failure to pass any legislation. Does that look weird? Actually what you've mentioned about the lack of action in Congress and the agencies plus the very generous immunity that the social media companies have under section 230 gives you a good reason why the states might win because if you were the social media accounts put yourself in that position. Maybe you don't need the government to have an explicit threat on the table because they know that the government could always ruin the party for you they decided to change how they're going to enforce section 230 or Congress is going to ask Congress to change section 230 or bring all kinds of enforcement actions against you which the Biden administration could choose to do. You know, it's not it's not the coincidental. The Justice Department just announced a massive antitrust investigation into Apple. Yeah. Right. They're showing the things they can do to the technology companies if they want to. So if you're the CEO of Apple, the CEO of Facebook or Google, you will do what the government asks of you even if they don't have to say explicitly all the things that the government can do. Okay, just a couple more for you. Another First Amendment case we heard about this week had to do with another kind of pressure. In this case and involved the NRA, a New York Department of Financial Services employee was accused of pressuring insurance companies to stop doing business with the NRA or to stop doing business with those who are endorsed by the NRA and how far the state official went in threatening companies seems like even the justice is more liberal members were a bit concerned here with this one case and involving the NRA inciting with the NRA. Yes, this case in a way has the same element to it that the social media case has the idea of the government intervening into private markets, private networks and trying to play favorites with different points of view with the implicit threat behind it of government action against you if you don't cooperate. So there's two things going on. One is we should be concerned about speech, the right of the NRA to speak its mind about the Second Amendment. Just like we have the right of Dr. J. Botticciariere, Dr. Scott Atlas to question the COVID lockdowns. The other thing these cases bring forward is how vast the power of the government truly is now. You want to talk about Latisha James going after Donald Trump and winning a $350 million judgment. If you see that and you're in New York and you're a bank and the attorney general says, you're really sure you want to have the NRA as a client at your bank. What are you going to do? I don't think you're going to keep the NRA as your client because the power of the government of these attorney generals or the Justice Department has become so all encompassing that's easy for them to retaliate against social media companies or banks that don't want to cooperate with them. Okay, finally on the First Amendment cases, John, this one seemed a little bit more tricky. Sylvia Gonzalez won a city council seat in Castle Heights, Texas after which she drafted a petition and this was a few years back. She drafted a petition that the city manager pushed out. Well, that city manager was friends with the mayor and after she put this petition that she drafted back into her own possessions after a council meeting, the mayor said, oh, look, she stole government property and she was arrested. She says, this is obvious. I was punished for my speech, for my petition that I drafted, but it's actually not so cut and dry, right? This is if she did in fact do something wrong or that is actually breaking the law, the Justice's were actually focused on that. So I think it's, without a doubt wrong, what the city and city managers did to her. The question, in that case, is really a narrow one, which is what kind of justice does she get? Can she actually get money or can she just have an order from the court telling them to stop? Can she get some kind of disciplinary procedure undertaken against them? So I think that case actually in the end might just turn narrowly on, look, there's no doubt that her rights were violated. The government was retaliating against her. But is she allowed to get money from those people? Usually the courts, the Supreme Court, most of all, is very leery of saying that the personal pockets of government officials are on the line because what they're not, what they're worried about is not these jokers who are obviously breaking the law here, but they're worried about the police officer or the firefighter who has to make a snap decision on the street and then getting sued for money, which could destroy their livelihoods maybe because someone doesn't agree with the choices they made afterwards. One more question before I let you go because this was not and this was not a set argument, but we did hear from the Supreme Court very briefly on this text slide. S before there was this lot of legal back and forth fifth circuit then to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court had blocked this law and then they said no, it can be enacted or enforced rather while the legal case plays out. And then a different panel of the fifth circuit said, you know what, we're actually going to put the whole thing on hold again. This S before law is about enforcing immigration law, but rather enforcing a state immigration law that makes illegal immigration that makes being undocumented in Texas, a misdemeanor punishable by jail. State judges would have the authority to order you deported and local law enforcement would then drive you to the border, it sounds like there is some lingering confusion about how this would actually be carried out, it sounds like if you listen to the fifth circuit arguments, but I'm just wondering, haven't we gone over this? Is this not under federal, is immigration law not under federal jurisdiction, even if even if the federal jurisdiction is we don't want to enforce any border laws. What do the state, what can a state do? So first all the stuff that involved the Supreme Court, I think people misunderstood what was happening because what was going on at the court was the Supreme Court was really a fight about how quickly should they intervene in a case? Because this dispute between Texas and the US is moving its way up from the trial judge who found the law unconstitutional, the Texas law unconstitutional to, as you said, the fifth circuit court of appeals. And basically the Biden administration wanted to leapfrog the court of appeals and go right to the Supreme Court. And so what the Supreme Court just said is no, we're sending it back down there and let it take the normal course. In fact, if you remember, this is exactly what they did when special counsel Jack Smith tried to rush to the Supreme Court. And again, the Supreme Court said no, the regular mechanism of justice is going to operate. And that's all that's all it did here. It didn't really, the Supreme Court didn't take a view on the law on question. Now I have to say that the Texas law under existing Supreme Court precedent, I think is almost certainly unconstitutional because the Supreme Court has said Arizona passed a law very much like this about 10 years ago. SP 1070. And the Supreme Court, yeah, the Arizona versus United States. And the Supreme Court struck it down. And it said, unlike most other areas, immigration is one of those few questions where the federal government has complete authority. States are not allowed to participate at all in immigration matters. Even to the point of trying to help the federal government, not to mention being an obstacle to the federal government. And so this case will ultimately turn on whether this new Supreme Court with a very different membership than that one 10 years ago chooses to reverse Arizona. I won't point out that the Arizona case, the more conservative justices were in descent. So I could right easily see this Supreme Court after the fifth circuit is done taking the case and then perhaps finding for Texas. Interesting. And Texas, I mean, they they did a number of things, right? Like the Lone Star operation, they've built some sections of wall. They've deployed their own state troopers to sort of assist border patrol. There are things the state can do, but you're saying this line in particular might have it might have gone too far. Actually, if you read Arizona closely, it suggests that Texas is not allowed to do anything about immigration. Now, once illegal aliens are in the state and they commit a crime under Texas law, for example, they commit robbery or trespassing, then they're just subject to Texas law like anybody else. But under Arizona's, the Arizona precedent, Texas is not allowed to have the barbed wire there along the Rio Grande. They're not allowed to have their own border patrol. They're not allowed to try to catch illegal aliens. It's hard to actually realize in Arizona how complete and sweeping federal power is over the border and over immigration. But I think that's why it's it went so far. I think is why this court is probably willing to re examine it and try to find a better balance between the federal right over immigration, but what over what states are allowed to do? You know, you're reminding me actually that what states can do is deploy their national guard if they want to backstop border patrol in a non-law enforcement capacity, but in a more administrative capacity, that's been something that's been relied upon since SB 1070's decision. Yes, and well, the other thing that's interesting here is Texas does have a new argument that wasn't raised in the Arizona case, which is a either the level of illegal migration or be the kinds of groups involved with it, are such a threat to the security of a state like Texas that it has the right of self-defense, which is recognized in the constitution. That states do have some kind of right of self-defense. The question is really whether this movement of legal aliens is invasion. I mean, that's what the constitutional case, either an invasion or an imminent danger that triggers a state's right to self-defense. Otherwise, the federal government still has, you know, the predominant authority over the border, over over foreign affairs. And so we could have to see whether the court is going to entertain the idea that the movement of two to three million illegal aliens here across the border represents an invasion of some kind.

Sunday, March 17th, 2024, I'm Jared Halper. Sell or else, Congress takes a first step to block TikTok in the US. Obviously TikTok is very valuable and I believe that there will be a number of people and entities that would be interested in purchasing TikTok. The rematch is official, President Biden, former President Trump clinched the delegates they need for renomination. You need to mobilize even more voters because your margins amongst that constituency are down, and that presents a real problem I think for the Biden campaign. Politics can make for strange bedfellows. Take for example the vote this week in the US House on a bill to force the sale of TikTok or the current Chinese owners facing a ban of the app in the US. Supporters include President Biden, Florida Republican Marco Rubio, former speaker Nancy Pelosi, current House speaker Mike Johnson, just to name a few. In total, the House passed that bill 352 to 65. Opponents included Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene and New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, former President Trump, who in office attempted the block TikTok also urged opposition to the bill, arguing it could expand the reach of meta properties like Facebook. Now the bill still needs to clear the Senate, and that is not a done deal. No vote is set. And Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was non-committal in a statement following the House vote. In the meantime, prospective buyers are considering a sale. Former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says he's putting together investors to potentially purchase TikTok. Washington, Republican Kathy McMorris Rogers helped usher that TikTok bill through the House. She chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee that unanimously advanced the legislation earlier this month. I asked her about the urgency, the constitutional and free speech concerns, and what other social media regulations she'd like to see. The choice would be TikToks, so they could either choose to continue to operate as is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party because they are owned by bydans, or they could choose to divest separate from bydans and the Chinese Communist Party and continue to operate in the United States of America and businesses and individual users could continue using the app the way that they always have. Would it have to be an American buyer or could it be a French buyer, the Japanese buyer? Is there a specific, like it has to be American? No, not at all. This bill only applies to applications that are subject to the control of specific adversaries that are listed in the bill. And so we list these foreign adversaries as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. I saw it in sort of one of the headlines that the former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has said that he's trying to put together maybe a group of investors. That would be fine by you. Yes, so what this legislation does, this bill is about banning foreign adversaries, as I just said, so it's about banning foreign adversaries like China, Iran, Russia, or North Korea from collecting massive amounts of data through these apps. So targeting, surveilling, manipulating American people through apps such as TikTok. And we have concerns about TikTok being owned by bydans that is controlled by the CCP. So if this bill were to pass, TikTok would have to make this choice. And yes, it could be open to Stephen Mnuchin or other buyers in the United States of America. They could decide to take the company public. There would be a whole host of options. And obviously TikTok is very valuable. And I believe that there will be a number of people and entities that would be interested in purchasing TikTok. Let me ask about those security concerns because TikTok and bydans have said that they do not have this coordination with the CCP. That the government in China does not have the kind of access to this data that you guys fear. Do you have evidence that they're lying about that? TikTok has repeatedly been caught in this lie that it doesn't answer to the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP, through bydans. We know that TikTok has been used to spy on American journalists. And we know that TikTok has been used to surveil American user data. Even last week, when we were voting on the Bill and Committee, that morning, the 177 million users in America on TikTok did not have access to the app that morning until they actually called their representative and voiced their opposition to this Bill. So TikTok had blocked their access to the app. And that's just one example where they have the potential to manipulate people for their own gain. And even internal TikTok employee recordings have revealed, we have quotes where they've said everything is seen in China. And we know that we cannot trust China to safeguard our data, uphold American values of freedom. We know that China surveils on its own citizens. And we cannot allow this cool of the Chinese Communist Party to be used to target, to surveil, to manipulate American people through an app like TikTok. I'm curious about the content side too, because I know that there have been concerns expressed by some TikTok is a platform that can spread misinformation, disinformation, especially worrisome I know in election years. Is that a part of the calculus that you seem to be talking more concerned about what China has access to? Maybe not so much the output. Am I reading that kind of right? Yeah, this Bill is targeting the threat that TikTok poses because the national security threat that TikTok poses because it is owned by bydans that is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party. And the access of 177 million American users on this app, it does not regulate content or get into content at all. How much of this should Congress play a role in? I mean, there's kind of an expectation I would think among most tech, you know, most people online now that you're kind of giving up a level of privacy, giving up a level of data right when you you join these apps. Like I'm a parent, I don't have my kid on TikTok because I share some of the concerns you've talked about. I'll come into visuals in America. Parents aren't capable of making this decision on their own. Well, unfortunately, we do not have a national data privacy security law in place, a standard in place. I have been working on that separately, but companies are collecting enormous amounts of data just every actionable data point. You know, they're collecting it from people's location, those who they're connecting to, other forms of sensitive information. I believe that we need a national data privacy security law in place to protect Americans online and especially our children online that are being targeted today. And that's a separate legislation that we're working on in Congress. This Bill is really unique and targeted towards the threat that having a company like TikTok that is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party having access to all of this information and all this personal data of Americans because the algorithms are hidden to us. We know that they are manipulating this data and it is especially concerning. We have grave concerns about TikTok being owned by a foreign adversary that is controlled by this Chinese Communist Party having this access and what that means to our national security. We've been briefed by our national intelligence agencies. Those are on the front lines and they have impressed upon us that this is a very real threat. The other question that I had and I'm sure you saw it. I think it was a day or two before the vote former president Trump came out. He opposed this bill. He said that he worries that it's going to enhance the reach of meta, Facebook, of Instagram. He's very critical obviously of the ownership of Mark Zuckerberg. Have you spoken to him? Were you surprised by that response? And what is your answer to that type of criticism that this is only going to create a bigger problem with another social media company? President Trump did not say that he opposes what we're doing. Rather, he did express the concerns with big tech at large. I completely share those concerns and that's where I'm committed to continuing to work the reign in big tech. What this bill does is really finish some work that former president Trump started four years ago when he was as president working and seeking to force TikTok to divest, to separate from the Chinese Communist Party via its ownership by by dance. That is what we are attempting to make sure happens with this very narrow specific bill. When you look broadly at social media, I know you're a mother. I don't know if your kids are old enough to be on all of the social media. My son's about to turn 11 so we're kind of entering that world and I'm learning a lot more about it frankly than I knew a couple of months ago. But listen, there are concerns right about the impact that has on mental health, the impact that it has on self-worth. Certainly the spread of maybe dangerous information. Where should Congress kind of begin and end in trying to regulate this field, whether it's TikTok or a company that's US-based like Metta or X? Well, let me start with TikTok and the bill that passed the house and just make very clear that TikTok is different because it is owned by a foreign company. Oh, yeah, certainly. Yeah. So from a data collection point, I see how they're different. But I guess I'm talking more about the other concerns that we hear about social media. Because I know all of these are issues that kind of fall within your jurisdiction in the ENC committee. Yeah, so that bill is very targeted specific to foreign adversaries. Separately, we have been working on legislation that would bring in a national data privacy security law into place. It would protect Americans online or children online. It would prohibit the targeting of our children. That says, and what that legislation does is it limits how much data can be collected to begin with. It gives individuals a right to know what their profile is. It would prohibit the targeting, the collection of your location data, your search, history. Right now, there's just limited amounts of data. You'd collect data. And then how that can be sold. So what the legislation does is put some protections into place for the individual so that if your data, first of all, you know what the profile is. And then if your data is being sold, if it's being transferred, if it's being transferred to other countries, that you would have to be notified. That you would, and if an entity, if a business is collecting more data beyond what they actually need for a specific purpose, then you would have to give permission for them to collect data beyond what they actually need for their business purpose or the relationship that you have with this entity. I think that's an interesting component to this because, especially as it kind of relates to these adversarial countries that you point out in this bill, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, like they can kind of get at this data through other means, right? I mean, there are like these data brokers and things like that. That's got to be sort of part of sort of the broader issue you're talking about. Yes. In fact, we did the Energy and Commerce Committee also has passed out unanimously bill that would prohibit data brokers from selling our personal data to these foreign adversaries. And that bill will be voting on this week or this next week in the House of Representatives. On this issue, I'll finish with the Senate. Do you think they're going to take this up? I think that there was some, were you surprised that it kind of the non-committal response we've seen this far from the US Senate on this bill? Are you in conversations with Chuck Schumer and others over on the other side of the Capitol building? Yes. Actually, immediately after the bill passed, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner and Senator Marco Rueger issued a statement in support. There's other senators that are also voicing support for the bill and for us taking action. There happens some other bills that have been introduced in the Senate to address apps like TikTok, but we are in active negotiations and I'm hopeful that the Senate will take action very soon on this bill. I wanted to finish with this if I may, only because I know you have announced that you're not running for reelection after quite a while in the House. And I'm just curious, there seems to be kind of a trend of that, right? A lot of your colleagues that have been sort of veteran lawmakers are deciding to retire, do something else. What's behind that? I mean, is it just kind of time that to pass the torch or is Congress not as much fun maybe is it used to be? Well, it's a lot of fun when you're chairing a committee. I can tell you, it's been great fun in such an honor to chair the Energy and Commerce Committee to be able to lead on important legislation like we've been discussing today continuing to work on privacy legislation. Another priority of mine has been price transparency and health care, which we also are working on. For me, it was, it really was time, it's time to go home. I do have young kids. I have pre-young kids, 16, 13, and 10 and just feeling like, you know what, it's time to pass the torch to the next person. It's been an honor and privilege to serve. And I do believe in this institution deeply. It's an amazing institution, the House of Representatives and Congress and such an honor to serve. And there's going to be, there's a lot of people, I think there's 10 that have already announced that they would like to have consideration to take my place in the house. Well, I appreciate you taking this time and explaining this bill, listen, there's a lot of attention on this and a lot of people have questions, so I appreciate you answering ours and always appreciate the time you've given us over the last several years as well, Congressman. Thank you very much. Good to be with you. Thank you. The election more Americans than not say they do not want is the election voters will have. This week, President Biden and former President Trump both secured the delegates needed to become their parties nominees in November. Officially, neither will be re-nominated until the conventions to summer, but for all intents and purposes, the general election is now on with both campaigns laser focused on the candidate they ran against four years ago. Rather you helped me in 2020 and we should make sure he was a loser. He is a loser. And we're going to make sure that happens again, right? They never talk about his competence. He's grossly incompetent. Don't you understand that? The question is whether or not he's going to get to the starting gate. I can only help. You know, challenged him to a debate. If the campaign and the candidate sound familiar, there's a good chance the electoral map, those of us in my profession spend a lot of time looking at, will also be familiar. A handful of states out west and in the southeast and especially the upper Midwest will likely determine if President Biden or former President Trump get a second term. Former President Trump won both states in 2016. President Biden won both in 2020 in the case of Arizona, only by about 10,000 votes. Is it stands now the former president leads by slim margins in both Arizona and Pennsylvania, four points, 49 to 45 and a head to head rematch in Arizona, two points, 49 to 47 and a head to head rematch in Pennsylvania. Now, this is a good time to offer the caveat I give whenever we talk polling. Poles are not predictive, but they do provide data points and they help shape trends, trends that in several swing states show the former president with advantages at the dawn of this general election. Darren Shaw helps put these polls together for us. Yeah, Arizona, as you mentioned, is, I mean, make an argument along with Georgia, I guess, the two kind of critical battleground states from the last election, razor-thin margins. Yes, we have the same candidates and there are largely the same sorts of issues, but there are a couple of interesting changes. The first is Hispanic voters have gone from roughly two to one Democratic in terms of both their party identification and their vote preferences. So 65-35, fall party. Right now, about 55th, and it's a difficult population to survey correctly. We had in our poll for instance, Spanish language interviewers and Spanish instruments for respondents who prefer to answer. In Spanish, we take all sorts of precautions, but it's still tricky. Part of it is that amongst Latinos, levels of engagement are lower and they're less kind of sconst in the party system. They're nominally democratic, but sort of the defining characteristic is the party system has never really spoken to them in a way it has for white and African-American respondents. Right? So that's a shift. Young people, a core part of Biden's coalition in 2020, are kind of iffy towards both candidates. You know, in some both Hispanics and African-Americans and younger voters, I should say, it's not so much that they're sprinting towards the Republicans. It's just that they're kind of traditional alignment with the Democrats seems to be a roting little bit, right? So it's a, I mean, just to kind of follow up on that, it's not a question of whether or not they vote for Trump over Biden. It's a question of whether or not they vote at all. I think it's two things. There's a mobilization question and then there's the margins, which is, you know, African-Americans, what we're seeing in in Pennsylvania, we saw earlier in our Georgia poll and their North Carolina poll as well, which we did last month. You know, what's happening is that Biden's margin is going from 90 to 10, so like an 80 point advantage to something like 70, 25 with, you know, the remainder going to third party candidates. It's not that Trump's going to win African-Americans. I don't even think it's going to win Hispanics, although it's much closer there, but Biden's margins are way down. And so the mobilization problem that comes in because, you know, you need to mobilize even more voters because your margins amongst that constituency are down. And that presents a real problem, I think, for the Biden campaign. The other interesting component in Arizona, and I'm curious if it shows up in polling and kind of the effect that it has on a presidential race is that Senate race. Kirsten Senema, who was a Democrat, turned independent, was going to run as an independent, it was going to be a three way race. She is now not running as an independent, Carrie Lake of pretty divisive figure in Arizona is the Republican nominee. You have Geyago, the Democratic Congressman, also kind of a defensive figure for her a lot of Arizona's running. What role does that Senate race play in kind of turnout in kind of driving people to the polls? Is there kind of a down ballot poll or is this kind of an up ballot poll? How do you see that Senate race playing out in Arizona? I think the presidential race blocks everything out. It's like the totally clips that we've yet. You know, I had a colleague at Maryland University of Maryland, Jim Gimbal, who used the phrase shouting in a crowd in cafeteria. And I think that's what you get by September and October of the presidential election campaign. One interesting feature to we didn't run a Senate race ballot because from a poll source perspective, it's a little difficult prior to the primary. Even though we think we know who the candidate is going to be, but the other candidates get mad at us and the accuses of creating a scene. We don't want that. Yeah, exactly. But we did run a generic House vote in both Arizona and in Pennsylvania. And the idea was, let's explore this possibility that there is a Trump tax, which came about after 2022. In other words, the pro-Maga candidates, the Trump candidates, underachieved compared to party expectations in certain states. George is the most obvious example right with Kim. The governor's level running much stronger than a Herschel-Walker in the Senate. But what we're finding in Arizona and Pennsylvania is that there's a very, very modest discrepancy between the expected vote for Republicans and what Trump is pulling right now. And if that's the case for Trump, I'm interested to see whether the initial polls of Lincoln-Guy-Ego show something similar. Does Kerry Lake underachieved the way that she underachieved by most accounts in 2020, 200 Senate rates? Because right now, it looks like the ultimate mega candidates Trump is running about what you'd expect. Kind of a traditional Republican would get in Arizona, and that's plus four to six. Let's talk about Pennsylvania. Again, a state that Trump won. Trump lost. Biden won. He has his roots and scrant, and he talks about, I think, he has spent more time in the state of Pennsylvania than he has in any other state over the last four years. Still has in this latest poll that you guys put together, Trump up too. Certainly, well within the margins. What does that tell you about how contested Pennsylvania is going to be? And kind of the coalitions that each candidate is going to have to pull and hold together in the commonwealth? Well, first of all, just to you stepped on the headline. Biden's from scrant, gee, I hadn't heard that. He likes to talk about it. He may have mentioned that in past. What's interesting here is it seems to be the case. This is a little true both of Wisconsin and to a lesser extent Michigan, these upper Midwest days, part of Hillary's famous or infamous blue wall. The attic crumbled. Yeah. Right. They crumbled. And the dynamic that we saw in 2016, we saw, it repeated in 2020, but that is less well-educated, white kind of blue-collar voters moving away from the Democrats, towards the Republican candidate. And that held in 2020 was just that traditional democratic constituencies turned out, especially in Pennsylvania, high enough rates to overcome that. So you've got this really interesting fight where the African-American vote has held a little better for Biden and Pennsylvania than it has in other states. So George and North Carolina, for instance. So that's helping Biden. His vote in the urban areas, especially Philadelphia, seems to be holding pretty well. We're showing his advantages amongst suburban women. Biden's doing reasonably well there. And Pennsylvania is the one state where younger voters have not really abandoned by and become more a swing group as they have in some of the other power ground state polls we've run. On the other hand, if you look down and we get a little suspicious about going to subgroups or regional analyses, our poll is 1200 registered voters, but we do have a sufficient number in the Pittsburgh area. So not just Metro Pittsburgh, but the Pittsburgh area, which does include Scranton. And Trump is running surprisingly well out there, better than he did in 2020. In fact, it is overall advantage accrues largely to running well in eastern and western Pennsylvania right now. Now, is that kind of a statistical outliers in Arnhemback? Because I've heard there some interesting articles this week about the Democratic machine in Scranton and about Democratic support in Pittsburgh. But in our poll, we're actually finding that Philadelphia, and especially suburban Philadelphia, remains a critical battleground and that Trump is actually doing less well in the T right now. He's a proper central region of the country relative to what he did in 2020, 2016, then he is in western Pennsylvania. So that's something to keep your eye on. We've seen, I think the campaign almost, the travel kind of tells that story too. You look at, you know, Biden has done I think two or three events already in sort of that mainline area of Philadelphia, right? Those kind of outer suburbs, he was in Blue Bell. He's been in a few of those other areas. The other thing that I was fascinated by in the poll that you did, and I'm glad you did this is you did, obviously these head-to-head matchups, which are important, but also looked at how these results turn out if it's not just head-to-head, especially in a place like Pennsylvania. You include Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in these polls, Jill Stein, Cornell West. You have in Pennsylvania, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. getting 9% of the vote. That's, I mean, it's not quite Ross Perot territory, but that's pretty outstanding for an independent candidate, no? Yeah, this is, I think the Perot parking back. I cut my teeth in the 92 campaign, paying attention in 96 quite a bit, and Perot was in June, 92 was at 40%, with actually leading the planet. I think people forget that he dropped out, that he came back, but Kennedy isn't that high, but from Polster's perspective, we wanted both out here. We're not sure whether Kennedy's time, West are going to qualify in all these battleground states right now. That's the question, right? Yeah, exactly, but they're on track too. As you point out, the interesting thing that comes over here, I think people assume that the Kennedy name will disproportionately draw Democrats to his candidacy. I think it's a mixed bag. I mean, you listen to his policies the way that he is appealing to a lot of base Trump voters, no? Yes, that's exactly, I think that's exactly right. He's got this populist anti-big pharma, anti-establishment appeal that really resonates with Blue Kyle. It's funny. You think back to the original Bobby Kennedy, and who he appealed to, and a lot of these lower status whites as well as racial and ethnic minorities, right? And the same sort of things that Kennedy talked about in a slightly different context is what R.F.K. Jr. is talking about. And so it, it Pennsylvania, it's a modest effect, but it goes from plus two Trump and just a head to head to even with Ken. 42, 42. Yeah, and I think that is almost entirely driven by the fact that he's peeling away some of these blue-collar white voters who kind of had it. They think the system is rigged. Kennedy speaks to them kind of the same way Trump does. It will work differently in different parts of the country, I think, but in Pennsylvania, it would not shock me if Kennedy ends up marginally hurting Trump, but marginally is enough to swing a race right now. Well, especially, and so I guess you kind of answered the question. I was going to say if you're the Trump campaign or the Biden campaign, who's more worried about kind of, you know, Kennedy getting on, he is not, he needs to get on the ballots, and that is not an easy task to do, but assuming that he does, who is more worried about that? Oh, it's a good question, you know, I got to say RFK is, you know, if you follow this campaign, for instance, I listened to a four-hour podcast with RFK and Joe Rogan, and I came away from, yeah, I was a trip from Austin to Dallas, Seema to Ice, but other, it was an interesting trip. I've made that drive many times. Yeah, pretty interesting. And I came away from that thinking that, first of all, these long-form interviews are really good for RFK. Yeah, you know, he does well. So when he has a chance to kind of really get ramped up, I don't think either of these main party, major party candidates wants him anywhere near debate. It's not clear to me they want to debate each other, and they certainly don't want Kennedy in the mix. I think his natural appeal right now, given the coalitional shifts in the parties over the last eight years, I think his natural appeal may ironically be a little more Trump-y than his democratic. On the other hand, I think it's a really marginal tendency, and the other two candidates in the race, West and Stein. That's bad news for Biden, right? They're unequivocally... I mean, because you saw what happened with these sort of uncommitted voters in the Democratic primary, and listen, I don't know if that translates to a general election, but it shows that there is a level of discontent, especially among progressives, and if there are other choices, they may pull deliver for those choices. Exactly, and we talked about younger voters, voters under 30-year-old age, who do not have the same kind of history to tackle with the major parties. And if they're animated by issues like abortion-like... The warrens. The warrens. The mosque conflict. Yeah, Gaza. Then why wouldn't Stein or West be appealing to them? You know, it'll be interesting. I remember in 2000 when the Gore campaign spent one of the last weeks of the campaign. They went hard after Ralph Nader. Guy, remember, yeah. Get a watch in the Sunday morning, says, and Gore went in, and I remember thinking, well, they're giving Nader a lot of attention. Is this really a good move? And turned out it was a very smart move. I mean, they basically collapsed Nader's support. I think he went from five or six percent to about two. And I wouldn't be surprised if you see a similar move kind of deep into September or October, which is if these three candidates, especially RFK, continue to draw, I wouldn't be surprised if you don't see a concerted effort to delegitimize those candidates. He's by the major party candidates. That's a high-risk strategy, right? Giving them oxygen, giving them attention, and especially when, you know, in Nader's case, the appeal was almost exclusively to Democrats. But in the case of Kennedy, in particular, I think, I'm not sure if I go after him, if I'm Biden or Trump, and I go after him, it kind of make him a vehicle for the other side. I mean, you might counter-mobilize, right? So it's a very tricky calculus. Yeah. I mean, I'll just finish with this. It is the middle of March, and we are in a general election mode. What is the level of fatigue that you think voters could have come November? I think it could be pretty high. This is the irony, which is that everybody talks incorrectly to read the polling information that nobody really wants these two candidates. That's correct. Strong for it to have a new crop. On the other hand, one of the things we know from political science is that fear and anxiety and anger tend to be more powerful motivators, with respect to turnout, than hope and optimism. Not always, but, and one question is, yes, we're going to be tired of this. Are we really going to learn anything new about Trump or Biden over this endless campaign? On the other hand, I would expect a very high turnout election, because each side sees the other side as presenting an unacceptable alternative. In fact, I mean, that's, on the Democratic side, here's an account of the counter-intuitive notion. I think Democratic turnout and mobilization is largely baked into the cake. I think there's such a anger and fear of Trump. Yeah. Anti-Trump movement is so strong amongst Democratic voters. Right. And then the question then becomes on the right is Trump's appeal to his base, after eight years after he merges on it, seem politically, and is anger and intipity towards Biden sufficient to mobilize Republicans at the same kind of level. Now, I'm saying it's counter-intuitive, because right now Republicans are expressing greater enthusiasm, but they're the out party. And the out party almost always expresses greater enthusiasm. I'll be interested to watch this wax in Wayne, you know, 500 months as we slide towards election. Well, I am excited that it presents an opportunity for you and I to have many more of these chats between now and then. And well, probably a few off-air as well, but Darren, I always appreciate your insight. You guys at the polling unit are going to have just a tremendous amount of work between now and November, and certainly we appreciate all of your efforts on our election nights as well. So, Darren, enjoy whatever break you get between now and then and we'll talk soon. All right. Thank you very much. Take care. I'll souversight committee chairman James Comer will answer that.

Every hour on the hour we bring you up to speed on the latest news from around the world in five minutes. Who will Hades next leader be? It seems to be anyone's guess. Days after the country's prime minister announced his intention to resign, the plan to get a transitional government in place is being tested. Politicians of all stripes have also started jockeying for power and Haitian citizens. Well, they are expressing reservations. Adir, let's start with what you've been seeing and hearing down there at the border. Yeah, we've been seeing a lot of Americans evacuating from Haiti and we've been seeing the Dominican authorities supporting busloads of Haitians. They've long run a mass deportation program here and they haven't stopped it despite the circumstances. The Haitians I've talked to have expressed a sense of desolation, of dread. So many people here I've talked to say this is in God's hand. I met Rafael Marqueson even at 23. He's cynical. He says yes, the prime minister has promised to resign and yes, the international community has crafted this plan to put a transitional council in charge, but he's pessimistic. And he says ever since he was a kid, Haiti has been in disarray. So he asks what makes you think that anything will be different now? Now that's along the border in northern Haiti. Have you been able to gauge at all the reaction in the capital, poor prince? There's been a broad praise for the prime minister's decision to resign, but there's been sharp criticism of this plan, which was brokered by the international community to install this transitional council. One example, I spoke to Guy Felipe. He's a former Senator, former Chief of Police. He helped lead a coup against Jabr Drade's deed and he was sent to jail in the US for drug-related money laundering. He was deported to Haiti three months ago, but he says he wants to be president and he has built a following fairly quickly. What he told me is that this plan was drafted without any Haitian input and it puts in power the same politicians who got Haiti into this mess. He says the plan focuses on sending foreign forces to fight the gangs and he says it ignores an open secret in Haiti that politicians were the ones who have funded and armed the gangs in Haiti. President, the prime minister, the ministers, the elite, they are the worst gangs in Haiti. So Guy Felipe has started a campaign for president. He promises to give amnesty to the foot soldiers and come after the politicians who he says put them there. They mentioned foreign forces to help fight the gangs. I was at peacekeeping force that was arranged. Is it still happening? I mean, does it look like it's going to be deployed? It's installed. The Kenyans who are supposed to lead this force say they will not send their police until Haiti has new leadership. This deployment was approved by the UN last year and it has been delayed over and over and this is yet one more wrinkle. And one more thing, I mean, you're reporting from the Dominican Republic side of the border. Are you still hoping to get into Haiti? That's a source subject, look, we've been trying that the Dominican authorities have not allowed us to leave their country by land and cross into the border into Haiti. They say it's for our own safety. They say it's to avoid a diplomatic problem with Haiti. The airports are closed in Haiti. So a land crossing with the Dominican Republic is the only way for us to get closer to this story. But, unfortunately, despite days of appeals to the Dominican Foreign Ministry, to immigration authorities, to the presidency, we have not been allowed to exit the Dominican Republic to cross into Haiti to bring our listeners this story. Thank you, A. The world's first comprehensive AI legislation is here and it comes from Europe. European Union lawmakers have approved the Block's Artificial Intelligence Act. It aims to shape the creation of what they call human-centric AI with regulations which will apply to any product or service that uses the technology. Terry Schultz joins us now from Brussels to tell us what the regulations will and will not do. Terry, governments around the world are trying to figure out how to regulate AI, so what's the European Union doing? Well, this AI act is pretty ambitious and they use quite proud of it. It took several difficult years of negotiation and public feedback. They had to balance this complicated technology and a very powerful industry with consumer protections and then get 27 governments to agree to the same set of rules. Here's one of the parliamentarians who led work on the law, Drogos Tudorake. We have a duty to recognize this potential because it is going to be the technology that will be driving us into the future and at the same time, we realize that clearly the law risks, the law concerns. All right, so that's the philosophical approach to Terry, so how are they going to do it practically? So the AI act will classify systems or applications into four categories, according to what's considered their potential risk to society, from low to limited to high, up to unacceptable. And each of these will be subject to different levels of regulatory control. At the low end, there won't be any requirements or regulation and at the unacceptable end, they'll be bandled together in the EU. So, okay, give us some examples of what we're talking about here. I mean, who gets to decide how risky a certain use of AI would be? Well, at the low risk end or application such as AI in video games or spam filters, we're all familiar with those. And at the unacceptable end, our use is such as biometric identification, which will be prohibited in public spaces, except in special cases like law enforcement or counterterrorism. But authorities will have to get special permission and it will be really strictly limited. EU government, so the ones responsible for evaluating and enforcing the act on their own territory, but the block is set up in office here in Brussels to help coordinate and make sure it's being done in a fair way across the EU. It'll also provide guidance for companies and developers, so they're in compliance. I had developers. That's the other party in this. So, what's been the response from the tech industry, from those developers? And what happens if companies just don't want to comply? Parliamentarians said it was one of the most heavily lobbied pieces of legislation in years, but they feel like they've both protected consumers and the technology's potential. This is how it was described by Brando Benefe, one of the co-leaders of the parliamentary work. Too many citizens in Europe are skeptical of the use of AI and I think this is a competitive disadvantage and this would stifle innovation. Instead, we want our citizens to know that thanks to our rules, they can trust the businesses that will develop AI in Europe. So, I'm not sure if tech companies are buying that explanation of how more regulation is going to be good for them, but they won't have a choice. The act will get final approval from EU leaders in the next month or two. It'll be gradually implemented over the next two years, and then, violators can be fined up to 7% of a company's annual turnover. I will see how it works out. That's Terry Schultz in Brussels, Terry. Thanks. So, other candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are seeking to capitalize with third party bids. And they're trying to gain attention in unorthodox ways, like maybe naming a famous professional quarterback to the ticket. So, Dominico, RFK Jr. is the nephew of a former president. He's controversial. He took false stances related to vaccines and most members of his family don't want him to run, but he is running. He is running as an independent, so how is he planning to name a vice presidential running mate? Well, that's right. We don't know who that's going to be, but the campaign confirms that in addition to others, Kennedy's reached out to former Minnesota governor and wrestler Jesse Ventura. And yes, Aaron Rogers, the former green bay packer and current New York jet. We don't know how realistic this is, but Rogers has praised Kennedy. They align on their views on vaccines. I mean, you remember that during the pandemic, Rogers landed in hot water after claiming to be quote, immunized when he'd never been vaccinated against COVID. And he's also continued to needle those who are promoting vaccines. Yeah, the announcements in Oakland, he went to Cal. Aaron Rogers went to Cal nearby. And he's supposed to be being the quarterback of the jets in November. So I don't know how he's going to handle both if he's the guy, but okay, so why Kennedy doing this now? I mean, just for attention. Certainly helps in that regard. I mean, he needs signatures to get on balance across the country. And that's a tough thing to do when you're not affiliated with a major party. But more practically, he needs to meet filing deadlines that require naming a vice president. And it's not just Kennedy who's doing this or needing to other third party candidates like Cornell West, the Harvard professor says that he's going to name a VP by the end of the month, too. And then there are groups that are trying to sort out the top of their ticket, like no labels. So where are they at with who might they pick? Yeah, no labels is sort of stalled right now. And today the group is going to announce the panel that would be tasked with picking a candidate. The group so far is really struggled to find someone several higher profile moderates like Senator Joe Manchin and West Virginia said no, Maryland governor Larry Hogan is opted to run for the Senate. Nikki Haley said that despite her differences with Trump, she's a Republican. The latest potential name being floated is Jeff Duncan, a former lieutenant governor from Georgia. But it's not clear. No labels is going to find anyone at all at this point. And that's music to Democrats, years who believe a third party moderate would only hurt Biden's chances. So realistically, then, I mean, what impact could third parties have on this presidential election? I mean, they could be pretty decisive and could create a path for Trump back to the White House. So Trump has a pretty solid basis support, but didn't get above 47 percent of the vote in either 2016 or 2020. He won in 2016, though, when the third party vote was 6 percent, he lost in 2020 when it was less than 2 percent. RFK Jr. potentially scrambles things in really unconventional ways. I mean, polling has been inconsistent about who we pull from the most, but Democrats are particularly nervous about his campaign and with good reason. He's got a famous Democratic last name. His campaign says that he's polling best with people under 35 and seeing lots of them at rallies. And the issue said that he's campaigning on skews pretty progressive, calling out corporate greed, being pro-environment, and against war. That's a really big potential problem for Biden who needs younger voters and the left flank of his party if he hopes to win reelection. And former president Trump has called RFK Jr. a very smart person. You know, I just thought about it. Aaron Rogers only plays one game a week.

Did his state of the Union address win over skeptical voters? Donald Trump is poised to install loyalists atop the Republican National Committee. If we want to compete and win, we must embrace early voting. Why is the US standing by him? It's time to give Haitians a chance to fix Haiti because I guarantee you they won't screw it up as bad as we have. Stay with us, we've got all the news you need to start your day.

At Planet Money, we take you to the furthest reaches of the global economy. From the currency black markets of Buenos Aires to the Caribbean island where no one owns property, to the giant underground caves where the US government stored a national cheese supply. Cheese Cave! Was it a state of the Union address or a campaign speech? My fellow Americans, the issue facing our nation isn't how all we are. It's how older our ideas. Hey, angry vans, retribution are the oldest of ideas. Speaking to a joint session of Congress last night, President Maiden rejected both concerns over his age and the man he referred to only as his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. Now this week feels like the unofficial start of Trump versus Biden Part 2. Nikki Haley suspends her campaign leaving Trump as a presumptive Republican nominee, and then Biden did not say Trump's name 13 times in last night's state of the Union. So what stood out to you? Well, there were a lot of expectations on Biden last night, not just for the content of his speech, but for the performance, for the delivery. And Biden was feisty. He was willing to engage on unscripted moments with Republicans in the crowd. He did have some stumbles, though, and notably toward the end, he took on the issue of his age directly. You know, this was a speech that in my view offered contrast with Republicans on everything from the economy to abortion to immigration. And unlike some of the previous state of the unions that Biden has delivered, this speech was not about trying to find common ground with Republicans. You know, at the same time, there were a couple of moments where Biden asked Republicans to work with him, for example, on more aid for Ukraine and a border bill. Though I should point out that immigration legislation is dead in Congress. Yeah, so on immigration, because that's been one of the GOP's favorite avenues of attack on the president. How did he try to address that? Biden blamed House Republicans for blocking that bipartisan border deal last month, and he did criticize Trump rather directly on this issue. Again, not by name, but he talked about how Donald Trump has spoken about immigrants as poisoning the blood of the country. But really, the moment that stood out to me was when Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia shouted at Biden about Lincoln Riley. She's a nursing student who was killed last month, and an undocumented immigrant has been arrested for the crime. Hi. Hi. Lincoln, Lincoln Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal. That's right. You know, this back and forth, I think, shows just how complicated it is for Biden to navigate immigration. He is already facing criticism from some within his own party for his get-tough and using the term illegal is only going to underscore that concern. You know, and at the same time, it is unclear whether he'll win over independent voters who have identified border security as one of their top priorities. Now, President Biden has come under a lot of pressure from some Democrats on how he's handled Israel's war against Hamas. What did he have to say about Gaza? Well, he's been criticized for showing a lack of empathy for Palestinians, and last night he spoke in more compassionate terms about Palestinians than we have heard from him before. He referred to the situation as heartbreaking and spoke of orphaned children, families without food. He also spoke directly to Israeli leaders saying that humanitarian assistance cannot be a bargaining chip. And the outline plans to establish a temporary peer on the Gaza coast to get humanitarian aid into the region via sea. You know, ultimately, I will say on this issue, though, what Biden wants, what his White House really wants is a temporary ceasefire to free hostages and allow more aid into the Gaza Strip via land. That is MBR's Osmehallah. Thanks a lot. Good to talk to you. All right. Now, too, that predecessor Biden kept referring to in a speech. Donald Trump is poised to take control today of that Republican national committee. The RNC needs to elect new leadership just as Trump hivots from the primary to the November general election. And the committee members are expected to pick several Trump loyalists, including a family member. Yeah, here to tell us all about it is MPR's Franco or the UN. So on the surface, all this Franco sounds unusual. Is it unusual? I mean, actually, eh, not really. I mean, the RNC no longer has to play this neutral role in the presidential primary. You know, that former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley has dropped out. That makes Trump the GOP's presumptive nominee. So he'll get a lot of the party resources that he's been craving for months, including access to finances, staff, and donor lists. And this is very important for Trump because he and Republicans are looking to close that fundraising gap that they have with Biden and the Democrats. All right. So these new leaders that Trump is backing, what are some of their plans? Well, Trump has hand selected Michael Watley to be the chair. He's currently the chair of the North Carolina Republican Party. He's known for running a good ground game. You know, North Carolina traditionally has close elections, but under Watley, they've won a lot of those races up and down the ballot. He does come with some controversy, though. He fought against the results of the 2020 election. Now co-chair would be Lara Trump. She's of course married to Trump's son, Eric Trump. She actually outlined one of her priorities just a few weeks ago at the conservative political action conference or CPAC. The truth is, if we want to compete with the Democrats, we cannot wait until election day. If we want to compete and win, we must embrace early voting. And, A, I'll just note that that she's demonstrating a little independence here since her father in law has repeatedly criticized mail-in ballots as being fraudulent without any evidence, of course. And one more important name to mention is Chris Lasavita. He's a senior advisor on the Trump campaign who is also expected to take on the role of chief operating officer for the RNC. So he's going to do both. Still Frank, I mean, an inlaw as a national committee chair. I mean, everyone with a GOP is good with that. Yeah. I mean, it's definitely raised some eyebrows. Yeah. I mean, here in Houston, you know, the people I speak with, there seem to be okay with it. They've talked to me that it's more of a ceremonial role of fund raising role. All right. Now, apart from the leadership vote, there's been a debate about the possible resolution to prevent the RNC from paying Donald Trump's legal fees. So what's the status on that? You know, there are some concerns, especially when it comes to having some money for lower ballot races, but they don't seem to be going anywhere. I spoke to Morton Blackwell, a member from Virginia, who is here in Houston. And like others, he sees the investigations of Trump as political. And therefore, he says he's open to the idea of the party covering some of those fees. The fact is that there is something called law fair going on here where the Democrats are trying to use the powers of the government to punish Republicans and particularly Trump. And it's absolutely outrageous. Now, we should note that the U.S. Justice Department operates independently of the White House. But for Blackwell and others, the RNC's ability to raise funds is directly tied to its relationship with Trump. And having Lara Trump on board helps with those efforts. All right. There you go. That's MPR's Franco or the ONU. Thanks a lot. Thanks. All right. I made a dramatic standoff. Hating has extended its state of emergency for another 30 days. Armed gangs continue to demand the outstri of the country's de facto prime minister. They have led coordinated attacks on government buildings, including two prison raids that turn loose thousands of inmates. They are still surrounding the Port of Prince Airport. And the prime minister, as best we can tell, he remains stranded outside the country. MPR's Ada Berata is following the story from his base in Mexico City. Hearing Laila describe it sounds bad in Haiti. How bad is it? I mean, it's pretty bad in Port of Prince. The airport is still closed and local news outlets are reporting that criminal groups have been looting the big containers at the city's main port. So the operator there says that they had no choice but to shut down. So the prices of goods and fuel have shot up. Some hospitals have closed. Others are over capacity. UNICEF says that a lot of basic social services are on the brink of collapse. And the group of Caribbean leaders who have been trying to mediate a political solution to this say that the talks have led to no consensus on anything. Yeah. So the prime minister is at the center of this standoff. What do Haitians want? You know, Haitians have been taking to the streets for more than a year calling for Henri to resign. And it's important to remember that Henri was appointed, not elected, after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021. And what has happened during his rule is that the country has spiraled very close to anarchy. And even though he promised elections, those have never materialized. And what we're seeing right now is a kind of surreal moment. Nearly everyone is calling for his ouster, the people, the rich, the poor, the intellectuals, and now even the gangs. And they used to fight against each other. And now they have united to launch coordinated attacks to try to topple the government. And so now these gangs, which have really brought misery to Haiti, are now presenting themselves as liberators. So then given all that, why is the United States still standing by Henri? That's a good question. And I asked this to Daniel Futt. And he's a former American diplomat. He was appointed as the special envoy to Haiti after the president was assassinated. And he quit in part because he says the US wouldn't listen when he told them that they shouldn't back Henri, that he didn't have legitimacy, and that picking him would put the country on a path to chaos. Daniel Futt says that this has happened over and over in history, then the US has done the same thing, which is to pick someone they think they can trust, instead of learning to trust the leader who the people choose. It's time to give Haitians a chance to fix Haiti, because I guarantee you they won't screw it up as bad as we have. And Dan Futt says this is complicated but doable. He says there's a big civil society in Haiti that had already put together a roadmap toward elections, but the US ignored it. Instead, the US is focused on bringing in the Kenyans to lead a peacekeeping mission and avoiding American troops on the ground. It's worth noting that US support for Henri does seem to be softening. At least that's what we can discern from the public statements by US officials. That's MPR's Aitor Betta. Thanks a lot. Thank you, Aitor. And that's a first for Friday, March 8th. I mean Martinez.

This is Royte's World News, bringing you everything you need to know from the front lines in 10 minutes. I'm Kim Van Al in London. First, the headlines from around the world. Bordeaux City Hall up in flames, the French protests show no sign of abating. Demonstrators are furious at President Emmanuel Macron, pushing through wildly unpopular pension reforms. Manhattan prosecutors have hit out at House Republicans who object to a criminal investigation of Donald Trump. An elitist sent to the Hill, DA Alvin Bragg's office said Trump created a false expectation that he'd be arrested the next day. Trump told his followers he was going to be arrested on Tuesday after a grand jury indictment of allegations he paid hush money to pawnstarts Stormy Daniels. The grand jury didn't take up the case on Thursday, and are not expected to meet again until next week at the earliest. Trump plans to hold a large rally in Waco, Texas this weekend. India's parliament have disqualified opposition leader Rahul Gandhi as a lawmaker. It's after a lower court sentenced him to two years in jail on charges of defamation. The charges stem from a 2019 speech where he referred to thieves as having the surname Modi. Gandhi supporters say they'll take to the streets Friday to protest his conviction. And the Chinese Communist Party is able to use this as a tool to manipulate America as a whole. Lawmakers across the aisle have grilled the CEO of TikTok. At issue is whether the Chinese government can access the personal data of the 150 million Americans using TikTok. CEO Shoujou Chou vowed the app would take the safety and privacy of its users seriously. We will firewall protected US data from unwanted foreign access. The hearing comes as more politicians are taking up the possibility of banning the app in the US or forcing a sale of the Chinese owned company. A wave of Israelis have pledged to reject call-ups for military reserve duty if the reforms proceed. Like this Army Reserve Officer asked only to be identified as Major E. We decided that we cannot serve and support an army that actually functions as an army of dictatorship. The US and Canada have reached a deal aimed at stopping asylum seekers entering the shared land border. Canada will take in an extra 15,000 migrants over the next year from the West in hemisphere on a humanitarian basis, according to a US government source on the deal. It expands the existing safe third country agreement so it applies to the entire length of the land border and asylum seekers using unofficial crossings will be turned back. Now to a momentous and divisive announcement in world sports. The council has agreed to exclude male to female transgender athletes who have been through male puberty from female world ranking competitions from March 31st this year. Mitch Phillips, our European sports editor, listened in to world athletics president Sebastian Coe. Whatever they do, they are going to leave either trans athletes feeling excluded or they're going to leave women athletes feeling they're not on a level playing field. World athletics also tightened restrictions on the amount of testosterone allowed in competitors who were assigned female at birth. It's what the organization calls difference in sex development athletes or DSD for short. It'll impact athletes like South African track star Kesta Semenya. The track and field governing body also lifted a ban on Russian athletes for doping, but Russians won't be at events anytime soon as they're still banned due to the war in Ukraine. Which is your favorite nickname that Trump's given you so far? Is it Ron Rondersang Tumernis or Meatball Ron? I don't know how to spell disank Tumernis. I don't really know what it means, but I kind of like it's long. It's got a lot of valve. I mean, so we'll go with that. That's fine. You know, you can call me whatever you want. I mean, just as long as you also call me a winner. His policy stances may help him win Florida, but they could cost him the big prize in 2024, says a new Reuters Ipsos poll. The governor's positions on abortion and guns are popular enough that he could win the Republican nomination over Donald Trump, but his foreign policy stances already earning him critics in his own party. Graham Slattery in Washington, DC has been following the governor. So Graham DeSantis had to walk back his line this week that the war in Ukraine is a territory dispute. Could foreign policy hurt him on the way to 2024? It could hurt him both in the primary and in the long run. It's one of the few issues where the Republican electorate and the Republican base really is divided. And the part that supports continuing U.S. involvement in Ukraine, they tend to be some of higher income. They tend to be more urban or suburban versus rural. They tend to be the voters in other words that are willing to move beyond Trump. So it's a risk embracing the isolation and swing of the Republican party, particularly when many of the voters who are most willing to move beyond Trump are more often than not Ukraine supporters. If we look more locally at DeSantis's so-called anti-woke policies in Florida, is there a sense that that too extreme for a national campaign? It really depends on the issue. In some respects, that might be true. With transgender rights, what our recent polling has shown is that the restrictions he's put on on transgender youth are broadly popular at the national level. That said, most posters don't see that as an animating issue for most voters in a general election, you know, economic issues, foreign policy, health care, etc. are generally our issues that vote for. Graham, thank you. An image of Vladimir Putin on his knees in front of Chinese president Xi Jinping went viral this week. So did a handful of images showing Donald Trump's supposed arrest. They weren't real. They were AI generated. What is global photo editor, Ricky Rogers, joins us for Fact Check Friday. So Ricky, can you tell that these images aren't real? What do you look out for? We have people posted where Donald Trump is and where he might appear in New York City. And we can tell, still tell pretty much that those images are fake, that they're not photographs. The quality, the digital quality of the images they're not taken on traditional cameras, digital cameras. They are too smooth. There's no pixelation, but it is becoming more and more difficult. And very soon, it will be nearly impossible without some sort of technology actually to identify those. The image of Xi and Putin is another challenge because it would have been an event probably where we wouldn't have had access. And only official photographers would have. You can only trust pictures as much as you can trust the source. What challenges then does AI present to photojournalism? The danger with AI generated images is becoming greater just because the images are so good. And they are so indistinguishable from photographs. They are not photographs because photography has a definition, right? But it becomes so much easier now to manipulate the truth through the manipulation of images. All right, thank you so much. Thank you. Now, I can't believe I'm saying this, but those are the kissing sounds of a new Chinese robot. It's designed to help couples in long-distance relationships, smooch virtually by connecting to their phones. The silicon mouths sink with your chosen partner and even warm up to resemble human touch. Voices Shanghai bureau chief Brenda Goh spoke to the inventor. Brenda, why did he invent this? So he was like student at the Beijing Film Academy. He was say that he was in a relationship at the time, but he couldn't meet his girlfriend due to lockdowns. And there were full calls, but there wasn't the physical intimacy that you would get from just the phone call. And he he decided to invent this to try and bridge that physical intimacy gap. And he says it's been pretty popular in the two weeks since it's been released 3000 units sold. Is there anything we can take away from that in terms of the state of personal relationships in China? Well, I think that speaks to how Chinese consumers are curious if they're willing to try new things. And yeah, I guess a lot of people in China do live live apart couples, you know, give a lot of migrant workers. They might be separated from their loved ones for a long period of time. I think it's really hard to say whether it's a novelty thing or whether people really want to use it the way it was intended. There've also been some concerns about the device being used for erotic content, right? The Chinese regulators really do look quite closely at erotic content. They don't they frown on any sort of like pornography or anything that's a bit erotic in nature. So so we asked and we asked Zhao about this and he said, you know, he will follow regulations like the company will comply, but at the other day, that's very little that you know, he can really do about how people use the device. Moa, Brenda, thanks. Well, that's it for Writers World News. We'll be back on Monday. In the meantime, you can find more trusted news at Writers.com.\",\"A Dutch business threatens to leave over the country's immigration policy. As the former President flip flops on a TikTok ban. It's Tuesday, March 12. This is Reuters World News, bringing you everything you need to know from the frontlines in 10 minutes, every weekday. I'm Carmel Kremens in Dublin. And I'm Christopher Walgesberg in Chicago. After the war, he made the announcement in a video address from Puerto Rico, urging Haitians to remain calm. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is in nearby Jamaica, where regional leaders from Caracom, the 15 nation Caribbean block, are meeting to discuss the crisis. Henri has led Haiti since the 2021 assassination of its last President, but he was unelected. On Monday, powerful gang leader Jimmy Cherizier demanded the people choose their leader. Holding a rifle as he spoke to journalists, the former police officer, known as Barbecue, called for the international community to give Haiti a chance. Harold Isaac is in Porto Prince. Harold, what happens now? So the formula that was adopted both by the international community, the Caracom countries and the Haitian stakeholders, is to have a seven member, transitional council, presidential transitional council, that would lead to eventual elections. It's going to be complicated. We don't expect it to be a smooth ride as these new steps are implemented. So we'll see how it goes. What are conditions like on the ground? Well, as per two UN agencies, WFP and the UNICEF, the metropolitan area of Porto Prince, the population is facing imminent famine. And as such, they're raising the alarm about the situation as gangs have attacked port facilities. And we're technically cut off from the world because the airport has been closed. So humanitarian help, an aid cannot be brought here or be accessible, which complicates the matter for people that have been in shelters, fleeing gang violence. And some shelters, people had to flee again because the gang violence had to reach them. Israel's military is checking whether it has killed Hamas's deputy military leader in an air strike in Gaza. If confirmed, Marwan Issa will be the highest ranking official killed by Israel since the war began five months ago. The first aid ship band for Gaza has left Port in Cyprus, part of a new attempt to reach a population on the brink of famine. Nigerian soldiers are hunting for armed kidnappers who seized nearly 300 school pupils in Kaduna State last week. Kidnappings at schools in Nigeria were first carried out by Jihadist group Boko Haram, but the tactic has since been adopted by criminal gangs seeking ransom payments. Air accident investigators in New Zealand have seized the flight recorders from a Boeing 787, after an incident that left dozens of people injured. Witnesses described seeing fellow passengers hitting the ceiling of the Latam Airlines flight after it dropped abruptly mid-flight. Latam is based in Chile, and authorities there have launched an official investigation. Donald Trump is reversing course on TikTok. After trying to ban the platform when he was president, he now says doing that would make some young people go crazy. He also thinks a ban would strengthen Facebook. Has Republican leaders want to pass a bill this week that would force TikTok's Chinese owners to sell the platform or risk being barred in the United States? It remains to be seen if Trump's new turn impacts attempts to pass that legislation. One of the biggest companies in the Netherlands is threatening to pull up stakes. At the center of its complaints is the Dutch government's immigration policy. Toby Sterling covers Europe's tech industry from Amsterdam. Toby, what can you tell us about this company, the ASML? So ASML is the largest company in the Netherlands, and it's also Europe's largest technology company. They're not super wide be known, but what they do is they make the equipment that's used by chip makers, by Intel, by TSMC, by Samsung to make computer chips. And like a lot of semiconductor companies right now, they're absolutely booming. They have been booming for several years and they're burning into problems with growth basically. So this is a company that has operations around the world, but probably have their employees are in the Netherlands. And maybe 40% of their employees are non Dutch. So they need a lot of highly skilled technical engineers, IT workers. They need a lot of people from outside this country in order to help build their machines. And one of the big problems that they're facing is that the government is right now making policies that are discouraging for foreign people who want to come to the Netherlands. Now, whether that's people who are already engineers or whether it's students that would like to study at a Dutch university, those rules are being tightened in order to kind of discourage immigrants from coming. But how realistic is it that such a big company would actually pull out of the Netherlands? The short answer is that it's not that realistic that they could leave or that they would leave. They have quite a large amount of infrastructure here, but they need to grow. They need to expand. And there's a lot of different ways that they could expand. So the next office that they open could be in Arizona where there's a lot of plants being built for chip makers at this moment. A lot of their customers are in Taiwan, in China, in South Korea. They could expand in other places. So it would be not scrapping there what they've got here, but more like where would their future growth be based? Are there other companies, other industries where you're hearing about this type of discontent? A lot of Dutch tech companies are having, of course, similar problems and a lot of them have also spoken out. Not necessarily threatening to leave, but saying that they're not fans of the car policies. They're very, in a way, popular with the voters, right, to say, let's raise taxes on foreign investors who want to come to the Netherlands. But I would say that the corporate Netherlands feels like there's a disconnect between what they want and what they need and what the politicians are kind of cooking up and maybe what they're even encouraging voters to demand a vote for. Trump won't spend a penny helping Ukraine fight Russia if he wins in November. And that will hasten an end to the war. The right wing nationalist leader has thrown his support behind Trump's bid for the White House and met with him in Mar-a-Lago. So how accurate is this assessment of Trump's foreign policy? Tim Reed covers US politics. Tim, what do we know? Orbn said that Trump wants to cut off funding to Ukraine because that would help end the war. Trump has not said that publicly and we do not know if that is actually Trump's stated policy. But he's definitely been very equivocal about his continued support for funding the Ukrainian war effort. And that is in stark contrast to Biden who wants to keep funding it as long as it takes. Trump has made some outlandish claims and campaign speeches. He claims that he can end the war within 24 hours. That in itself implies allowing Russia to keep the territory that it's clearly holding in Ukraine. And Trump also recently torpedoed a bill in Congress that would have linked funding for the Ukrainian war effort to new US border security measures. So what does he signaled he would do if he wins? All he said publicly is that he would get the two parties and that would be the two presidents of Russia and Ukraine, Putin and Zelensky sitting down to talk about a negotiated peace settlement. And as I said, he's also made the outlandish claim that he could end the war within 24 hours. Beyond that, he is not articulated a clear policy on Ukraine. Now the pope over the weekend urged Ukraine to consider negotiation and quote white flag, which Ukraine was not into. The president Zelensky of Ukraine and as far as we can tell most of the population in Ukraine are dead set against any sort of negotiated peace deal with Russia. Because that would mean giving up territory to Russia that Russia currently occupies and that is an absolute deal breaker for the Ukrainians. That's it for today's episode.

They were posing as refugees, but they had automatic rifles, they had pistols, they had ammunition, and on their mobile phones they had pictures of Jewish and Israeli targets in Europe. And Chinese EV giant BYD struggles with its overseas expansion amid a slew of quality control issues. It's Tuesday, March 12th. And here is the AM edition of What's News. The top headlines and business stories moving your world today. Henry, who has been holed up in Puerto Rico and unable to return to Haiti will reportedly step aside once a transitional council and interim leader are named, moves that are meant to set in motion in election as quickly as possible. Irfaan Ali is the President of Guyana and Chairman of the Caribbean Community, a political and economic union that along with the US has been calling for a transition of power in a bid to stabilize Haiti. Whatever we do must be what the Haitian people want of us. That is the important point. It is not what we want, it is what the Haitian people want of us. What we exercise leadership as a region in being proactive. However, Haiti faces a challenging return back to stability as Caribbean leaders navigate engagement with the country's powerful gangs. That is according to the US's Annual Threat Assessment, which said that distrust of Netanyahu's ability to rule has deepened and that a different, more moderate government is a possibility. That report comes as Netanyahu's leadership is facing pressure from within Israel's war cabinet, which includes rivals including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Benny Gantz, the leader of the National Unity Party, whom polls suggest would win if an election was held now. The assessment also found that Israel is likely to face lingering armed resistance from Hamas for years to come, and that the military will struggle to neutralize Hamas' underground infrastructure, which allows insurgents to hide, regain strength and surprise Israeli forces. Meanwhile, we are exclusively reporting that authorities in Europe are warning of a different threat linked to Iran and the Israel-Hamas war. Correspondent Bojan Pancevski told me that after a wave of terror attacks hit Europe starting in 2015, that were largely inspired by the Islamic State, security services in several countries are now monitoring threats coming from a growing list of new sources. There is a growing threat from actors such as Iran and its proxies in the Middle East, notably Hamas. This is what intelligence agencies are telling me. And there are a number of conspiracies involving Iranian sleeper agents who had been sent into Europe as refugees, et cetera, plotting to kill Jewish people or attack Israeli targets. Now the same is happening with Hamas, and this is extremely worrying because Hamas has never been known to try and do stuff like that here in Europe. Rather, the group has been using Europe as a hub for financing, hiding its fighters for logistics, et cetera. Now, apparently they've started planning attacks themselves, which is a new level of escalation. Bojan, I know we don't color code terror threats anymore, but just how seriously should we be taking this threat? Well, from my conversations, if there were a color code, it would be red. Late last year in December, there was a string of arrests of Hamas operatives who had been apparently dispatched to actually execute some of these attacks to target Jewish communities. They've tapped into a secret stash of weapons that was put there by Hamas some time ago. So it is quite serious. Similarly, with operatives from Iran, operatives from the IS. These groups, they don't work together necessarily, but they pose a combined convergent threat, the kind of which we haven't actually seen in Europe. That was Journal Correspondent Bojan Pancevski. Coming up. After overtaking Tesla, Chinese car maker BYD is finding that its rapid growth at home doesn't necessarily translate into success overseas. Plus we'll look ahead to today's U.S. inflation report. Those stories and more after the break. Today's U.S. inflation report will be front of mind for investors and for the Fed, who will be parsing the data for clues on where the economy's headed and what that means for us interest rates. Quentin Webb is the Journal's Deputy Finance Editor for Europe. On a core basis, CPI has seen up 0.3% this month. February overall, CPI has seen up 0.4%. This comes soon after the February jobs report. The headline figure was a bit stronger than expected, but then at the same time we had some revisions downwards. Previous months wage growth slowed a bit, so we do seem to be headed towards this point where both the labor market and inflation are in a state where the Fed feels comfortable to start cutting rates. Now, almost no one expects that to be at this meeting in March, but it could be in one of the coming meetings later in the spring or early summer. The February inflation report is due out at 8:30 AM Eastern. US aluminum producer, Alcoa, is buying Alumina in a deal that values the Australian company's equity at roughly $2.2 billion. That follows weeks of talks over an offer that will help to cement Alcoa as one of the world's largest bauxite and Alumina producers. The deal represents a bet on commodities expected to play an essential role in the energy transition and comes as the mining industry has experienced a recent flurry of mergers and acquisitions. Alumina expects shareholders to vote on the deal in the third quarter. And Apple may have ended its quest to build an electric vehicle earlier this year, but that doesn't mean that other phone makers can't take on the challenge. Well, China's Xiaomi, best known for its popular smartphones and home appliances, is set to do just that later this month, launching a four door EV sedan that it hopes will capture consumer interest. And while the announcement sent Xiaomi's stock up more than 9% today, the company will be entering the fray as leading brands like Tesla and China's BYD (inaudible) as economic pressures weigh on demand. Well, speaking of BYD, the Chinese car maker last year passed Tesla as the top global seller of Evs. And the company isn't stopping there, with its executives hoping to sell 400,000 vehicles outside of China this year. But as Journal Reporter River Davis writes, some recent delivery hiccups are showing that that target could be hard to hit. And they're coming at a time when questions are already swirling about the health of the broader EV market. River, BYD, this is a serious automaker here, having delivered more than 1.8 million cars last year around the world. It's also counted on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as an investor dating back all the way to 2008. And yet as you report lately, it's been running into what sound like some sort of elementary hiccups. BYD came onto everyone's radar for the first time last year, largely because it overtook Tesla as the largest EV maker in the world in the fourth quarter of last year. But what you have to understand about the company is that the vast majority of that growth and its current demand is within China itself, the world's biggest car market. But what we're seeing now is that it's trying to sustain that growth. The Chinese car market has been stagnant for a number of years now. BYD is now looking overseas to try and capture more growth there, and it is having some initial stumbles when it comes to that push. We're seeing that the company has overestimated demand for its cars. It's pushed quite heavily into Europe recently, and executives at the company there have flagged that demand just isn't to the level that they had expected. And on the other front, it's also facing a slow buildup of quality issues. Yeah. And you cite in your reporting a range of those quality issues, from a bus delivered to London that caught fire when it was left unattended. Other vehicles showed up in Europe with mold inside them. Could these incidents be symptoms perhaps of broader issues? First, we should definitely note that none of these quality issues have developed into a major scandal for the company thus far that would require massive amounts of recalls, that type of level of problem. They're treating, on the ground, a number of issues including mold, recoding cars, fixing scratches and blemishes. This could actually build into a really big problem for the company because this method of ad hoc fixes that sometimes works when you have a small business, but if you're attempting to scale at the pace and level that top management is pushing the company to do, then the system might fall apart. Some people are saying, \\\"We need to take a more measured approach to exporting cars. We need to understand the consumer's needs in overseas markets and standards there before we push ahead this quickly to expand.\\\" All right. So going back to the drawing board there maybe a little bit, making sure the company's plans align with the market. Though we should point out, the market is in many ways out of BYD's control. EV makers are facing some big headwinds now. Yeah. Absolutely. The past year there's been a bit of a change in the trajectory of EVs globally. So sales are still growing, but the pace of that growth has slowed in a lot of major markets including the US, China, more recently, Germany. BYD has also been hit recently. I think its market cap is down by about a fifth from summer last year. The other big issue is regulatory challenges. In Europe, imported cars have a 10% tariff on them and local authorities are looking into whether the subsidies that BYD has received through the years from the Chinese state might warrant more tariffs on the vehicles. The US also has more than a 27% tariff placed on Chinese EVs. Yeah. Some pretty big market hurdles there, River. And if that outlook doesn't improve, is it clear what the company or Beijing for that matter might do to try to step in? Yes. We've already seen this tit-for-tat. If you put heavy tariffs on Chinese cars, then we will tariff other goods. That's been going on a bit between Europe and China recently. But at the same time, BYD is trying to figure out strategies to work around these regulatory challenges. It's setting up local production facilities in Uzbekistan and Hungary that would export to Europe. And recently we've reported that they are planning to build a plant in Mexico actually. The company has come out and said, \\\"We're not targeting sales to the US at the moment.\\\" But if they're exporting from Mexico, they don't face the same level of tariffs likely as they would face from exporting from China. And of course it can just ship cars south where it's already targeting a big boost in sales in Latin America anyway. So it's figuring out its own strategies and it definitely has the weight of Beijing behind it. Because as the Chinese economy stumbles, Beijing is looking at solar panels, electric cars, batteries, as these new pillars of technology growth that it really seeks to capitalize on. And at least in the sector of electric vehicles, BYD has very much become the poster child of that push. Well, we'll be watching very closely. River, thank you so much as always. Yeah, thank you so much. And finally, companies around the world are taking on the challenges of expensive EV batteries, slow charging and range anxiety by looking to the road for answers. Regan Zane directs the ASPIRE Research Center at Utah State University where researchers are studying electric roads capable of wirelessly charging vehicles via coils beneath the asphalt. And he told our Future of Everything podcast that the technology which is already being piloted could unlock dramatic changes in how EVs are made and crucially what they cost. The vehicle would weigh less, meaning it requires less energy to move it per mile. You would have a relatively small battery, maybe 100 miles at most for most people. That means that the cost of the vehicle is relatively low. We could have $10,000, $15,000 electric vehicles. For fleets, for trucks, it's the same story, but now the numbers are much bigger. And given that installing enough electric roads to make that a reality could take a while, Magnus Vold, the Chief Commercial Officer of ENRX, which develops wireless charging systems for EVs, said that more controlled environments like factories could emerge as shorter term proving grounds for the technology. If you think about the warehouse, for instance, where you have a forklift that is going and it wants to go 24\\u002f7 and it's automated, why should it stop for charging? If you make the floor electric instead, the forklift would be able to charge while it's driving and you would never have to stop for charging. Those kinds of application in industry are probably going to take off commercially long before the EVs. And to learn much more about the potential wireless future for EVs, check out the latest episode of WSJ's Future of Everything podcast. And that is What's News for Tuesday morning.

And until then, thanks for listening. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle grilled Special Counsel Robert Hur over his report on President Biden's mishandling of classified documents, and why this is one of the most chaotic college admissions seasons in years. Counselors have said that they've never seen anything like this year, and this is following the chaos of the pandemic. Plus, slightly stronger than expected inflation in February raises the possibility of fewer rate cuts this year. It's Tuesday, March 12th. This is the PM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories that moved the world today. US inflation ticked up slightly last month, but is unlikely to change expectations that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates as we've been reporting later this year. The Labor Department said consumer prices rose 3.2% in February, marking a second straight month where inflation readings were firmer than expected. Welcome, Justin. Hi. Okay, so this was only a 10th of a percentage point higher than economists had expected. We know the Fed's trying to control inflation and keep the labor market strong. Is this a sign that the balance the central bank's trying to strike isn't quite on target? The Fed is looking for progress on inflation and this report represents a little bit of a step back. Not seeing the really cool readings that we were seeing through the fall, it comes on the back of a January inflation report that was also hotter than expected, so still the expectation is that the Federal Reserve will be cutting rates this year. Right now, people think it's going to happen at the June meeting, and that didn't change with this report, but sort of at the margin maybe we're not going to have to cut rates or maybe we won't be cutting rates quite as much this year as we thought. So the last time they penciled in rate cuts, they said, \\\"Oh, we're probably going to do three quarter point cuts in 2024. Some Fed officials might be a little uncomfortable with that, we'll get some new projections out next week after the Fed meeting, and maybe some of them will say, well, maybe only two cuts.\\\" Robert Hur, the Special Counsel who investigated President Biden's handling of classified documents testified before a House panel today where he faced intense questioning from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Hur's report found Biden was careless in keeping classified documents while out of office, but it did not result in criminal charges against the president. In his testimony today, Hur insisted the report was not an exoneration of Biden. The word exoneration does not appear anywhere in my report, and that is not my conclusion. Sadie, what were the major lines inquiry at today's hearing and to what extent did they fall along party lines? So, the questioning fell pretty predictably on party lines. Democrats said they viewed the special counsel's comments about Biden's shoddy memory during interviews as gratuitous, and they sought to draw striking contrast between Biden's handling of classified documents and that of former President Donald Trump, who has of course been charged by a different special counsel with felonies related to his own handling of classified material at his Mar-a-Lago resort. So Democrats predictably sought to show that Biden was cooperative with investigators, unlike Trump who refused to relinquish all of the documents in his possession and obstructed officials' efforts to give them back, but Republicans said, \\\"If you didn't charge Biden for a very similar offense, why did you charge Trump?\\\" So the focus was both on the prosecutor's credibility, as well as contrast and comparisons between Biden's handling of classified documents and Trump's. Sadie, we did see a couple of those details come out ahead of this hearing with the transcripts of the interviews Hur did with Biden back in October. Were there any other details that stood out to you from those transcripts? Well, it was a very interesting transcript. It painted a more nuanced picture of the President than the one that we saw coming out of Hur's report. In that interview, which was for five hours over two days, Biden tackled topics big and small, he talked about Obama era policy disputes, he went so far as to talk about his fondness for electric vehicles that he's been able to drive. At times he did stumble over minutia over details and express frustration over some of the questions that Hur and his team were asking, including about very detailed descriptions of filing cabinets and boxes and how certain documents got certain places, but for the most part, Biden seemed very animated and eager to respond to prosecutors' questions. Coming up, college applicants have a lot to contend with as they face the most confusing and chaotic college admissions season in years. That's after the break. Both President Biden and former President Donald Trump are likely to win enough delegates in the latest round of primary voting today to become the presumptive nominees of their respective parties. The results will be most closely watched in Georgia for the candidates' strengths and weaknesses with key demographics, including suburban, Black and Hispanic voters. In 2020, the state recorded the narrowest margin for victory when the two last competed for the presidency. Applying to college can be a pretty stressful time, at least if my memories of the process from almost 20 years ago are any indication, but this year might be the most chaotic, frustrating, and uncertain college admissions cycle in recent history. That's because prospective students are grappling with everything from the Supreme Court decision striking down affirmative action and admissions to changes to the new federal financial aid application, to confusion over standardized testing requirements. Welcome Oyin. Thank you for having me. Let's start with the Supreme Court decision. We've reported about how that left schools confused in some cases about how to change their own admissions policies, but what has it meant for students applying to college? So this is the first admissions cycle that the SCOTUS decision on affirmative action is actually playing out in real-time, and this has mainly seemed to affect how students feel about mentioning their race when it comes to things like college essays. I spoke to a young student in Virginia, and she's a ballerina and she mentioned that she and her friends were hesitant to mention whether they were Black or not in their essays. So, really not knowing if it's beneficial to even self-identify on these forms? Exactly. The ruling from the Supreme Court doesn't mean that colleges can't consider race at all. It means that colleges have to consider it in conjunction with other things, so they can't just admit a student based on their race. Another big change that students are dealing with this year are alterations to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. I remember this form being confusing back when I was applying in 2002, but it sounds like the recent changes made to sort of streamline this haven't made the process that much simpler. So this all comes from the FAFSA Simplification Act of 2020, which like you mentioned, was geared towards simplifying the super complicated financial aid form that most students have to fill out in order to figure out how much they're going to have to pay for college and how much they can qualify for loans and grants. So, this new form is shorter. It's online-based, it directly connects to IRS tax filings, but with that complete overhaul comes tons of technological glitches and tons of delays. So this new form came out nearly three months later than the usual FAFSA comes out, and since then the Education Department has pushed things back again as it corrects some technological glitches that aren't letting families into the form or are kicking families out of the form halfway through, or are not letting parents sign the form, which is a necessary feature in order to fully submit. So schools aren't going to be able to get the data from the Financial Aid Department on FAFSA until about mid-March or later, and that means that colleges can't give out financial aid packages until after they've gotten that application data. So, they've pushed back their deadlines for decisions to May 15th or even June 1st in many cases to give some parents and students more time to commit. How has this impacted the number of FAFSA applications? So far, there are less students submitting the FAFSA because of all these delays and glitches. 29% of high school seniors submitted the form as of March 1st compared with 45% at this time last year. So, we're really seeing this directly affect the number of students that are submitting forms. Wow, that's a big deal. As if this isn't enough to deal with altogether what we've been speaking of, there's another factor here too. At least the SAT was required for most schools I applied to, but during the pandemic a lot of schools relaxed or eliminated standardized testing requirements. Where's that left applicants this year? Uncertainty over test optional admissions policies has only added to the stresses that we've mentioned earlier. So most four-year colleges, like you said, stopped requiring these tests during the pandemic, but since then, a couple colleges have started to re-require SAT or ACT testing in college applications. Other colleges have really confusing terminology, like Louisiana State University is test optional, but students can only qualify for certain state scholarships if they submit SAT and ACT scores. Another university in Connecticut is test optional, test recommended or test required, depending on an applicant's major. So it's really complicated the system when it comes to testing, and students are also grappling with that. Should I take the SAT anyway to strengthen my application or is it okay if I don't do it? Boeing's problems are rippling across major US airlines. The company has slowed down production of its best-selling 737 MAX jets as it faces increased scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Justice Department. Southwest Airlines, which flies only Boeing planes, said today it would cut flight capacity citing lower-than-expected deliveries of jets this year. Meanwhile, United Airlines is pausing pilot hiring for two months and hunting for new planes from Boeing rival Airbus to fill the gap, and Alaska Air said its plans for the year are also in flux because of uncertainty over Boeing deliveries. Green trader, Archer Daniels Midland or ADM has disclosed that it's under investigation by the Justice Department adding to scrutiny over its accounting practices. The company, one of the biggest players in the food supply chain, says current and former employees have received subpoenas. In January, ADM had placed its CFO on administrative leave after launching an internal review. Today, the company said its review found some products sold internally between business divisions were priced at a discount compared to their market rate. ADM said it developed a remediation plan to address the issue. The company's also corrected some past financial results while reporting lower quarterly sales and a more than 40% drop in earnings compared to a year ago. And finally, vending machines have become an unlikely trending investment in the last few years and have captured the imagination of Americans dreaming of easier money. There are three million of these machines in the US, and according to the National Automatic Merchandising Association, they bring in about $525 a month on average. Personal finance reporter, Joe Pinsker, explains how candy and soda machines became an unlikely investment idea. Vending machines have a relatively low startup cost, so unlike the idea of buying a whole business like a laundromat or something, you can get going with vending machines for just a couple thousand dollars. The other thing is just that this is a pretty intuitive business model to people. Just the basic premise of you put this box somewhere, you stick some food or drinks in it, and you have people sell it, it just sort of seems to make sense. There are lots of success stories, but there are also plenty of people who really struggle with it, and a lot of it has to do with the location that you end up placing your machine in. If it doesn't have the right foot traffic, you could be in trouble. You have to invest upfront a bit in the machines that you buy. You have to then pay to stock up on product at stores like Costco or Sam's Club, and you have to pay the occasional maintenance repair fee when the machine breaks down. That's some food for thought for me next time I drop some quarters into the work vending machine for a snack. To hear more about investing in vending machines, check out Joe's full interview on today's Your Money Briefing Podcast. That's What's News for this Tuesday afternoon.

In his speech, Ariel Henri thanked the Haitian people for the opportunity to serve his country with, quote, integrity, wisdom and honor. For more than two weeks now, gangs have brought the country's capital to its knees. They've attacked the airport, police stations and jails, letting free thousands of inmates. Meanwhile, Ariel Henri has been stranded outside the country. Now he says he will resign once a transitional council is formed. He joins us now to explain what's happening from the neighboring Dominican Republic. So let's start first with what happened, what caused this resignation? So yesterday, Caracom, which is the association of Caribbean nations called an emergency meeting that included the United States Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken went to Jamaica. And then very late at night, the leaders from the Caribbean nations said they had brokered away forward in Haiti. They said that Ariel Henri had agreed to resign and that it would happen after a nine-member transitional council appointed a new interim prime minister. We hadn't seen Henri for more than a week. He hasn't been able to get back into Haiti because of the violence and we presume he's still in Puerto Rico. But we finally saw him in a video he released confirming the news last night. He said that watching all of the violence taking place in Haiti was revolting in that the government he led could not be insensitive to what was happening. He hasn't been prime minister that long. What's made him so unpopular? So Henri became prime minister in 2021 after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise. He was appointed, not elected. And he has been controversial from the get-go. Haitian prosecutors have implicated him in the assassination of the president, a charge that he denies. And Henri had also promised to move Haiti toward elections. And that hasn't happened. Haiti hasn't had elections in so long that the terms of all the country's politicians have expired. And at the same time, gangs have taken control of something like 80% of the capital. And this latest crisis was sparked by an announcement by Henri that he would delay elections until next year. That's when the gangs really got involved in politics. They used to fight each other. Now they're united. They've launched coordinated attacks in an effort they say to topple the government. All right. So gangs now getting into politics. So does this deal then now put an end to the chaos and violence in Haiti? I think that's the hope of the international community that at least it brings down the temperature. But I think the chances of that are not great. The gangs were not consulted in this deal. And whether anyone likes it or not, they are an important constituency in Haiti. We haven't heard from them. But in the past, they've said that they will not support a government imposed from abroad. Also Haiti is a fractured country. There's something like 100 political parties, but this caracom deal only takes into account seven of them. And that feeds a common criticism I've heard in Haiti about all this, which is that the international community is making decisions for Haiti without consulting many Haitians. And finally, at the center of this deal is a peacekeeping mission led by the Kenyans. That's still what the international community thinks will bring order to Haiti, but it's still unclear when that deployment can happen. Eater, thanks. Thank you, A. President Biden and former President Donald Trump don't agree on much, but they do agree that Georgia is a key state to win the White House. With your vote, we are going to win the state of Georgia in an epic landslide. Because you really want to do it again because you are going to win this primary force on Tuesday. And because we're going to win in November. The state also highlights some of the obstacles the candidates will face in the general election. And it's where they both campaigned this weekend. So Georgians got to hear from both candidates over the weekend, effectively kicking off the general election campaign. Stephen, what message do these dueling rallies send? Well, A, that Georgia is all the mine for both the Trump and Biden campaigns. And no wonder because as you may remember, it was decided by about 12,000 votes in 2020. 11,780 Stephen, how can anyone forget that? Exactly. So it's expected to be close again. I mean, look, Trump spent the last three years insisting he didn't lose the state. It's been on the front lines of the fight over the direction of the Republican Party and how Trumpy it should be. Biden won in Georgia by stitching together this disparate coalition that he needs to replicate this year from young people to black, Hispanic and Asian American voters to moderate suburban types that backed his campaign in 2020. So I'm sure at the campaign events voters expressed optimism that their particular candidate would prevail in Georgia. But what about people with concerns about each of them winning the state? Yeah. So I had two pretty clear, I'd conversations with both the Republican and the Democrat about the pitfalls the presidential candidates face in the peach state. Rua Roman is a Democratic state lawmaker and the state's only Palestinian American elected official. I'm saying, please understand there is a sizable group of people that can absolutely have your back come November. But we need you to do the right thing or else we are going to really struggle to turn out our communities because I promise you me being Palestinian. If I go tomorrow and I tell my community about for Joe Biden before we've seen a serious change in policy, they are absolutely going to turn against me too. Roman voted a blank ballot in this primary over concerns with Biden's support for Israeli military operations that's led to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. She says this pleasure with a Trump Biden rematch might lead the non-white voters in Georgia showing up less, but there's still plenty of time to fix it. All right, so what about Republicans and what they think about Trump's chances in Georgia? Because after all, this is a state where he faces criminal charges for trying to overturn the last presidential race. The rift within the Republican Party may be a little bit harder to patch, especially given Trump's track record in states like Georgia. Here's Gabriel Sterling. He works in the Georgia Secretary of State's office and has a long time player in Republican politics. In 2018, lost in 2020. The ones who, like, longed on to stop the steel lost in 2022. We barely won the House. We lost the Senate again. We lost the Senate twice because of Trump decision making and Trump endorsements. He says the voters to watch this year are the well-educated suburbanites that so far are voting Nikki Haley in the GOP primary. This is in rocket science. You can see the people who are uncomfortable with President Trump. They were the reason he won in 2016 and the reason he lost in 2020. Those are sort of the new swing voters. So if the election were held today, well, most people probably wouldn't be happy voting for either candidate. But come November, what the voters in Georgia's important demographic groups do across the political spectrum will likely play an outsized role in who wins, yes, both Georgia and also the White House. MPR Stephen Fowler in Atlanta, Stephen, thanks. Thank you. For the second month in a row, inflation is running a little hotter than forecasters had expected. Today, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices in February were up 3.2 percent from a year ago. Prices rose 4 tenths of a percent between January and February, led by rising rents and higher gasoline prices. MPR Scott Horsley joins us now with all the details. Scott, gas prices have jumped more than 20 cents a gallon over the last month. What's that about? Well, a two sure signs of spring are cherry blossoms and rising gasoline prices. This year, both of those are coming early. We typically see gas prices start to climb in the spring as the days get longer and people start driving more. This is also the time of year when refineries do maintenance and switch over to their summer blends of gas. So production tends to drop off. All that appears to be happening earlier than usual this year. Patrick DeHon, who's with gas buddy, says at the beginning of the year, we had more than 30 states where the average price of gasoline was under $3 a gallon. Today, that's down to just four states. We're getting to that time of year where March Madness also has gas prices. And we are indeed down to our last four states where the average price of gasoline is bill $3 a gallon. But I do expect that that count will probably drop to zero here for the next two to three years. Now, gas prices are still a bit lower than they were last year at this time. And a lot lower than they were back in 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine and sent the price of gas soaring to around $5 a gallon on average nationwide. The other good news is we're not saying a big jump in diesel prices as the weather warms up and demand for heating oil, which is similar to diesel drops. Diesel prices could fall further. And that's important because, of course, diesel prices can affect the cost of all the other goods that get trucked around the country. So what about the price of all the other stuff, all those other goods into inflation more broadly? Inflation has gradually been coming down. Food prices were flat last month. Grocery prices have risen only about 1% over the last year. A lot of other goods prices have actually been coming down. But we continue to see sticky inflation on the services side, things like air travel and car insurance and particularly housing. So it is going to take some relief on the services front to get overall inflation down much further. Yeah, federal reserve has been battling inflation with high interest rates. When are those rates going to start coming down? Not yet. The central bank says it wants to see more evidence that inflation is going to keep coming down. Now, the Fed is not overly concerned about gasoline prices, which normally gyrate up and down. But it wants to be sure that other prices, especially those services prices, don't continue to climb too rapidly. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that his colleagues don't want to cut interest rates prematurely and run the risk of reigniting inflation. On the other hand, they don't want to wait too long and slow the economy down more than they need to. We want to keep the economy growing. We want the labor market to remain strong. We want inflation to continue to move down closer and closer to that 2% objective. That's the economy that we're trying to achieve. And I think we're on a good path so far to be able to get there. So we're on a good path, but not quite to the finish line just yet. The Fed has a meeting this month. Nobody expects it to touch rates at that point. There is a possibility the Fed will start cutting interest rates at its May meeting, but odds-makers give higher probability to a rate cut in June. Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks. You're welcome.

A lot of people are thinking about electric vehicles right now, considering them open to them in theory, but I look at them, but I'm not going to buy them. Why not? Just because of the hassles with charging and the second thing is cost. Looking but not buying. Lots of people are in this situation and it marks a potential turning point because whether the EV curious take the plunge, it really matters. It matters to the auto industry, which is spending billions to build more electric vehicles, but also to the world because a rapid pivot to EVs is one key part of plans to fight climate change. Today we're breaking from our usual format to take a closer look at electric vehicles and not from the point of view of a specific car or the Biden administration or the latest sales data, but from the perspective of ordinary drivers. We asked the Sunday story listeners to send in their questions about electric vehicles and the response was overwhelming. After the break, we'll dig into those listener questions and get some experts to weigh in.

Camila, welcome to the podcast. Thank you so much. I'm so happy to be here and you know, I know you have a lot of questions for me, but I wanted to start with one for you because I know before you were a host, you once covered energy, you covered the BP oil spill, right? Yeah, yeah, many, many moons ago did covering the oil industry affect how you think about your personal use of oil and gas. It didn't affect my actual use, right? I know I know a lot more about it. I have a lot more knowledge of it. So I have the information. But did I put it to use not really, you know, it's just like how you made no how to eat healthy, but you don't do it. Hypothetically, hypothetically, it's the gap between knowing and doing. I think what I also know though from covering energy and energy policy for a long time is that it is a complicated issue because people have different ideas about what's best for the environment and the best way to transition. From fossil fuels. So when it comes to electric vehicles, I think there are a lot of questions about are they the solution to climate change? We got so many questions from people about this theme of, you know, the environment. What is the environmental impact of making all of these batteries for electric vehicles? Is the lithium even better for the environment or is it partly worse? How environmentally friendly are electric vehicles at this point? Yeah, I was honestly surprised by how many questions we got along this line. But people have seen a lot of stories about the environmental impact of electric vehicles, right? There's a lot of conversation about it. And I think it's raised to this question and a lot of people's minds about whether this whole thing is maybe kind of a green washing scam and EVs actually aren't any cleaner at all. So to answer this sort of big overarching theme in the questions, I called up George Beaker. He's with the International Council on Clean Transportation. And these are the people a few years ago in Volkswagen got caught cheating on their emissions tests, the whole diesel gate scandal. The ICCT is the people who busted them. So I started off my conversation with George by just asking like to be clear in terms of who you are. Like if the auto industry were pulling a big con with EVs being actually bad for the environment, like y'all would not hesitate to call them out for it, right? Absolutely, yeah, I mean, that's actually why we did the study. So he's talking about a study they did that looked at the life cycle of electric vehicles. And that includes everything mining, manufacturing the batteries, recycling or disposing of the batteries, the power to charge the vehicles, and compared that to the life cycle, everything involved in making empowering gas powered cars. But the results were clearer than we thought actually electric cars have only one third of the climate impact of combustion cars. So they are much better. Now a third is not zero, right? There's no free lunch. There's a lot of analysts told me as I was making calls to answer these questions, but it's dramatic. That's a significant difference. And electric vehicles are cleaner than gas cars, even in places like China and India where their power grids rely overwhelmingly on coal. That's the big picture, but people had a lot of specific questions too. So let's go ahead and let's dig into the details. Yes, let's do that. Let's start with this question about lithium mining. It came from our listener Austin Campon from Augusta, Missouri. I hear from a lot of folks that the mining of the lithium needed for some of these car batteries is causing ecological issues. Is this true? And if so, how does this environmental impact compared to vehicles that run on fossil fuel? Yes, so I said at the top that you can look at the greenhouse gas footprint and the difference is clear, but Austin's asking about ecological issues, which could be broader, right? So I called up the real Franco. So she's a political scientist. She focuses on the impact from these kinds of minds. And here's what she had to say to Austin. So that's such an excellent question. And the answer is yes, it's true. Yes, lithium mining and cobalt mining and nickel mining and all the mining that goes into standard batteries as environmental impacts. All mining, in fact, has environmental impact and human impacts, right? Lots of people had questions about cobalt and the child labor that happens in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And all cars require mining, but EVs take more mining upfront to build them. And real Franco, this is something she is deeply worried about. But the second part of Austin's excellent question. How does this compare to fossil fuels? A traditional car needs mining every day, needs mining every time it's used. It needs the whole extraction complex of fossil fuels in order to power it. And the extraction of the crude and the refining of the crude into gasoline is itself environmentally impactful and produces emissions and is energy intensive. And then burning that every time, you know, we turn on the ignition and accelerate the car is producing a mix of climate impacts from the emissions and then local particulate matter as well that harms the air kind of around the car. So she says if you consider all of these impacts upfront and the life of the vehicle, the mining, the pollution that goes on fossil fuel vehicles are overall worse for the environment than EVs. Though she gave the caveat that for larger EVs, the difference does get smaller. One other quick note I'll make here, Aisha, if I can, we got so many questions about cobalt. I just want to flag that there are different kinds of batteries with different kinds of chemistries. And one big trend in automaking right now is to actually use batteries that don't have cobalt. So you can go out today and you combine EV that has a battery that it's called an LFP battery. It doesn't use cobalt. So it can get complicated, right? Unpacking the different kinds of mining. But big picture. Yes, absolutely. There are impacts. But if you're comparing to fossil fuel vehicles, it's relatively smaller. Okay, so that's building the battery. But what about the disposing of the battery? Like that was what was on the mind of listener Erica Mills. Just wondering what the deal is with recycling the batteries because I always thought this was like a really big barrier we hadn't figured out yet. But my friend who just bought a Tesla said she wrote on their website that all their batteries are recycable at the end of the life of the car. Yeah, this is directly related to the mining question actually because the minerals that go into a battery don't get used up over the life of the car. They're still just as good at the end. And the more they can be recycled, that means the less we would have to mine in the future. That's a really big difference between these batteries and gasoline that we just burn and scone forever, right? Except as Erica noted, there used to be this big question mark about recycling. So I called up someone who knows firsthand what's happening with EV battery recycling right now. Redwood we can we do already today taking about 10 gigawatt hours annually, which would equate to about 100,000 vehicles a year of batteries and we can recycle those and we can recover between 95 to 98% of the critical minerals like nickel and cobalt and lithium and copper and then re manufacture those back into battery components here in the US. That's Alexis Georgeson. She's an executive at Redwood. That's a company started by a former Tesla founder to recycle EV batteries. And one thing I'll note about the fact that these batteries are getting recycled. They're actually valuable, right? So people are worried about the risk of batteries ending up in a landfill. But there's one really good reason why they wouldn't, which is that they are worth money to companies like Redwood as a raw material to build new batteries out of. I also called up the Union of Concerned Scientists because we got some questions that were asking about the environmental footprint of recycling itself. And the Union of Concerned Scientists, which obviously is not standing to make money off of recycling, but they said that it used to be the only practices for recycling lithium batteries were very dirty. But that they've gotten significantly cleaner over time and that they're still getting cleaner. So they're very optimistic about that. And another interesting thing the Union of Concerned Scientists said was actually that batteries can outlive the car that they're in. They're seeing that with some of the older vehicles where they're no longer worth driving, but the battery still has juice in it. And so some of them get a second life as stationary storage. You stack them up somewhere to store power when it comes off of a solar panel or a wind farm. And actually they can go for years even before they need to be recycled. They can last even longer than the car. So that was another interesting, interesting note. Yeah, I mean this is very interesting to like break down all these pieces of what goes into an electric vehicle and whether those pieces are environmentally sound. I want to, you know, you mentioned solar panels. We know that you got to use power to charge these batteries in the electric vehicles. And that power comes from someplace. So we got a question from Anna Lena to Nell from Austin, Texas. I know that a good deal of our electricity is still powered by fossil fuels. So how much research do I need to do on where my local electricity is coming from in order to see if it's worth it to get Navy? So your local electricity mix, it could be really different depending on where you are in the country. That's where this question's coming from, right? Some parts of the country are relatively very clean and some are still using a lot of coal. The good news, if you're a little overwhelmed with all of this, is that you don't actually have to do the research in order to know whether an EV will be cleaner than a gas car. Jessica Transick is at MIT. She has done this math extensively. And here she is summing up the takeaway. The good news is if you're interested in an EV, you can be confident that making that switch, if you're living in the US, if you're switching from an internal combustion engine vehicle is going to be beneficial. Now you can do the research to see how beneficial it will be. Transick has actually made a tool called carbon counter. You can go to www.carboncounter.com, put in your state. You can look at individual vehicle models and see on today's grid just how big of an impact it has. Usually it's got a vary between 30 to 60%, she says roughly. But across the country it is cleaner than a gas car everywhere. And that's just because it's a more efficient use of energy, putting it in a power plant and then in a battery versus a gasoline engine, which is, they're actually pretty inefficient. They waste a lot of power. So long story short, you can look up your local energy. That's great. You can research it. You can see how big the impact is. But if you don't really want to do that, you don't have to because everywhere in the country, it is cleaner today and the grid is getting cleaner. So EVs will get even cleaner over time. So okay, that makes sense for a new car. But what about if you have a car right now and is running just fine? Is it worth dumping your gasoline powered car for a new vehicle? Here's a question from Ali Maccurl from Portland, Oregon. I've been told that the biggest environmental impact of a car is in the manufacturing. So what I want to know is, is that better from an environmental standpoint to buy an electric vehicle now, or is it better to keep driving the car that you have, even if it uses gas and wait until you definitely need a new car before buying an EV? It's a super common question. I want to start with the first bit because that's a really common misconception. Actually most of the impact of a vehicle particularly a gas powered vehicle is from running the vehicle, not from building it. And this just goes, I think, to the fact that we in America, we drive so much, we use so much gasoline that it's kind of normalized. You can kind of forget how big of an impact it has. I talked to Jonathan Foley from Project Drawdown, which is a group that's focused on climate solutions. Pick up a gallon of gasoline in your hands. It weighs about seven pounds. But you take the carbon in that gasoline and mix it with air and burn it in a carburetor. It actually becomes 20 pounds of CO2 gas for every gallon you burn. So you burn one gallon of gas, driving to work, let's say, in back. That's 20 pounds of pollution you put in the atmosphere that are last for centuries, if not millennia, for every single gallon. Now do that over 15,000 miles a year. And that's why it doesn't take all that long compared to the lifespan of a vehicle to make up for the emissions from building a new car. Now that said, Aisha, Foley says it totally makes sense to wait until you're ready for a new car to buy a car. And that's not from an emissions standpoint, but just from a practical one, because cars are super expensive, right? Financially, if you're happy with your current car, it's probably not going to be a good choice to swap it out for an EV unless you have, you know, buy a car for fun money. Okay, well, it's nice if you do. There are always going to be people who are going to say, look, I mean, if the climate is at stake, should we be buying cars at all? Like maybe we should just not be doing this because of the emissions that are related to it. We got this question from Thomas Guffey of Los Angeles. Wouldn't it just be better to design cities around mass transit and use mass transit than trying to get everyone to convert over to electric vehicles? I don't know if that's a real question or not. That's totally a real question. And the answer is yes. Like full stop. That is a lower impact on the environment. I'll also note we got some questions from listeners about eBikes. Similarly, yes, eBikes have a significantly smaller impact, like much smaller than buying a big full-sized car, right? Those are cleaner things and those are also necessary, right? In order to meet climate goals, we will need to build cities so that they're more walkable and have better mass transit and support bike infrastructure. And even with all of that, we will still need cars. And eBikes are definitely cleaner than a similar gas car. And they're definitely not as clean as not having a car at all. But within the world of electric vehicles, you can also reduce the impact of buying a vehicle by getting the smallest car that you can, for instance. Okay, I mean, that we went through a whole lot just tackling those environmental questions. But Camila, stay with us because we've also got a lot of practical questions for you to answer after the break. The news can be disorienting and it can be really hard to remember how we got here. That's why we started the through line podcast. Every week, we take you on a cinematic trip into the past to better understand the present. Tunisian shrimp spaghetti, con pau, sweet potatoes, and Spanish albondigas. Those are a few of the dishes we learned how to make lately on here and now anytime. Refresh your recipe book and spice up your playlist next time you're in the kitchen with here and now anytime. Some good stories come out of Washington, but most come out of communities like yours far from the capital here and now anytime is a podcast that taps into local newsrooms from Maine to San Diego to bring you stories that matter. So Camila, you know, getting back to talking about the size of VVs, you know, one listener had a question about this. Are they in Shreem Vassen? Why are more automakers offering smaller, cheaper electric vehicles versus selling larger, more expensive electric pickup trucks and SUVs that are unaffordable to the average consumer. Yeah, so where are the cheaper electric vehicles, right? So the short answer to this is that it is easier for the automakers to make money on a more expensive electric vehicle. There's a longer answer we could talk about consumer preferences in the US. We could talk about the way that vehicle regulations work and sometimes incentivize larger vehicles. But the economics of it are a huge part of what's happening. And I will know the automakers are very well aware that there is demand for cheaper vehicles and cheaper electric vehicles. Tesla has been trying is continuing to try to make a significantly cheaper mass market EV forward recently announced they have a like a secret elite task force that's working on how to make a smaller cheaper car. But is it secret if we know about it? They just announced that they've been doing it for two years and had a tell. Okay, so it was a secret. That's a no longer a secret. Yeah, they've been focusing on this gigantic F-150 lightning and recently kind of struggling with it. So suddenly they announced they had the secret team working on a smaller vehicle. And they know that they have to do this because people want to buy them and globally there are companies in China that are making very compelling high tech popular and affordable vehicles. This is something these vehicles aren't for sale in the US for the most part because of big tariffs. And I'll note the Biden administration has recently started raising concerns about spying by vehicles made in China, which might be another way they try to keep Chinese vehicles out of the US market. But cheaper Chinese vehicles have upended the market in Europe. They are changing the way that the market works globally and really putting pressure on companies to make smaller and cheaper vehicles in the years ahead. And another thing to flag here is that right now gasoline powered SUVs and trucks are significantly more profitable for your big legacy automakers. They also know that they need to make EVs in the future. And so they are looking ahead at a few years where they're going to be figuring out how quickly to make EVs, how many of them they can sell, how much it'll cost. It's going to be messy for these companies. They want to sell more EVs, but they don't want to sell them too fast because they're not making much money on them yet. And they don't want to sell them for too cheap because again, they want to make as much profit as they can. But I mean, for the people buying the cars cheap sounds pretty good. And cars are really expensive right now. So let's talk a bit more about these prices. We got questions about whether these vehicles get the same tax rebates. Yeah, so there are big federal tax incentives for buying electric vehicles right now set up to $7,500. There might also be state tax credits depending on where you live. The federal tax credits though, they're limited to cars that are made in North America and source their battery components from the US or allied countries, which really reduces the number of vehicles that qualify right now. And so the listener who wrote in to ask about leases. Yes, leases are totally different. All least electric vehicles currently qualify for this tax credit, which reduces the cost significantly on least electric vehicles. There's actually we have a guide to the federal tax credits, which can be a little complicated on npr.org if you want to read thousands of words about exactly how it works. But the short answer is you have to qualify on income and the vehicle if you're buying it, everyone currently gets that tax credit on a lease. And on the point of prices, I will also note it is in almost every case if you're charging at home, it's going to be cheaper to charge an EV than to run a car off of gasoline. So that does save money in the long term, although it doesn't necessarily help with the upfront cost. Okay, so let's talk about charging since you brought it up. We got a question via email from rest prectal who owns a Tesla and asked about charging like what's the progress? When will we see more charging infrastructure available? Yeah, so to answer this question, I dug into some of the data from the Department of Energy called up some analysts and I'm going to start by sort of breaking down the levels of charging, right? There's level one, which is how you charge in like a standard outlet. This is actually how I charge my electric vehicle at home. It's very slow, but if you don't drive very much, it's perfectly fine. So people do that at home, we're also starting to see those chargers get added at airports where you're parked for a long time. Then there's level two charging. These are chargers that can completely refill a battery, say overnight or in the course of a work day. So these are chargers that are at places where you work, they're at hotels, that's level two chargers. And then there's fast chargers, fast chargers are the ones you use on road trips. Most people are charging their vehicles most of the time, level one or level two fast chargers you only use when you're on a long trip, but they get a ton of attention because Americans, it's really important psychologically that we feel like we can go anywhere at any time, right? This is really important to car buyers. So fast chargers infrastructure is improving. One huge thing that's happening right now is the Tesla Supercharger network, which is bigger and more reliable and faster than most other chargers out there. It's opening up to non-testless. This is a brand new currently happening situation. It's going to be complicated over the next few years with lots of adapters going out and figuring out how exactly it works. But more people are going to be able to use the Supercharger network and automakers and the federal government are also putting billions of dollars towards building more fast chargers along freeways. Now this has been underway for a couple of years. If you're an EV driver who's like, where are these billions of dollars going? Because I'm not seeing it. The money goes through the states before it goes into projects and some of it's going pretty slow so far. I talk to Nick Nigrow. He's with Atlas Public Policy, a group that is tracking charger deployment really closely. It takes a while to set up these programs. And in some cases it's taken more than a year or so to do that. But once they get going, one thing transportation agencies are very good at doing is putting money out into the field and building infrastructure. So he says, yeah, he gets it if it's felt slow, but it's going to get faster and this money, just the federal money alone, he expects to double or triple the overall size of the fast charger network. And that's not counting money from the automakers themselves. Level two chargers, these are the chargers that you use while you're doing other things. You know, if having fast chargers is really important to people who are thinking about buying an EV, having a lot of level two chargers is really important to people who have an EV right now because it's so much more practical to charge while you're doing something you're doing anyway instead of stopping at a fast charger. So this is something there's tax credits to support building out these chargers, they are being added not as quickly relative to how many of them are out there as DC fast chargers. It's not growing percentage wise as much. In a big picture, EVs have increased in sales enormously right there's been a lot of concern in the last few months about sales leveling off because the growth rate slowed. But last year sales VVs increased by 50%, which is huge. So there are a lot more on EVs on the road now than there used to be, which means chargers are getting built. They're being deployed hundreds of them every week. But they're not growing as quickly as the number of EVs on the road are growing. So charger growth needs to increase significantly in order to keep pace with how quickly EVs are selling. Well, you know, I mean, there is this idea in the US that people want to be able to get in their car and make a run for it if they have to. And so there's this range anxiety because there's this idea that if you, you know, even though, yeah, you may only go 15 miles in your day, you know, normally if that, but what if the zombie apocalypse happens, the sun happens, you got to get in the car and go, people have range anxiety, right? You know, so we have our listener, John little. He's been thinking about this, especially in the winter, because that affects charging. Here's his question. I'm in Vermont. I'm curious about the cold weather affecting my ability for the battery to charge up fully. And if I'm driving around with heat on and radio listening to Sunday story, what's that going to do to my actual range? Yeah, so cold weather does affect electric vehicle range. I spoke to Nils Sodor in Norway. He's with a group that every winter sends electric vehicles up into the mountains north of Oslo to see how they do. This is what that sounds like. It's pretty cold and miserable. He says they've done this for years and different vehicles do differently. We have tested this in the winter. The best had only 4% loss range. And the worst is 36 and a lot in between. So, you know, ballpark, you configure, you'll lose 25% of your range in the winter. It might be worse if it's really, really cold, you know, negative digits. It does vary by car. So you'll want to research that specifically how you drive a couple quick tips here for people in cold climates on the practical side. If you get a vehicle that has a heat pump to heat the vehicle, that helps a lot. It's more efficient. If you have heated seats and you can run the heated seats instead of the heater, it's actually heated seats not a luxury. It's a really practical element if you have an EV and a cold climate. You'll also want an EV that can precondition the battery, which just means warm it up before you charge it because the batteries like to be warm when they charge. And you know, if you want to improve your range and an electric vehicle in general, slowing down is going to be the thing that helps the most. If you don't speed, go the speed limit or even a little under your range will increase a lot. But the radio, please report not a significant draw of energy. So, please keep a, keep the Sunday story playing. Please keep it playing. We really need you to keep listening. This has all been really helpful to understand this growing industry. And everything you're saying, it feels like we're really at a pivotal time for electric vehicles. Yeah, absolutely. This is a pivotal moment. And it's also, I would say, a really interesting moment because we're going from a market of early adopters who were super enthusiastic about electric vehicles. They wanted an EV specifically. They love the zip, the instant torque. They wanted to not have to buy gasoline. They were enthusiastic about the technology, how quiet these vehicles are. And they researched EVs a lot. And now you have the mainstream market buyers who just want a good car and are open to EVs. But they're wondering, you know, can I afford them? Is the charging going to work for me? And as all of these individual buyers are making these shopping decisions, the industry is making its decisions about what kind of vehicle lineup they're going to have in the years ahead. You have regulators making decisions, California and a bunch of other states have mandated that by 20, 35, 100% of new vehicles be zero emission. And federally, just this week, the EPA finalized vehicle emission standards that are designed to accelerate EVs. And they moderated the timeline a little bit looking at the market right now. So everyone is looking at how these cars are selling right now to decide how fast it's possible for this transition to happen, which means that consumer decisions are kind of being amplified because they're sending a signal to policy makers into industry about what's possible. Big picture, the auto industry mostly agrees that electric vehicles are their future, but the question is how quickly that happens. And there's a lot at stake because one of the things that's going to determine how bad climate change gets in the future is how quickly things like transportation decarbonize, how quickly they go electric. So these decisions that everyone is making one by one for their families, for all their personal reasons, they add up to what's going to be happening decades from now, how expensive it's going to be to deal with climate change, how deadly it's going to be all these little individual decisions they add up to a really big collective one. I mean, that puts a lot of weight onto a decision that some people might not put a lot of thought into, which is the car that they're going to drive, but they might not think of the larger implications outside of their own driving and their own family or what have you.

Vladimir Putin says that Russia is technically ready for nuclear war. He told Russian media he sees no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, but again warned that he would consider US troops in the country an escalation. The interview comes just days before a Russian election, certain to hand him another six years in power. In Washington, the Biden administration has confirmed it will send $300 million worth of arms to Ukraine. Patricia's angerly covers foreign policy and national security. Patricia, first, where is this money coming from? This money is funding that the Pentagon apparently had. At least some of it, they said that they didn't realize they had. It was because previous weapons orders for Ukraine had turned out to cost less than they expected. The House still hasn't taken up the foreign security aid bill, which includes $60 billion for Ukraine. So how are its supporters trying to get that through? There are two main things that they're doing. One is they're just trying to convince the Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to change his mind. But the other thing that they're trying to do is to use a fairly obscure rule in the House that lets you force a vote on a bill against the will of the majority leader of the speaker by collecting 218 signatures on what's known as a discharge petition. And discharge petitions are not common, but they have been used before successfully. The Biden Trump rematch is official. In the latest round of state primaries, both picked up enough delegates to officially clinch their party's nominations. They now head to a repeat general election battle in November. A long time age to Alexei Navalny is recovering from a hammer attack in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. Leonoy Volkov had his arm broken and tear gas sprayed in his eyes, according to a colleague. The attack happened just hours after he was interviewed by Roishers. Our work is full of very complicated challenges, of an almost pressure of high individual risks for everyone in the leadership of the organization. Members of Navalny's political group, the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which includes Volkov, have based themselves in Lithuania since fleeing Russia. I did not sanitize my explanation. Nor did I disparage the president unfairly. That's former special counsel Robert Herr. Defending his report last month saying President Joe Biden had a poor memory. My assessment in the report about the relevance of the president's memory was necessary, and accurate, and fair. The hearing also an opportunity for Democrats to highlight former president Trump's mishandling of classified information, as well as his own notable verbal gaps. Andrew Goudsward covers the Justice Department. So Andrew, reporters got their hands on the full transcript of Herr's interview with Biden. What did it show? I think the transcript showed a more nuanced picture than what either side maybe would depict. You don't read the transcripts and see a president who is failing to remember really basic information or who doesn't seem to have a clear grasp on the issues in front of him. But there are certain things that came up. He struggled, for instance, to sort of piece together the timeline for when he left the vice presidency when former president Trump took over. And so it's a very kind of freewheeling interview where Biden is giving a lot of detail though at times getting sort of sidetracked from the questions that are actually in front of him. HOTTER than expected US inflation and the risk of oxide surprises elsewhere is pushing back bets on rate cuts in much of the world. But there's growing speculation that Japan will end its experiment with negative interest rates as soon as next week. Rising wages are the main driver, reinforcing Japanese spending and confidence. In Sudan, this army video shows soldiers celebrating around burnt-out vehicles after the most significant advance against its military rival in nearly 11 months. The army has captured the national radio and TV headquarters. Aiden Lewis is bureau chief for Egypt and Sudan in Cairo. Aiden, how meaningful is this latest move? It's significant because the army has made a number of recent advances in Sudan's wider capital, which this capture of the broadcast headquarters built on. It means that it has now extended its control over Old Onderman. Onderman is one of the three cities that make up the bigger capital around the River Nile. The rival RSF, the force that the army has been fighting in a war for nearly a year now, still controls other parts of Onderman. That the army has regained some of its footing in a conflict where it had been struggling militarily until now. So you mentioned, Renle year into this conflict, is there any sign we're closer to some peaceful resolution? So far, all efforts to mediate a ceasefire in this war or find a peaceful resolution have come to little and the fighting has continued. There has been a call recently last week, in fact, from the UN Security Council for a cease fire, truth, because the conflict has triggered a major humanitarian crisis. And one of the sites, the RSF, the parameter tree welcomed that appeal, but the army suggested it wasn't going to accept. So it seems like a truce or any kind of longer-lasting solution is still pretty far off. Only fans cast itself as a new breed of adult entertainment, where creators provide visuals to subscribers or fans for a monthly fee or one-off sales. Now, a Reuters investigation has uncovered more than 120 cases of men and women, complaining that explicit images of them have ended up on the platform without their consent. A spokesperson for the company says that in the few examples where bad actors have misused our platform, only fans, quote, removed the contents swiftly, banned the user, and actively supported investigations and prosecutions. And your Marshall is a reporter on the team that worked on this story. Andrew, you spoke with some of the victims. What's been their experience? So some of the women we spoke to their appearance in a sex video and only fans was truly devastating. A woman called Keisha Blaise told us how she struggled to go out in public because she was terrified that people might recognize her from a sex video that her ex-boyfriend had sold and only fans, the $15. A woman called Adrienne Apprater told us how she had to install a home security system after being harassed by stalkers who saw and only fans video of her that went viral. A woman called Sammy alleged that two men had raped her and then sold a video of the incident on only fans. She is sewing not just the men but also only fans and what might be the first case in its kind against the platform. After that happened, I was lost. A company, a songy being raped and they made money off of it. For some of the victims that we spoke to, they had a really futile fight for justice. One of them was a manned crostor. She told us that her ex-boyfriend had secretly filmed them having sex and then posted these videos on only fans. It was just, it was, it was really, really degrading. She complained to police but was told her case couldn't be prosecuted because the videos didn't include enough information that specifically identified her. Of course it's a male cop like most of them are. So I'm again just taking my sex videos and just showing them to more people for them to turn around and tell me that there's nothing that they can do for me. What else did only fans say about your reporting? Tampa police said they spent five months investigating her case but the evidence didn't meet the criteria for a criminal violation. Even so her friends got to know about the video and assumed she was now doing porn. So she felt really angry and hopeless when she learned that the police couldn't do that much. Only fans say it's building the safest social media platform in the world. It also says it moderates 100% of its content and has a dedicated team that approves content creators. But the cases with Foun suggest that there are significant gaps in that system and law enforcement officials tell us that it's nearly impossible to monitor only fans on a sustained or systematic basis partly because it's so big but partly because of the subscription paywalls that surround its creators.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a long time supporter of Israel and the highest ranking Jewish elected official in the U.S., calling for new elections in Israel. It has become clear to me, Netanyahu coalition no longer fits the needs of Israel after October 7. Netanyahu's LeCoud party swiftly rejected Schumer's proposal, but his speech reflects the growing frustration in Washington with Netanyahu. Netanyahu's vow to push into the southern city of Rafa has only increased tensions with Washington. This vitalnet covers U.S. foreign policy in Washington, DC. So Matt, we just heard Senate Assum talk about leverage. If Israeli forces push in to Rafa, how might the U.S. respond? Well, first and most importantly, President Biden and his aides have very starkly warned Israel against invading Rafa, which is sheltering more than half of Gaza's population at this point, unless they come up with a plan for protecting civilians and keeping the flow of aid going in some fashion. So the U.S. does have some leverage if they want to use it up to this point. Biden has resisted using one of the main pressure point, the main pressure point in fact, which is the U.S. supply of weapons to Israel, which relies your heavily on U.S. equipment. He has been very reluctant to do that. Another would be diplomatically the U.S. provides Israel with a shield at the United Nations against security council resolutions using its veto often or discouraging others from going ahead with different resolutions that are anti-Israel. And the U.S. could decide under certain circumstances that it might allow something to go through. That too, it has carries great risks for the administration. While Israel warns of a military push into southern Gaza, the danger of an all-out conflict along Israel's northern border has regional players concerned. And as Hezbollah found its backers Iran planned for a possible all-out Israeli offensive in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is telling Iran that it can fight this alone. The message came from Hezbollah's leader, Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah, during a previously unreported meeting with the head of Iran's Al-Quds Force. Samia Nakul is brought to global foreign policy editor. Samia, why is Hezbollah saying this? Because they feel that Iran is going to be under attack if it helps Hamas or if it unleashes its proxies to attack you as interests and Israeli interests. You know, there is a kind of escalation going on, but everybody is saying to prevent an all-out war in the region. It will be a huge regional war if it starts. It gets Hamas. Iran is already fighting there. It gets Hezbollah's attack and it gets Iraqimidisha. It gets United States and of course Iran. So actually Hezbollah is starting to take the blunt and to shield Iran in a way from an attack. What does this tell us about the strain Iran is under? Iran is coming under enormous pressure from all sides. You have the Saudi-Israel agreement that is under works. Then you have the US defense pact between Saudi Arabia and the United States, which is a kind of NATO-like agreement. So you have a new, the alignment, you have new dynamics that apply. Plus Iran fears that if the proxies carry an escalation and all-out confrontation, this time Israel might attack its nuclear program. And this is something that they really have concerned about because it will set their program back in time. So they want to take a backseat at this stage and to avoid a white-scale confrontation or a full out-war. Hamas has put forward a ceasefire plan to mediateers and the US. It includes a first-stage release of Israeli hostages in exchange for up to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the proposal seen by Reuters. Israel said the offer was based on, quote, unrealistic demands. Meanwhile, Gaza's health ministry says at least 29 Palestinians were killed waiting for aid in two separate Israeli strikes. Israel's military denies attacking aid centers, describing the reports as false. Kamala Harris touring a Minnesota abortion clinic in Anne historic first.

Vladimir Putin is certain to win in Russia's presidential elections this weekend. And across Latin America, a small but growing community of Russian transplants will likely be watching the results closely. Once the invasion into Ukraine, more and more Russians have been putting down roots in central and south America. The Sinder Elliott takes us to Buenos Aires, where one couple is hoping to introduce a little bit of Russian culture to Argentina. Ilya Nadia Gafferov, a couple from the port city of Vladivostok, they come from the very far eastern corner of Russia, a port city near the border with China and North Korea, and they have arrived about nine months ago to the city of Buenos Aires, where they're planning to open a Russian style sauna or banya. And there are others who have opened bars and cafes and beauty salons, and there's a really kind of thriving community. And what we found is that not only are they coming, but they're coming to stay. The quality data from Argentina shows that nearly 4,000 Russians were issued residency in 2023. That's up tenfold since 2019 before the pandemic disrupted international travel. And the migrants came to me from Russia. So Ilya told me that he felt that the Russian community had grown quite substantially since they arrived, and that more and more people were on their way. What I found from speaking to many different exiles is that the economic situation in Russia was a big driver, but also that changes to Russia's conscription system last year has made it harder to avoid being called up for military service. Why are Russian immigrants choosing places like Argentina, Brazil, or Mexico to find in New Home? Generally Russian sea, Latin American societies is fairly liberal, diverse, and democratic. Then you have the ease of coming here and applying for residency. Most countries you can come in for 90 days without a visa, and after a few years then you can fly for a passport, and these passports are much more attractive at the moment than a Russian document.

Washington is now planning to put forward a resolution to the UN Security Council that calls for an immediate truce in Gaza. Speaking in Cairo, Secretary of State Antony Blinken presses the case for a halt in the fighting. The need for an immediate, sustained ceasefire with the release of hostages. That would create space to surge more humanitarian assistance to relieve the suffering of many people and to build something more enduring. It's a significant departure to Washington's traditional stance of shielding Israel at the UN and comes as condemnation of Israel's attacks on Gaza grow inside and outside the country. As the US moves in on the UN, Blinken is in the Middle East hoping to broker a ceasefire with the help of Qatar and Egypt. Foreign policy reporter Humeir Apamuk is traveling with Blinken. Humeirah, how is Blinken hoping to change Netanyahu's mind? He's a veteran diplomat. He's not the kind of diplomat who uses strong rhetoric, warnings or threats. So far, his diplomacy has focused on calm conversation, frequent visits, giving a lot of face time to his Israeli counterparts. And look at the progress that's been made. A lot of analysts, critics, a lot of people around the world believe US is not making enough impact with Israel. US is not using its real leverage with Israel, which is the $3.8 billion of military aid. Biden, there has been a lot of reporting that Biden administration is now considering using that after the failure of basically convincing Israel to behave in a way that it wants. But we can say that Blinken's mission is pretty tough. Apple has employed a strategy that relies on exclusionary, anti-competitive conduct that hurts both consumers and developers.

The block is looking at using interest earned on Russian assets, frozen since the start of the war. Here's Charles Michel, president of the European Council of EU Leaders. We are determined to act very quickly, so that we can take a part of this money to support Ukraine, including this possibility with military equipment. Andrew Gray is in Brussels. The idea is to take the profits from those assets and use them to help Ukraine. So the European Union would sense take these profits and channel them into a couple of different funds. The main one is one that's been used to help finance weapons for Ukraine. The president of the European Commission has said the first 1 billion euros could be dispersed as soon as July. But is everyone in favor of this plan? There are some countries, some that are militarily neutral or non-aligned, the likes of Austria, Ireland, Malta, Cyprus. This poses some questions for them. The original idea had been to use this money for Ukraine reconstruction, which would have been less controversial. So we'll have to see if they will come on board. How much money would this raise for Ukraine? The European Commission reckons this could yield about 3 billion euros annually. Possibly also tax that the Belgians take from Euroclear, the securities depository. And that could add potentially another 1.5 billion a year according to officials. So it's a substantial sum. It's not perhaps a game-changing sum when you look at the US package, the aid package of 60 billion stuck in Congress. But officials think it would make some difference to Ukraine and they're keen to go ahead and use it. In Senegal's capital, Dhaka, families of freed prisoners gather for a long-awaited get-together. Among them, kindergarten teacher, Aramata Dijiba. She spent six months in a cell with a single toilet, shared with 40 other women. On charges, she says we're politically motivated. Aramata is one of hundreds of prisoners recently granted amnesty, mostly protesters and opposition members. The release comes ahead of tense presidential elections this weekend, made more divisive after outgoing President Mackie Sal delayed the poll. Normally, one of West Africa's most stable democracies, Senegal has faced some of its most deadly unrest and history over the past three years. Bhate Felix is our West Africa bureau chief in Dhaka. Bhate, there aren't 19 candidates on the presidential ballot. Who are you watching to come out on top? He has the experience, he's backed by the coalition party machinery. The other candidate that we are keeping an eye on is a young, relatively unknown format tax inspector called Basiryu Diumai-Fai. He came in just purely by default. He supported by Usman-Sonku. Some questions say, main candidate or was seen as a main candidate until legal troubles led him into detention and he was disqualified. So he had to find a replacement and this replacement turned out to be Diumai-Fai, who was also in detention. Both of them were released last Thursday and we've seen a huge momentum behind Diumai-Fai, mostly because of the popularity around Sonku. What are some of the big issues for voters? The key thing is the economic situation. Yes, Senegal has seen strong growth on the Mackie Sal. It's been huge investments in infrastructure. It's been fantastic, but it hasn't trickled down to the common people and on one end you can find people driving around with the latest SUVs, the Maybacks and so on. But right around the corner you have dozens of young men trying to echo living, hooking all kinds of way and not making up to a dollar a day and that is a reality. That is it for Friday.

Now we couldn't do an Oscar special without, of course, our experts. Two writers journalists who have been covering the entertainment industry for years. Rollo Ross is one of our tireless video producers. Well, I specialize in red carpets. He travels the world bringing us those shots of a list is walking the carpet. It's interviewing celebrities during award season and premieres and things like that. I edit and write all the stuff and plan what we're going to cover as well. Amazing. Lisa? And Lisa Richwin, who's been across the ins and outs of Hollywood for more than a decade. I cover entertainment, both the business side of entertainment and the creative side of entertainment. And this will be my 12 year covering the Oscars. Wow, that's a lot of years. I know I was like, should I say it? Absolutely, you should say it. Well, it sounds like I definitely have the right people for this podcast. All right, let's get into it. So we are here, obviously, to talk about all things Oscars. I want to start with what to expect from the night itself. What are we going to see on stage, Lisa? Well, Jimmy Kimmel is back as host. What do I want to bring to the table as host that is different this year? Nothing really. It'll be the same. I don't have talents really. It's not like I have a secret love for dance. He's done it many times. He hosted last year. So he'll be back and he usually gets pretty good reviews when he's the host. They'll either laugh or they won't. Then afterwards everybody will say, you are terrible. We'll have some musical performances that people are really looking forward to this year. One of them is Ryan Gosling. He'll be singing, I'm just Ken from the Barbie movie. As well as Billy Eilish and Finneas singing their ballad, what was I made for? They're both nominated for Best Original Song. Anything you're watching for, Roller? Well, I was going to just say about Wajaje, the best song, which is from Killers of the Flower Moon. That is going to be a real cultural moment, I think, of the evening. Because if you've watched the film, you see that a hundred years ago, people, both white people and the indigenous people, were speaking the same language, the Osage language. Now that language is endangered and no one speaks it fluently anymore. So it's a real cultural significance to have that performance on stage during the Oscars. How many people are expected to watch the Oscars? Well, last year there were about 18.7 million, which was up from the previous year, but still the third lowest ever for the Oscars. It's not just the Oscars, all of the Hollywood award shows have been declining in viewership for several years. I mean, by comparison, the highest rated Oscars, which was way back when Titanic came out, was 57 million. But award shows just are not that popular anymore. I think a lot of people do look at the outcomes. They look at them on social media on TikTok or other sites. I think people are interested. They want to see who wins. They want to see what people are wearing, but they don't necessarily want to sit down and watch a three hour show. No, I want it in 60-second bites, Lisa. I know. I hear you. Rollo, I'm interested. You're the showbirds, celebrity guy. You do all the red carpets. In 2022, we had the slap. 2023 seemed to manage to stay mostly outside of extreme controversy. Are there any moments, I guess, you'll be watching out for this year? Well, I think that Barbie is going to become a talking point in some senses that if it wins nothing, I think there'll be probably quite a lot of outrage. If Ryan Gosling wins for Best Supporting Actor, I think that goes kind of, as people said, during the nominations, that goes against what the film's about. There's been a lot of discussion about Greta Goa, a not getting nominated for Best Director, considering she helmed one of the most female facing films I think we've ever seen at the box office. She had so many things to contend with, including dealing with a massive franchise and a production company like Mattel. I think that Barbie will be something to watch that evening, because I think that, yeah, if it wins, it's difficult, if it loses, it's difficult. How have the cast been dealing with the controversy? So this is something I realised the other day, that apart from the Oscar's luncheon, which is the official Academy Awards event during a award season, Ryan Gosling has skipped every single official awards photo call. Wow. I mean, usually celebrities go through, get their photo taken, and then go onto the red carpet. He has skipped the photo call. I believe on every single major award show. So, I mean, he's all dressed up, but he's not getting his photo taken. And I think that that may be a sign about the feeling in the Barbie team about the nominations, that he doesn't want to put himself, he doesn't want to feel like he's gloating that he's got a nomination, if that makes sense. What about for you, Lacer? Is there anything that you're really going to be looking out for? Well, we're always looking to see if celebrities decided to make political statements, if the war in the Middle East might come up. I mean, Hollywood does like to get involved in politics, and celebrities like to speak their mind, not everybody in the public wants to hear from them, but a lot of them think they have a platform and that they should use it. So we'll see if somebody wants to bring it up. Mark Ruffalo is known as being very outspoken on a lot of political issues, so he could bring it up. Others might decide that, you know what, this is a night to celebrate Hollywood, and we're here to have a good time, and we're not going to turn the attention there at the moment. Let's get into the expected winners, and maybe also the expected losers. Lacer, some categories are a bit of a shoo-in. What are they? Well, it would be shocking if Oppenheimer does not win Best Picture. I don't know if we can be trusted. What's such a weapon? It has swept all of the awards up until now, in a way that does not usually happen again. I've covered Oscars for 12 years, and you usually have a front runner, but not in the same way that Oppenheimer is where they've won the top award at the SAG awards, the Golden Globes, the Director's Guild. I mean, all of these precursor awards that signal how the voting members are feeling, the directors, for example, vote for the Director's Guild Award. So, they're all Academy members, so they give us insight into how the Academy members are feeling. So Oppenheimer looks to win Best Picture, Best Actor, Killian Murphy, who played the scientist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, is likely to win Best Actor, although there's a lot of people talking about Paul Giamatti from the Holdovers. Me and I remind you that it is not my fault that you are stuck here. Do you think I want to be babysitting you? And he's really well liked in Hollywood. I have an inclination anyway to try to make something sad, funny, and something funny sad, and to sort of like, if there's some really inhuman moment, find the second in it that's human. When I was at the Oscars' luncheon, he got a huge applause when all the nominees are announced. So I would keep an eye on that one, but it's going to be a big night for Oppenheimer. You mentioned Paul Giamatti, Lisa. Is he as nice as he seems? Oh, my God, he is so nice. He is unbelievably charming and charismatic. And that's going to help him. I mean, this is, I mean, it's partly a popularity contest. It really is. I saw one of the trades that they're all the trades are doing these secret ballots at the moment. And some people were just like, I wasn't going to vote for Robert Downey, Jr. But then I met him and he was so wonderful that I just thought I had to put his name on the ballot, even though I hadn't seen Oppenheimer. It's like, this is what is, it is a popularity contest. What about Killian Murphy? Because he's become, I guess, a bit of a meme for seeming, shall we say, uninterested? Yeah. It's a very difficult one for me to ask. So you have to face up to the person, the person, the person, the person, the stars themselves. He's not very, let me put it this way. He's not very comfortable doing media. And I'm not sure he's that comfortable with a huge crowd of people in the way that someone like Robert Downey Jr. or Paul Jimati would be. Well, that's exactly what I was going to say. And I heard this from one of our photographers who says, somebody like Robert Downey Jr. He wins his golden globe, then he's holding him in the air and kneeling and posing and doing whatever. And Killian Murphy is very introverted. And we'll just hold this statues and smile. So he has a different personality. Do you get nervous when you interview him? I mean, it's hard to interview somebody who doesn't want to be interviewed. Well, I didn't interview with him. So the only interview I've done during a ward season with him was at the Palm Springs Film Festival. And he actually walked away in the middle of the interview. And I was like, oh, okay. What? It wasn't that I asked him, I mean, I think the question I asked him, I said, what is the thing about Oppenheimer that you're most proud about? That was the question. And he answered about forwards and then walked off in the middle of the sentence and I was like, okay. So what did you do? How bizarre. Yeah, I know, but you just have to sort of like go, but he just seemed to be struggling with the questions. One appointment Killian Murphy did not miss was his hat fitting. And Hymn's hat was central to his look and to direct a Christopher Nolan's vision. Right, Lisa? They wanted to get it exactly right because it was an important part of his image, his silhouette. And they believed the real life Oppenheimer really was intentional about his image and that he wore this hat all the time and it was part of how he wanted to present himself. So you met the hat designer, Lisa, tell us about him. It turns out they found someone very close to Hollywood named Mark Mahia. He runs a company called Baron Hats, which is legendary. The previous owner Eddie Baron was making hats back for John Wayne. And the scene with, with he was in with Humphrey Bober. More recently, Mark and Baron Hats have worked with Beyonce, Bob Dylan, Clint Eastwood, Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, all these big names. So it turns out that they sent the design to Mark. Crown with a brim that's a little bit up in the back. And Mark was able to nail it right away. Mark the hat maker also showed you a contraption I'd never heard of before. The conformer to what is that? That is a big metal contraption that they put around someone's head to precisely measure it to get the hat to fit perfectly. This lid comes down like this and gotcha. Then I squeeze it. And this is what he did with Killian Murphy to make sure it had the perfect fit. And then we have these little pin marks, right? And there I am. There's my head shape with the little marks. I mean, that's part of what it comes down to is having the perfect fit for an actor to make the character look exactly like you want them to. And I was trying it on Killian and Christopher come in and put his little flare on it just to give it the attitude that he wanted and we captured it right then and there it was perfect. So we've talked a bit about the show-ins. What are the toss-ups where we don't know what's going to happen? Oh, well, I think this kind of interest is a very interesting film because it's up for international but there's also up for best picture. It also has happy moments. The zone of interest is about the family of Rudolf Haas and his home, which is very lovely and has a swimming pool and a lovely garden and has situated right next door to Auschwitz. And so they continued this family life right next door to where atrocities are happening. So it's kind of a reminder, it's a sort of metaphor for life right now where atrocities are happening in different places around the world and people in the West or people very nearby are sitting around in luxury. So it's very much an analogy of that. There has been a lot of rumblings that a lot of people are voting for a zone of interest rather than Oppenheimer, which I find kind of, I find, yeah, it could be interesting because normally during the Oscars films are being played. There's a lot of interest in the Oscars films are pigeonholed in certain ways but since we think remember back to Parasite we've been getting more and more international films and during the best picture race. I think it's kind of the Joker in the back, I think in some ways. Lisa, what's your take on the best actress race? You've got Lily Gladstone and Emma Strenerhead up top in the bleachers. Emma Stone, among others, who's going to take that out? I think that's the biggest toss up among the major categories. Emma Stone is nominated for poor things. I am Bella Baxter and there was a world to enjoy, so I can navigate. It is the goal of all to progress grow. It's a really wacky film about a woman who's kind of Frankensteined back to life and sees the world in a different way. I think it will get a lot of love from international voters. It won a big award at the Golden Globes. Emma Stone could very well win that but there's Lily Gladstone from Killers of the Flower Moon. I ought to kill these white men who killed my family. Who has gotten just universal praise for her role. She is a Native American actress who was in the story of a Native American nation suffering through a bunch of murders in the 1920s in Oklahoma. It's a true story that is not really well known among Americans. She played oppositely in order to Caprio and he has called her the heart and soul of the film. She is really beloved. I really think it's between those two and then a long shot is Sandra Fuller for Anatomy of a Fall, which is a courtroom drama. She's in two of the best picture contenders this year but she is an outside chance for best actress. Fun fact is speaking about poor things. My dad owns a cinema, manages a cinema in my very small hometown in New Zealand. And he said people were walking out during poor things because they were just outraged like they did. They were just shocked. It's a really bizarre film and yeah, it's a really bizarre film. I really liked it. I liked it. But yeah, no, definitely, definitely. Just a touch on best director. There is one woman nominated for Anatomy of a Fall, Justin Tread. She is just the eighth female director to ever get a nomination since the Oscars began almost 100 years ago. Does she stand a chance, Roller? Not. I mean, I think the whole directing category is a very out of sync, I think, with some of the rest of the Academy. If you think about it, like Martin school says he came out with a three and a half hour film. And he was allowed to do that because he's an established director. But we don't really have any major female established directors that could you could say is with the same thing. And it's probably the same you could say for Christopher Nolan as well. So it feels like female directors are still not on the same level. I mean, that needs to change really. Speaking of diversity, there has been one change this year with a new rule coming into place around representation and inclusion standards. Lisa, what is that? What does it all mean? Well, this goes back to the Oscars, so white controversy several years ago where there was a real outcry that there was not a diversity of nominees in the Oscars race. And the Academy looked at it and noted that this is partially a reflection of whether there is diversity in front of and behind the camera to begin with. So they put in place some rules to require a certain number of diverse people in the cast and the crew. There's all these different percentages that you need to have in order to be in the best picture race this year. So the 10 films that were nominated met all those standards and they decided they were they were going to apply it to all films. But there was some complaint that, you know, partially it was a paperwork burden. You have to fill out these forms and serve everybody. And also a concern that there were inclusion standards about LGBTQ people on the crew and in the cast and a lot of people worried about privacy and how you determine that. So there was some pushback and the Academy decided just to make it apply to best pictures. So other films that are in other categories do not have to meet those rules. So you two have been very kindly giving us your analyses and your prediction. But this year, everybody can do that and put money on it. Gambling has been on the rise in the US in general since 2018 when the Supreme Court cleared the way for sports betting to expand nationwide. But Lisa, your reporting has shown that now the Oscars is getting in on that action. Right. There are seven states now where you can bet on the Oscars and it's up to each individual state to decide whether you can do that. And some states don't allow it because they don't allow gambling on anything with a pre-determined outcome. If you're betting on a football game, you know, you don't know who's going to win. It hasn't been decided yet. The Oscars are decided. I mean, the voting has ended by now. The winners are already chosen. But the states that do allow it have decided that the Academy has tight enough control that those winners are not going to leak out and that nobody is going to know until the winners are announced on state. If you want to and you can bet on, you know, you can bet on best picture or you can go to something like best sound that is more obscure and try your look at that. In Canada, you can also bet on things such as whether a nominee is going to trip and fall on their way to the stage or which Barbie outfit that Margaritabi is going to wear. Those kind of bets are not allowed in the US, not on any legal betting sites. Okay, let's look ahead to the rest of this year. What should we expect from the industry? And looking ahead, I can tell you that 2024 is not going to be a good year for movies because of the strikes. We're going to have a big celebration on Sunday of two really blockbuster films. There was a lot to celebrate in Barbie and Oppenheimer. But this year, the movies slate is thin. There are just not a lot of films coming out because of the strikes. The halted production and messed up people's schedules, you know, when the strikes ended, everybody had to figure out actor schedules and who was available to finish projects. So everybody in the industry is saying, let's just look to 2025 and they're kind of writing off 2024 as a big year in movies. I'm also wondering about, you know, there's been a bunch of flops from Marvel, like big budget flops. How is film studios trying to deal with that? Are they looking to get quicker, cheaper films done? Well, Disney CEO Bob Eiger has said that they need to improve the quality of their films and also spend less money on some of their films. So yes, every film is being scrutinized for its budget. So all those things are coming together to have Disney, which owns Marvel and other studios looking closely at budgets and the number of films they put out and reducing those numbers. Right. So a rough 2024 looks like, but even with the rough 2023, the film industry still delivered us some real moments, right? Sure. Barbie was a cultural phenomenon as was the Barbie and Oppenheimer meme that became Barb andheimer. The movies came out the same weekend. A lot of movie fans went to see both on the same day. People want to say Barbie dressed up in pink. I mean, all generations, you know, mothers, grandmothers, daughters. Guilty. I definitely did that. Yes. That movies could become an event like they used to be. And the Barbie and Oppenheimer weekend showed that still possible. This episode is brought to you by Paramount Plus.

I'm Ann Marie for Tolley. And this is What's News Sunday, the show where we tackle the big questions about the biggest stories in the news by reaching out to our colleagues across the newsroom to help explain what's happening in our world. Not to mention more expensive. There are now tons of places to stream with all the biggest players in the game like Apple, Warner Brothers Discovery, Disney, Hulu, and Netflix. And that's only from the eight largest streamers. And we're going to get to those comments and questions with our Los Angeles Bureau Sarah Kraus. Welcome Sarah. Thanks for having me. So Sarah, here's how I typically stream. First, I try to remember what service is carrying what I want to see. Sometimes I watch that show if I can find it. But often I'm distracted by all of the other options. Then I can't decide what to watch, so I end up playing a bunch of trailers. And by then I usually feel like I've watched a good amount of TV and I go to bed. What about you Sarah? I go really deep, so I like to do a full binge. If I'm going down the path, I want to go all the way down it. So I spent quite a lot of time this weekend watching feud on Hulu, the Capote versus the swans. I sort of looked at the clock after and thought, oh geez, that was quite a lot of hours. So I tend to really fully commit. I get less enjoyment out of it when I do what you describe. It makes me feel frustrated and that I'm not getting value. So I try to really decide what my mission is at execute it fully. Okay, and we're going to get into more listener and consumer habits. But first I want to talk about a relatively new trend you reported on. And so they're saying, what do I actually need? What am I actually spending my time on? And because those streamers have raised prices, they have kept the simplicity of being able to easily turn them on and off. A lot more consumers have gotten Savvier about saying, you know what, I'm going to binge this on Hulu and then I'm going to turn it off or I'm going to binge this next season on Netflix. And then I won't need it again for two months until this next show comes out. So I think much Savvier consumer has emerged and also with inflation and just the rising cost of living households are saying, how much am I actually spending on entertainment? And am I getting full value out of it? And it seems like prices certainly are a big factor, but not the only one. Here's some insight we got from Samantha Tassillo. My favorite holiday rom comes, the Harry Potter movies, the sitcom The Office. And so I pay a lot of attention to those leaving soon tabs that I see that pop up on Netflix and Max. So Sarah, what role is content playing and how consumers choose what to subscribe to? Content really is the number one thing. That is what makes consumers feel like they're getting a lot of good bang for their buck when they think about how they've spent their time or what shows have resonated. That is often the thing that dictates the decision that they make. When I talk to folks about why they've canceled the main answer is, well, I haven't watched anything there in a while or they haven't really had anything for me. So content is really what wags the dog on it and you see streamers trying to get that right with a balance of the sort of evergreen or library content that people love to return to the office, Seinfeld Harry Potter, the things that are real comfort watches, balancing that with new content, the white notices, the last of us, the things that become talkers that you want to have seen to be up on pop culture and discuss with your friends. There's just so much content though. It can feel like you often spend your leisure time just choosing what not to watch. One of our listeners, Margot Christy, says she eliminates that burden of choices. I like to call it by sticking to one service. I tend to just go to Netflix to watch things because it's extremely annoying to me to have to bounce around between prime and other options that exist. I'd rather just limit my viewing choices and have it be simple. So maybe someone like Margot can watch everything in one place? It remains really fragmented. There are certainly companies like Amazon, YouTube, Apple to a degree that are trying to become more of the gatekeepers, but there are lots of reasons why certain streamers may not want to do that. So this is really an unresolved issue for many like the smart TV screen is the best shot at a landing page, but it's not terribly searchable. It's not really the dream version of it. You know, that's why I get stuck watching all these trailers. I can't make a decision or I can't navigate to where I need to be. I've heard other solutions from WSJ commenters as well. You mentioned how some subscribe to a particular service for a month just to binge that certain show and then cancel. And then you see companies releasing episodes on a weekly schedule to try to keep subscribers on board. It seems like a sort of game of chicken who's going to outsmart whom the consumer or the streamer? Yes, there is a bit of that happening. And you see Netflix embrace more of the two part drops. So it's less weekly releases and more releasing chunks at a time with weeks or even a couple months in between. There have been weekly drops. You saw it with House of Dragons, White Lotus, other shows like that where they like the Sunday appointment viewing. They want that like busy release on a Sunday night. The people planned the end of their weekend around. So Sarah, I want to come back to something you mentioned a little earlier and I'm really glad you did because I say this over and over, but it feels like we're just coming right back to the same issues we had with cable only now. It's somehow even tougher to keep track of what's available and where at least for me. Are we just circling right back around a cable TV? In some ways, it feels like that. And also I would say the evolution of sports viewing is part of that as well. It can be really hard to piece together the full bundle of games and league access that you want to have a holistic viewing experience. And so when you start to piece all of that together, the bill really starts to climb. So how are companies trying to keep up with consumers and turn a profit? We'll talk more about how they're responding to shifting consumer habits after the break. Industry wide, the rate of customer defections rose to 6% at the end of January. That's up from 5.2% a year earlier. So, turn as we call it sort of casually is on the rise. And companies are trying to figure out how to combat that. Others have offered discounted service if people go to cancel. They'll say, hey, do you want to continue for two or three months or six months at a lower rate? Or, you know, here's a couple of free months. So you see all these different levers that different platforms are trying to pull. So let's talk about how companies are responding to such varied consumer behavior. Here's a really interesting example from Sam Rotenberg who isn't in it for the visuals. I tend to skew to shows that are more audibly interesting as I'm walking around the house. I find myself listening to shows more often than I used to instead of just sitting there and watching them. So I think this is really interesting because we're not even talking about a consumer watching habit. We're talking about listening. It's on such a wide range of consumer behavior and how we're not only seeing and viewing, but listening too. Yeah, this is a real area of interest for them in understanding when and how consumers are using their service. That it's not as obvious as I throw it up on my living room TV screen. For some people, you know, increasingly I've heard lately they listen to Netflix when they're going to bed. That it's something that helps them fall asleep at night. For young people, there's often multiple screens involved in multiple forms of entertainment happening at once. So really understanding the way in which consumers are accessing this is important for streamers to understand the utility of their services and who is more likely to churn versus stay because the service has become part of their daily lives or not. Looking forward and shifting gears just a bit, Sarah, one of our commenters, Robert Strine said, teenagers might not even be watching these services soon. Is that a concern for streamers or are the kids these days going somewhere else? Yeah, the kids do get their entertainment in a lot of other places. That could be YouTube. It could be Twitch. It could be Roblox. It could be video games and virtual worlds where there's deep engagement, a lot of time spent, a lot of live friend connections. I don't think it's a coincidence that Netflix is pushing into gaming. It's yet another offering and another way to keep people coming to their platform. So there is real competition for attention, particularly among the young people that are the next generation of Netflix subscribers. We've also seen what I think looks like more consolidation in this space. Do you think we're likely to see more consolidation? Yes, we are absolutely in the phase of consolidation and bundling. So you've seen a lot of rival streamers do bundles sometimes for just their ad tiers of service where consumers can get two services, basically, for a lower rate than if they were to pay for each separately. So that's acknowledgement that cable is in decline. So these conversations are happening industry wide now. How do we form partnerships that are mutually beneficial? I would say at a high level, we are still very much in flux. A lot of these companies are dealing with legacy cable businesses that are in structural decline and their fortunes are changing much faster than expected. And it's something that a lot of companies are grappling with. Netflix is really the most profitable and successful streamer at this point. It doesn't have a legacy cable business. It's really leaned into the advanced tech and algorithm that's good at predicting what people like. They've executed the password sharing crackdown. They've been able to roll out the ad tier. Netflix is on pretty good footing. And when you look at its share price relative to other studios, it's like off to the races and really is had a strong showing. Whereas Disney, Warner and Paramount are the entertainment companies that are really struggling with those legacy cable businesses. They have studios that they're still working to turn out hits that do well at the box office. So there's a lot of structural and competitive shifts that they are dealing with in this moment. Sarah, thank you so much for joining me. Thank you. And that's it for what's news Sunday, March 10th.

Haiti has a checkered history of constant occupation and invasion from the Spanish, the British, the French, to the Americans. Plus, here's a stabilization force from the United Nations. All of this is contributed to the problems we're seeing Haiti now. For the last two weeks, the country has been racked by violence and political instability. International discussions are focused on how to stabilize a nation that's effectively on its knees. And Perisator Perralto joins us now from Cap Haitian. Aitor, thanks for being with us. Good morning, Scott. Tell us about the people with whom you have spoken. They must be getting very weary. You know, I think weary is not strong enough word. And I'll give you one example. I was talking to Jasm\\u00e9 Fafa, an employee of a bus company here. And the routes to Port-au-Prince have been suspended because gangs have taken over the highway. But they're about to try to send their first bus out tomorrow. And the price has gone from about 300 Haitian goards to 800. And that's not because of inflation. But because of the many bribes that gangs are now demanding along the route. Let's listen. If we're not going to pass the road, we'll be able to go to the other side. It's not the reality. The fact that it's like that, we're somewhat accepted, but we don't like it. Because we're not really living. I've heard that so much here, Scott. Like, we're not really living. Fafa said they don't know when the gang can open fire on a bus. But it's so much more, he said. There's no water, no electricity. Everything is more expensive. This is not a life, he says. Who or what kind of leadership might then try to preside over Haiti? I mean, the Jocelyn for the for power has begun. The political parties in the country have started naming members to that commission, Karekham, which is the organization of Caribbean states, said a majority of the 9 parties had presented nominations. But at the same time, after what seemed like a law in violence, the gangs have responded by launching renewed attacks in Port-Aprince. Earlier this week, they attacked the airport again. They burnt down the house of the police chief. And last night, local news in Haiti were reporting heavy fighting in Bas del Mas. And this is an area completely controlled by a federation of gangs, including the gang of Jimmy Cheris\\u00e9, who is known as Barbecue. And he is one of the Haiti's most notorious gangsters. Local news reports that they were trading fire with police throughout the night. Hey, there. How does Haiti expect to restore any kind of security in the country? You know, this is one of the biggest challenges. With no government in place that you want to prove the Kenyan peacekeeping force, but that has been delayed over and over. And yesterday, the President of Kenya, William Ruto, added yet one more hurdle to the deployment. He said that the Kenyan peacekeepers will not deploy until the country has led a, quote, reconnaissance mission so his police would be adequately informed and prepared for deployment. So we don't know when that will happen. And Persever Perolta, and Haiti, thank you so much for being with us, Hader. Thank you, Scott. Nathan Wade, the top special prosecutor in the Georgia State case, against former President Donald Trump, has stepped down. That's after a judge's decision that either he or district attorney, Fanny Willis, had to leave the case because of a perceived conflict of interest. The two had a romantic relationship while working on the case. And if you're a senior political editor and correspondent, Domenico Montenoro joins us now. Domenico, thanks so much for being with us. Hey, there's Scott. Great to be with you. Of course, Donald Trump and allies face criminal charges for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, does the departure of the special prosecutor affect the underlying case? Well, it means that the case can continue. That's the first and most important thing, I suppose. But it's really been such a delay that really the DA, Fanny Willis is really fighting the clock here. You know, they've spent two months on this side motion, this hearing about her ethics in this case. And Trump and his co-defendants may even appeal. This is a really widespread, rico case. It's a lot of defendants. It's really hard to get it all done in time for the November election. And Trump's team, as we've seen, has been very effective at drawing these trials out, trying to push them over the edge for the November 5th election. And it's really not cleared all that this case is even going to get to a trial before November. And really not at all what politically Democrats thought that they would be seeing when it came to these four criminal trials against a foreign president Trump. Of course, Domenico, Trump and Biden, definitively won enough delegates to become their parties' presidential nominees this week. You've been looking at third party candidates. What do you see? Yeah, I really think that third parties may be the key to this presidential election. Because, you know, foreign president Trump didn't get above 47% in either 2016 or 2020. He got, he won at winning in 2016 when the third party vote was more than 6%. He lost in 2020 when the third party vote was less than 2%. So, you know, it really opens up a path for Trump because he has such a strong base of support. Whereas, President Biden is fighting on a couple of fronts here. He's fighting his left flank who is not happy with him, progressives on a lot of different things, in particular, or younger voters when it comes to his handling of the war in Gaza. And then you have these third party candidates like, in particular, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who polls had shown it wasn't clear who he would pull from. And still is sort of showing some of that. But when I talked to the campaign earlier this week, I was struck by the issue said that they're running on. And we're talking about, you know, being anti-corruption, anti-war, pro-environment. Those are all very progressive policy sets. And when one of his spokespeople talked to me about the kinds of people they're seeing at these rallies, young people, they pulled best with people under 35. And they said they've been hearing from a lot of liberals that they who were Bobby Furious and are now, quote, Bobby Curious. And that's really interesting because he's not running on his false vaccine platform, where he believes that vaccines were, you know, our big problem. He's running on these other things which really could pull from Biden. And of course, we'll mention Professor Cornel West, Dr. Gilles Stine, also running. Former Vice President Mike Pence said yesterday he can't endorse Trump. How damaging might this be to Donald Trump? Well, probably not much. I mean, you know, Pence represents sort of an old guard. And, you know, the never-trump movement sort of needs a dam in the river. And this is more of a pebble. And, you know, Pence didn't make any mention of January 6th, only that Trump is not conservative enough, unlike the way that they had governed over four years. When really nothing's really much changed with Trump. Is there a calculation here? Yeah, I thought it was really interesting with how President Biden responded to that, essentially saying that this was a good speech. And when you think about what Schumer might be doing here, you know, he is somebody who has been an ally of Israel and of Netanyahu for a long time. So for him to come out this way might be a little bit of cover for Biden as with what we were talking about, with Biden needing to shore up some of his left flank. And because Biden hasn't been able to really change the calculation in Israel for them to pull back with how they're approaching the war on Gaza. Dominican Martinaro, thanks so much. You're welcome. The US, Egypt and humanitarian groups have cautioned against such an invasion saying it would create an even bigger humanitarian catastrophe. And here's Fatmah Tennis joins us now from Jerusalem. Fatma, thanks so much for being with us. Hi, Scott. Thank you for having me. What is known about Netanyahu's plans? So following a war cabinet meeting yesterday, Netanyahu said the military would move forward with an invasion of Rafa where nearly 1.4 million Palestinians are crammed in after being displaced from other areas. Netanyahu said that the military was also preparing to evacuate most of that population to what he called humanitarian islands in the middle of the Gaza Strip. Now, there's been a lot of international pressure on Israel to refrain from invading the south, but Israel says Hamas is still active there and it's unclear when this invasion would happen and also the exact details of what these humanitarian islands would look like. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said yesterday that the US wants to see a clear and implementable plan for a Rafa invasion that would get civilians out of harm's way and also see that they have shelter, food, and medicine and that the US has not seen such a plan yet. Scott, this announcement was also seen by some as a bargaining chip for possible ceasefire negotiations. Fatma, how are Senator Trump's comments criticizing Netanyahu and calling for early elections in Israel being received there? Well, it hasn't really gone over so well, especially with the political leadership here. Benny Gantz, Netanyahu's political rival, you know, polls show him as winning if an early election where to happen. And he said that external intervention in Israel's domestic affairs was unacceptable. Israel's ambassador to DC, Michael Herzog also called the comments counterproductive. Of course, the US is still continuing its unconditional military aid to Israel. One thing that's important to remember, Scott, is that, you know, even as there are many people in Israel also calling for early elections to Aus Netanyahu, the majority of Israeli public support some of Israel's war policies such as eliminating Hamas and also don't want to see humanitarian aid flowing in Tagaza. And Fatma, what about that aid? First arrived yesterday by CIA, gather? Yes, that was the world central kitchen, which is prepared 200 tons of aid. It's been shipped from Cyprus. And Scott, you know, it's still a trickle compared to what's actually needed. Yesterday, UNICEF came out with a report that said that the number of children with acute malnutrition in Gaza had doubled in just one month, and that it's spreading fast and unprecedented levels across the Gaza Strip. They're warning of severe wasting among older children as well, and highlighting the need for immediate and consistent access to nutritious food. And aid groups say that these searouts and the air drops, while helpful, just won't get it done. Here's Karen Donnelly. He's ahead of crisis response for the International Rescue Committee. Air drops are completely unnecessary in Gaza if two conditions can be met. If the obstacles to bringing aid in by road can be lifted, and if the fighting can stop. And those two things are entirely within the power of decision makers in the Israeli authorities and their international partners to bring about. Now, age groups say that Israel has to allow more aid in by land, and so far, there's still only one Israeli border crossing with Gaza that's open. And fierce fight, Maitanis in Jerusalem.

It took weeks for them just to claim his body from prison so how can he be laid to rest? A Palestinian man survived a chaotic scramble around trucks delivering food and Gaza. I was left lying on the ground for two hours because there were so many injured. What does the violence reveal about the desperation of people living under fire? Also scientists are cloning pigs and growing them just to produce organs to transplant into people. It's no longer a science fiction experiment, it's actually reality.

Allys of Alexey Navalny say the late Russian opposition leader will be laid to rest near his home in Moscow today. The announced funeral comes two weeks after Navalny's death on their mysterious circumstances in an Arctic prison colony and a standoff over his burial. Navalny's widow, Yulia says her husband was murdered on the orders of Russia President Vladimir Putin, a charge that Kremlin denies. Here she is speaking this week in front of the European Parliament. My husband will never see what the beautiful Russia of the future will look like, but we must say it. And I will do my best to make his dream come true. They will fall and the beautiful future will come. Thank you. Where are you exactly? You know I'm in Madinah. This is in southeastern Moscow. This is the neighborhood where Alexey Navalny lived with his family, with his wife Yulia and his children he raised there. And it's also where he made his name and opposition politics going up to the ranks of initially an anti-corruption campaigner here in Russia against state companies and later becoming really the leader of the opposition over the past decade. And what is happening in that neighborhood exactly? Well that's really the question. Alexey Navalny's family says that the Russian government has repeatedly thwarted efforts to organize memorial service they hope to hold here today. They say authorities initially delayed the release of Navalny's body, then pressured the family to hold a private ceremony out of the public eye and even prevented them from renting any facility in Moscow that might be an appropriate place for a mass memorial. So instead we're here in Madinah. This is near a North-Edox church where not far from Navalny's home. This will be followed by a burial at a nearby cemetery and yet even that may prove problematic. Why would that be? Well again this is coming from Navalny's political team. They say authorities are now threatening the funeral services company that's supposed to bring Navalny's body to this church for the service. So we don't really know yet if this funeral will actually happen but I can tell you what I've seen so far. There's a heavy security presence here. Police have cordoned off the church with steel fencing where mourners hope to pay their final respects. There are dozens of police fans nearby and riot police and steel fencing along this route across a bridge that leads to the cemetery as well. I should add that you know Navalny's immediate family is wife Julia, his children are not expected to be here today simply because it's too dangerous for them. Navalny's parents however are still in Russia. In fact you might recall it was Navalny's mother, Ludmila Navalny, who spent that grueling week in the Arctic Circle fighting the authorities to retrieve her son's remains and that brings us to this point. What is the Kremlin Putin side saying about this? Well the Kremlin you know it insists there's it has no interest in these proceedings at all. Putin hasn't said a word about Navalny since his death but you know keep in mind the Putin never spoke about Navalny when he was alive. It was part of a strategy to treat him as a political non-entity here. Yet police actions would appear to tell a different story. We saw several hundred Navalny supporters detained for merely attending these makeshift memorials in the days after Navalny's death. And now the question today is how many more could face arrests for just attempting to attend this final send-off? The Moscow authorities they haven't issued orders for bidding people from attending the church service but it certainly seems like they're doing everything possible to make sure this funeral doesn't turn into something resembling a protest. Charles thank you. Thank you. Sometimes a single image gets across the scale of devastation in Gaza like one of the that you see from overhead showing whole neighborhoods destroyed as Israel responds to last October's Hamas attack. Sometimes though a single incident gets across the desperation of those still alive. One came yesterday when hungry people rushed to trucks distributing food in two locations. Palestinians say more than a hundred people were killed. They say Israeli troops opened fire on the crowd. Israelis contend their troops fired weapons to defend themselves and many of those killed were trampled or run over. Hi there, Jane. Hi Steve. How if it all can you verify what happened here? It's really difficult. It's just hard to get reliable information from Gaza. And one of the reasons for that is Israel bans foreign journalists from there. Unless you're with the Israeli military for instance it's impossible to get in and report what's happening on the ground. We did speak with one of the survivors at my del Haj salim who's in hospital in Gaza City. He said he was waiting for an atruck in the hope of getting some food for his three children when he was shot in the leg and then the hand. I was left lying on the ground for two hours because there were so many injured. Then after two hours there came a cart with a horse and it was then that he took me. You can see from satellite images or possibly drone images released by the Israeli military people completely overwhelming trucks. There's so little food reaching Gaza it just speaks to the desperation of people who have no other way of feeding their children. It's also worth noting Steve that the Israeli military said the trucks were operated by private contractors as part of an aid operation that it has been overseeing. UN agencies which would normally deliver aid say Israel is imposing severe obstacles to access. And I want to understand those obstacles a little better because you have people around the world including in the United States who contend that they would like humanitarian aid to be reaching Gaza. Why isn't that happening? Well according to aid officials there are few reasons. One is we have to remember Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth. And for the past 16 years it's been under siege with access controlled by Israel and to some extent Egypt. Israeli air strikes over the course of the war five months of it have damaged or destroyed most of Gaza's infrastructure. But really the main reason is restrictions by Israel on aid crossing into Gaza. Before the war 500 trucks a day entered with food and basic supplies. And that's down to as low as a couple of dozen now some days. Those main UN agencies which would normally take the lead are unable to do that now due to security and political factors. What are some aid routes that are working? Well yesterday I went with the Jordanian military and one of their air drops over northern Gaza. Jordan has taken the lead on air dropping aid with participation from some other countries. Those drops require a lot of coordination including from the Israelis. And yesterday was the first time in many weeks that aid was dropped into northern Gaza. Having said that, they're generally considered a last resort because of the expense, the logistics and the fact that they can't carry as much as trucks. Save the children aid groups CEO Yanti Soropto says Israel needs to open the other existing land crossings to allow an aid. We get the intent of people and we welcome that attempt to get more aid in the Gaza. The fastest most effective most efficient way to do it is to open up more crossings. In the meantime though, aid officials say even more children are at risk of starving to death. And Piers Janeraf, thanks so much. Thank you. Science is stranger than fiction. Yeah, give this scientist have started cloning genetically modified pigs with organs designed to be transplanted into people. And PR Health Corresponder Rob Stein recently became the first journalist to tour one of the research farms breeding these creatures. Hi there, Rob. Morning Steve. I don't know. Should I say congratulations? Well, it was definitely a very interesting experience. I have to say that. Okay, so what are they doing and where? So I can't say exactly where the farm is located. The company that runs it, Rivercore asks me not to for security reasons. But it's in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains near Rivercore's headquarters in Blacksburg, Virginia. And before heading to the farm, I watched as company scientists edited the DNA and pig skin cells in the lab and then fuse those cells with pig eggs to create cloned pig embryos. The company then implants them in the wounds of adult female pigs to give birth to cloned genetically modified piglets. Which grow up to be independent animals more or less? Yes, exactly. And that's where the research farm comes in. Four months after the cloned pig embryos are implanted into adult female pigs, they give birth to cloned piglets each with 10 identical modifications designed to make their hearts, liver, kidneys and other organs compatible for transplantation into people. David Ayers, who runs Rivercore, hooked me into a barn to see some of the newborn cloned piglets. Every cell in the body of this animal has those same genetic modifications. If you want, you know, you can hold one. Yeah, that'd be great. Okay, what's it like to hold one? Well, you know, it's the first time I've ever held a little piglet and he was really cute and cuddly, very solid but soft, but kind of squirming. It couldn't wait to get back to his bond to continue feeding. But he's part of this experiment. That's right. And the company actually has already started testing organs from these pigs in baboons. And in the bodies of people who have been declared brain dead, surgeons have even implanted two pig hearts into men who had run out of other options. What questions does this experimentation raise? Well, you know, see, this kind of thing has raised some fears, you know, about accidentally spreading some dangerous pig virus to people and about sacrificing thousands of the genetically modified pigs just to harvest their organs. Sid Johnson is a bioethicist that's SUNY, Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. And I talked to her about this. They're treated like machines for the sole purpose of being disassembled to provide spare parts for humans. And I think the hubris of a human created built for purpose animal should really give us pause. Now see, he he errs argues that the company treats the animals humanly and he says, you know, if U.S. slaughter's millions of pigs every year for food, I would argue that this is a, you know, a higher use for these animals. Certainly, I think a higher use than using these animals for food. The company envisions a day not too far off when farms scattered around the country are breeding herds of the genetically modified clone pigs to supply organs for transplant patients. And PR Health correspondent Rob Stein, the story we can't hear anywhere else. Rob, thanks so much. You bet Steve. And that's a first for this Friday March 1st. I'm Steve Innskipe.
