This new law is pushing Apple to open up parts of its closed app ecosystem. So in the EU, users are going to get a screen that says, hey, do you want to use Safari? Or do you want to use any of these other browsers? Plus, Chinese exports surge as the West ready's tariffs to stem a flood of cheap goods. And the US sounds the alarm over the situation in Haiti as warlords threaten to take over the country and trigger mass migration. It's Thursday, March 7th. I'm Luke Vargas for the Wall Street Journal and here is the AM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories moving your world today. The world's largest tech companies will soon be waking up to a new regulatory landscape in Europe as the EU's digital markets act begins to apply to them at midnight tonight. The sweeping law is aimed at boosting competition from smaller companies. Those journal tech reporter Sam Schackner told me one of its biggest near-term impacts could be on the rival reap between Apple and Google. This new law is pushing Apple to open up parts of its closed app ecosystem, which is really one of the cornerstones of its business model. It's going to be allowing third-party app stores for the first time, at least in the EU, and it's going to start allowing alternative ways to do in-app payments across the EU. These are two things that the company really was loathed to do. They lobbied against the third-party app stores, calling it a huge security risk. On the flip side, you have Google, which already allows you to use alternative app stores. It already allows you to install apps not through their Play Store. In fact, Google actually lobbied for this requirement to be put into the digital market act. Sam, there are some other ways that Google could benefit from this law. Totally. Google actually could take advantage of an element of the law that requires companies like Google and Apple to give users a choice for competing services in certain areas. One of them is web browsers. If they offer a web browser, they have to allow a choice for competing web browsers. In the EU, users are going to get a screen that says, hey, do you want to use Safari, which is Apple's default the browser they make, or do you want to use any of these other browsers? Google's Chrome browser will be on that list. It's possible, or even likely, that they'll pick up a slightly higher percentage of Chrome browser users in the EU on iPhones. Meanwhile, in Washington, House lawmakers have introduced legislation that could ban TikTok in the United States. If its owner, Chinese internet company Bite Dance doesn't divest itself from the video sharing app. The bill's Republican backer said that America's foremost adversary had no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States. While its Democratic backer described the bill as giving the President tools to defend American security and privacy. A TikTok spokesperson said the bill would trample on First Amendment rights and affect its 170 million American users. Earlier attempts by lawmakers to ban TikTok haven't come to fruition. China has kicked off 2024 with a surge in exports, setting it up for a backlash from Western economies. The 7.1% rise in exports in January and February, top-to-cottomest expectations and follows a much weaker 2.3% export growth reading in December. The data comes as Republican senators earlier this month proposed new tariffs on Chinese-made cars in order to stop what Florida's Marco Rubio described as Beijing's attempt to, quote, flood the U.S. market with artificially cheap vehicles. However, as journal reporter Ben Dumbett explains Beijing isn't likely to curtail those exports as it hopes to hit ambitious growth expectations of around 5% that it's set this week. Yeah, no doubt the latest numbers are impressive. Export activity has been up and down during COVID, it was particularly strong but slow dramatically as the world reopened. That said, this recent evidence of return of growth and export activity won't be enough, even if it continues. Domestic demand for goods and services also needs to strengthen simply because Chinese economy is so big that it can't rely on one source of demand alone. And that one source of demand may also weaken again in March with Chinese officials issuing a warning that exports are likely to soften this month. A Hoothy attack on a Barbados flagged ship off Yemen yesterday has killed three people on board according to the ship's owner. It marks the first loss of life on a commercial vessel since the rebel group began attacking ships in the Red Sea region in late November, upending the shipping industry's ability to travel through one of the world's busiest waterways. And that unrest is also now threatening key internet cables with the majority of internet traffic between Europe and East Asia running through the Red Sea. Telecom's reporter Drufits Gerald says that although the narrow street has always posed risks for telecom infrastructure, one recent attack by Iran-backed Hoothies managed to meaningfully worsen web service in India, Pakistan and parts of East Africa. There were at least three cables that were cut last month. One of the companies responsible for these cables said that their expectation is that they will be able to start repairs in April at the earliest. Of course, that timeline could change because the area is subject to rocket attacks frequently. Any ship going out there for repairs will need permits from the country where it is doing the work. Now Yemen is the midst of a civil war, so it will need permits not only from the Hootie government, but the internationally recognized government that holds the rest of the country. So that is going to be a consideration that these cable repair ships are going to have to think about as they enter these dangerous waters. Another aspect is just insurance is extremely expensive and fixing those cables is not something that's done in a day. The majority of internet cables around the world lie at the bottom of the sea with land installation posing far greater risks and costs. The Prime Minister of Haiti is facing mounting pressure to step down and call for elections as warlords threaten to take over the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation. The regional efforts signal rising concern about Haiti's security situation and the potential that escalating gang warfare there could spark mass migration out of the country. Yesterday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller directed this appeal to Prime Minister Ariel Henri. We are not calling on him or pushing for him to resign, but we are urging him to expedite the transition to an empowered and inclusive governance structure that will move with urgency to help the country prepare for a multinational security support mission to address the security situation and pave the way for free and fair elections. Henri has thus far resisted calls to set up a transitional government or hold new elections. Back in Washington, House lawmakers are closing in on the end of a months-long fight over funding the government after approving a package of six spending bills. That move completes the budget process for a slew of federal agencies, including the agriculture, justice, transportation and interior departments, and sets the stage for final negotiations over the rest of the year's budget. The spending package agreed to yesterday is expected to receive a Senate vote by week's end. And President Biden is today set to propose raising taxes on large companies as part of several announcements expected in his State of the Union address. The plans include raising the corporate minimum tax from 15 to 21 percent and could make tax policy a major contention point in the coming election. Many of the tax cuts signed into law by Republicans in 2017 are set to expire at the end of next year, with Biden calling those tax cuts in unfair giveaway to Americans who can afford to pay more. While Republicans say the 2017 tax law has been an economic success.

It's just that easy. Investors are pouring money into Scandinavian countries more than anywhere else. A new report from the Melcon Institute has found that Denmark is the most attractive country for foreign direct investment on a per capita basis, followed by Sweden, Finland, and then the United States in fourth place. So why is the world's largest economy not attracting the most investment? Our Kate Bullivan spoke to Maggie Sweetech, lead author of the Melcon Institute's Global Opportunity Index, which looks at which economic and financial conditions will foster and attract FDI. Maggie, before we look at how the U.S. performed, what is it about Denmark that makes it the top country for people to invest in? So in the case of Denmark, it really is a country that is benefiting from a very strong business perception and from strong economic fundamentals. And so focusing on this other category, economic fundamentals for a moment, this is a category in which we include three different subcategories, work for talent, economic performance, and a future environment for growth. Measures that are related to the ESG type of concerns that investors had had in recent years. So agricultural land, air pollution, carbon emissions, also factors related to governance and inclusivity, social inclusivity, mobile broadband subscriptions, mobile phone subscribers, percentage of woman and government. And those are all indicators that are included in the future environment for growth. And then Mark and Finland and Sweden actually all do quite well in that particular subcategory. And that is really what tends to prop them up to the top of the index. That's super interesting. And on the other hand, the U.S. came in at fourth place. Why is that? It's also be clear in recent years, FDI to the United States has actually increased. It jumped around 30% in between 2018 and 2022. So it's doing well. When it comes to things that could do better, I would say that it's really these economic fundamentals where the United States tends to perform slightly less than the average advanced economy. The economic performance, it's really it's a high central government debt that is driving the country down and indicators in terms of factors such as the future environment for growth, the CO2 emissions remain relatively high in the United States, which is a factor that tends to drive it down. So these are still aspects that the United States could improve, but it is still attracting significant capital investment. So the countries that attract the most FDI are consistently advanced economies, but your report also revealed an interesting shift in investment flows into emerging and developing economies. What we see is really in recent years, there has been a movement of capital into Latin America. And really there's two countries that capture more than 60% of foreign direct investment in flows into Latin America and those are Brazil and Mexico. And that is because Brazil, it has a relatively strong foreign emerging country financial services sector and in particular high financial access for its population. In the case of Mexico, it really benefits from both its geographic location, it's border with the United States, but it also actually is one of the emerging and developing nations with the strongest economic openness. It's by the other investment treaties that have really allowed capital to enter the country. Okay, so China was weighed down the list at number 39. What does this tell us about how China is performing on the global stage? Being a number 39 for a country that remains according to the IMF classified as an emerging and developing economy is actually not that low. However, what I would say about China is that certainly in recent years in the post-pandemic period, there has been a decrease in capital inflows into China. So in 2022, for the first time, more capital exited China than entered. And that in general, drove down the capital inflows into the entire emerging and developing Asian region that may not become a long-term pattern. But for now what we are seeing is this short-term movement moving away from China and into Latin America. Okay, Maggie. So what are the lessons learned here? So institutions matter having a strong institutional framework matters, having strong economic fundamentals, matters. These are all things that we observe among our top 20 country ranks in the global opportunity index. These top 20 countries really attract around 60% of capital inflows generally around the world. That is, Manita is establishing new factories, new businesses that could generate work. It has been found that an increase in foreign direct investment is correlated with job generation, especially formal jobs for people that may be working in the informal economy and that would be looking to move into the formal economy. Now is it that's going to be a change that happens overnight? No. But in the long term, it could have effects on a person's day-to-day life. That was Maggie Sweetech, lead author of the Milkin Institute's Global Opportunity Index. Maggie, thanks so much for being here. Thank you so much, pleasure.
