uke Vargas: European intelligence services warn of a new terror threat linked to Iran and the Gaza war. They were posing as refugees, but they had automatic rifles, they had pistols, they had ammunition, and on their mobile phones they had pictures of Jewish and Israeli targets in Europe. Plus the Prime Minister of Haiti agrees to resign as violence rages in the Caribbean nation. And Chinese EV giant BYD struggles with its overseas expansion amid a slew of quality control issues. It's Tuesday, March 12th. I'm Luke Vargas for The Wall Street Journal. And here is the AM edition of What's News. The top headlines and business stories moving your world today. We begin in Haiti where embattled Prime Minister Ariel Henry has agreed to resign as violence rages on in the Caribbean nation. Henry, who has been holed up in Puerto Rico and unable to return to Haiti will reportedly step aside once a transitional council and interim leader are named, moves that are meant to set in motion in election as quickly as possible. Irfaan Ali is the President of Guyana and Chairman of the Caribbean Community, a political and economic union that along with the US has been calling for a transition of power in a bid to stabilize Haiti. Whatever we do must be what the Haitian people want of us. That is the important point. It is not what we want, it is what the Haitian people want of us. What we exercise leadership as a region in being proactive. However, Haiti faces a challenging return back to stability as Caribbean leaders navigate engagement with the country's powerful gangs. US spy agencies say that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership is in jeopardy and that Israel will have difficulty eliminating Hamas. That is according to the US's Annual Threat Assessment, which said that distrust of Netanyahu's ability to rule has deepened and that a different, more moderate government is a possibility. That report comes as Netanyahu's leadership is facing pressure from within Israel's war cabinet, which includes rivals including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Benny Gantz, the leader of the National Unity Party, whom polls suggest would win if an election was held now. The assessment also found that Israel is likely to face lingering armed resistance from Hamas for years to come, and that the military will struggle to neutralize Hamas' underground infrastructure, which allows insurgents to hide, regain strength and surprise Israeli forces. Meanwhile, we are exclusively reporting that authorities in Europe are warning of a different threat linked to Iran and the Israel-Hamas war. Correspondent Bojan Pancevski told me that after a wave of terror attacks hit Europe starting in 2015, that were largely inspired by the Islamic State, security services in several countries are now monitoring threats coming from a growing list of new sources. There is a growing threat from actors such as Iran and its proxies in the Middle East, notably Hamas. This is what intelligence agencies are telling me. And there are a number of conspiracies involving Iranian sleeper agents who had been sent into Europe as refugees, et cetera, plotting to kill Jewish people or attack Israeli targets. Now the same is happening with Hamas, and this is extremely worrying because Hamas has never been known to try and do stuff like that here in Europe. Rather, the group has been using Europe as a hub for financing, hiding its fighters for logistics, et cetera. Now, apparently they've started planning attacks themselves, which is a new level of escalation. Bojan, I know we don't color code terror threats anymore, but just how seriously should we be taking this threat? Well, from my conversations, if there were a color code, it would be red. Late last year in December, there was a string of arrests of Hamas operatives who had been apparently dispatched to actually execute some of these attacks to target Jewish communities. They've tapped into a secret stash of weapons that was put there by Hamas some time ago. So it is quite serious. Similarly, with operatives from Iran, operatives from the IS. These groups, they don't work together necessarily, but they pose a combined convergent threat, the kind of which we haven't actually seen in Europe. That was Journal Correspondent Bojan Pancevski. Coming up. After overtaking Tesla, Chinese car maker BYD is finding that its rapid growth at home doesn't necessarily translate into success overseas. Plus we'll look ahead to today's U.S. inflation report. Those stories and more after the break. Today's U.S. inflation report will be front of mind for investors and for the Fed, who will be parsing the data for clues on where the economy's headed and what that means for us interest rates. Quentin Webb is the Journal's Deputy Finance Editor for Europe. On a core basis, CPI has seen up 0.3% this month. February overall, CPI has seen up 0.4%. This comes soon after the February jobs report. The headline figure was a bit stronger than expected, but then at the same time we had some revisions downwards. Previous months wage growth slowed a bit, so we do seem to be headed towards this point where both the labor market and inflation are in a state where the Fed feels comfortable to start cutting rates. Now, almost no one expects that to be at this meeting in March, but it could be in one of the coming meetings later in the spring or early summer. The February inflation report is due out at 8:30 AM Eastern. US aluminum producer, Alcoa, is buying Alumina in a deal that values the Australian company's equity at roughly $2.2 billion. That follows weeks of talks over an offer that will help to cement Alcoa as one of the world's largest bauxite and Alumina producers. The deal represents a bet on commodities expected to play an essential role in the energy transition and comes as the mining industry has experienced a recent flurry of mergers and acquisitions. Alumina expects shareholders to vote on the deal in the third quarter. And Apple may have ended its quest to build an electric vehicle earlier this year, but that doesn't mean that other phone makers can't take on the challenge. Well, China's Xiaomi, best known for its popular smartphones and home appliances, is set to do just that later this month, launching a four door EV sedan that it hopes will capture consumer interest. And while the announcement sent Xiaomi's stock up more than 9% today, the company will be entering the fray as leading brands like Tesla and China's BYD (inaudible) as economic pressures weigh on demand. Well, speaking of BYD, the Chinese car maker last year passed Tesla as the top global seller of Evs. And the company isn't stopping there, with its executives hoping to sell 400,000 vehicles outside of China this year. But as Journal Reporter River Davis writes, some recent delivery hiccups are showing that that target could be hard to hit. And they're coming at a time when questions are already swirling about the health of the broader EV market. River, BYD, this is a serious automaker here, having delivered more than 1.8 million cars last year around the world. It's also counted on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as an investor dating back all the way to 2008. And yet as you report lately, it's been running into what sound like some sort of elementary hiccups. BYD came onto everyone's radar for the first time last year, largely because it overtook Tesla as the largest EV maker in the world in the fourth quarter of last year. But what you have to understand about the company is that the vast majority of that growth and its current demand is within China itself, the world's biggest car market. But what we're seeing now is that it's trying to sustain that growth. The Chinese car market has been stagnant for a number of years now. BYD is now looking overseas to try and capture more growth there, and it is having some initial stumbles when it comes to that push. We're seeing that the company has overestimated demand for its cars. It's pushed quite heavily into Europe recently, and executives at the company there have flagged that demand just isn't to the level that they had expected. And on the other front, it's also facing a slow buildup of quality issues. Yeah. And you cite in your reporting a range of those quality issues, from a bus delivered to London that caught fire when it was left unattended. Other vehicles showed up in Europe with mold inside them. Could these incidents be symptoms perhaps of broader issues? First, we should definitely note that none of these quality issues have developed into a major scandal for the company thus far that would require massive amounts of recalls, that type of level of problem. They're treating, on the ground, a number of issues including mold, recoding cars, fixing scratches and blemishes. This could actually build into a really big problem for the company because this method of ad hoc fixes that sometimes works when you have a small business, but if you're attempting to scale at the pace and level that top management is pushing the company to do, then the system might fall apart. Some people are saying, "We need to take a more measured approach to exporting cars. We need to understand the consumer's needs in overseas markets and standards there before we push ahead this quickly to expand." All right. So going back to the drawing board there maybe a little bit, making sure the company's plans align with the market. Though we should point out, the market is in many ways out of BYD's control. EV makers are facing some big headwinds now. Yeah. Absolutely. The past year there's been a bit of a change in the trajectory of EVs globally. So sales are still growing, but the pace of that growth has slowed in a lot of major markets including the US, China, more recently, Germany. BYD has also been hit recently. I think its market cap is down by about a fifth from summer last year. The other big issue is regulatory challenges. In Europe, imported cars have a 10% tariff on them and local authorities are looking into whether the subsidies that BYD has received through the years from the Chinese state might warrant more tariffs on the vehicles. The US also has more than a 27% tariff placed on Chinese EVs. Yeah. Some pretty big market hurdles there, River. And if that outlook doesn't improve, is it clear what the company or Beijing for that matter might do to try to step in? Yes. We've already seen this tit-for-tat. If you put heavy tariffs on Chinese cars, then we will tariff other goods. That's been going on a bit between Europe and China recently. But at the same time, BYD is trying to figure out strategies to work around these regulatory challenges. It's setting up local production facilities in Uzbekistan and Hungary that would export to Europe. And recently we've reported that they are planning to build a plant in Mexico actually. The company has come out and said, "We're not targeting sales to the US at the moment." But if they're exporting from Mexico, they don't face the same level of tariffs likely as they would face from exporting from China. And of course it can just ship cars south where it's already targeting a big boost in sales in Latin America anyway. So it's figuring out its own strategies and it definitely has the weight of Beijing behind it. Because as the Chinese economy stumbles, Beijing is looking at solar panels, electric cars, batteries, as these new pillars of technology growth that it really seeks to capitalize on. And at least in the sector of electric vehicles, BYD has very much become the poster child of that push. Well, we'll be watching very closely. That was Wall Street Journal Reporter River Davis joining me from Tokyo. River, thank you so much as always. Yeah, thank you so much. And finally, companies around the world are taking on the challenges of expensive EV batteries, slow charging and range anxiety by looking to the road for answers. Regan Zane directs the ASPIRE Research Center at Utah State University where researchers are studying electric roads capable of wirelessly charging vehicles via coils beneath the asphalt. And he told our Future of Everything podcast that the technology which is already being piloted could unlock dramatic changes in how EVs are made and crucially what they cost. The vehicle would weigh less, meaning it requires less energy to move it per mile. You would have a relatively small battery, maybe 100 miles at most for most people. That means that the cost of the vehicle is relatively low. We could have $10,000, $15,000 electric vehicles. For fleets, for trucks, it's the same story, but now the numbers are much bigger. And given that installing enough electric roads to make that a reality could take a while, Magnus Vold, the Chief Commercial Officer of ENRX, which develops wireless charging systems for EVs, said that more controlled environments like factories could emerge as shorter term proving grounds for the technology. If you think about the warehouse, for instance, where you have a forklift that is going and it wants to go 24/7 and it's automated, why should it stop for charging? If you make the floor electric instead, the forklift would be able to charge while it's driving and you would never have to stop for charging. Those kinds of application in industry are probably going to take off commercially long before the EVs.
